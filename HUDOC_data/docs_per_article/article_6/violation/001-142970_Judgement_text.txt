The case originated in an application (no. 63655/11) against the Republic of Slovenia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovenian national, Mr Danilo Mavrič (“the applicant”), on 5 October 2011.
The applicant was represented by Odvetniška družba Brulc, Gaberščik in Kikelj, o.p., d.o.o., a law firm practising in Ljubljana. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Vran, State Attorney.
On 27 June 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government did not object to the examination of the application by a Committee.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Ig.
On 9 June 2008 the police fined the applicant 333.83 euros (EUR) for verbally and physically assaulting Š.S. The applicant lodged a request for judicial review in which he contested the finding of the police that he had hit Š.S. in the head. He requested that he and two witnesses who had been present on the spot at the time of the alleged commission of the minor offence be heard.
On 4 March 2011 the Ljubljana Local Court heard the two witnesses proposed by the applicant, a police officer and another witness. On the basis of their submissions it rejected the applicant’s request for judicial review.
On 8 June 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal complaining that because the Local Court had failed to inform him and his lawyer of the hearing, he could not examine the witnesses and did not have any opportunity to be heard.
On 13 September 2011 the Constitutional Court rejected the constitutional appeal as inadmissible.
For the relevant provisions of the Minor Offences Act (hereinafter “the MOA”) and the Constitutional Court Act, see Suhadolc v. Slovenia ((dec.), no. 57655/08, 17 May 2011) and Flisar v. Slovenia (no. 3127/09, §§ 13-18, 29 September 2011).
Section 169 of the MOA provides:
“(1) A request for protection of legality may be filed against any decision issued at the second instance or against any final decision, if this Act or regulation governing minor offences has been violated.
(2) A request for protection of legality may be filed by a public prosecutor ex officlo or at the initiative of a person who has the right to appeal against a minor offence judgment issued by a court of first instance.”
On 13 March 2011 Section 65 of the MOA was amended to the effect that the court shall inform the offender of its intention to repeat or supplement the evidence-taking procedure. However, that amendment was not in force at the time of taking the first-instance decision in the applicant’s case.
