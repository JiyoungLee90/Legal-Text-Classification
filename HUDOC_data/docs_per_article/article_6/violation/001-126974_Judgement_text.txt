The case originated in two applications (nos. 28686/06 and 50135/06) against the Republic of Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Serbian nationals, Ms Gvozdena Sekulić (“the first applicant”) and Ms Sabaheta Kučević (“the second applicant”), on 20 June 2006 and 4 December 2006, respectively.
The first applicant was represented by Ms M. Popović and Ms Š. Dolovac, while the second applicant was represented by Ms R. Garibović, all lawyers practising in Novi Pazar. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
The applicants alleged that the State had violated their rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 thereto, due to its failure to enforce final domestic judgments rendered in their favour. The first applicant, in addition, alleged that she had had no effective domestic remedy at her disposal in that respect.
On 17 August 2009 the applications were communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
The first and second applicants were born in 1952 and 1965 respectively, and live in Novi Pazar.
The first applicant was employed by Raška Holding AD – Pamučna predionica DOO (“the first debtor”), and the second applicant was employed by Raška Holding AD – Dorada tkanina DOO (“the second debtor”). The debtors are limited liability companies owned by the “Raška Holding Kompanija” (“the mother company”).
On 14 May 1996 and 15 May 1996 respectively, the applicants were placed on compulsory paid leave until such time as normal production could be resumed and the said debtors’ business performance had improved sufficiently.
Whilst on this leave, in accordance with the relevant domestic legislation, the applicants were entitled to a significantly reduced monthly income, as well as the payment of their pension, disability and other social security contributions.
Since the debtors failed to fulfil these obligations, the applicants brought numerous separate civil claims before the Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) in Novi Pazar (hereinafter “the Municipal Court”).

On 5 November 2004 the debtors’ mother company (see paragraph 7 above) proposed the Redundant Employees Programme (Program rešavanja viška zaposlenih – hereinafter “the redundancy programme”). The redundancy programme set out the criteria for determining redundant employees and, once declared redundant, provided them with two options for benefits: (i) to receive a single redundancy payment from the employer (jednokratna novčana naknada); or (ii) to receive a severance payment and claim monthly unemployment benefits from the social security of the State (otpremnina i novčana naknada). These benefits were provided for all employees, regardless of whether they had any other outstanding claim towards the company.
On 7 December 2005 and 8 December 2005, the first and the second applicant, respectively, opted for the single redundancy payment.
On 16 October 2006 and 4 September 2006 the mother company issued decisions terminating the first and the second applicant’s employment as of 11 October 2006 and 12 September 2006, respectively. Consequently, as of that date all the rights and obligations arising from the applicants’ employment were terminated.
On an unspecified date the first applicant, and on 12 September 2006 the second applicant signed an agreement with their employer regulating mutual outstanding debts on account of loans or other claims, and on account of due salaries and pension and disability contributions, respectively. Without specifying any amount of the outstanding debts, the agreement provided for, inter alia, the employer’s obligation to pay its outstanding debt within six months, failing which the applicants were entitled to lodge a civil claim for compensation.
On 11 October 2006 and 12 October 2006 the mother company paid to the first applicant and the second applicant each RSD 299,700 (EUR 3,700) on account of the redundancy payment.
On 9 February 2007 and 9 October 2007 the due pension and disability contributions were paid.
On 5 November 2004 the Privatization Agency (Agencija za privatizaciju) initiated the restructuring of the mother company, which is still ongoing. As of July 2013, the debtors still consisted of predominantly socially-owned and State-owned capital.
