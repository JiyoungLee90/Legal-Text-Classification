The case originated in an application (no. 35185/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mrs Anelya Vatslavivna Gurska (“the applicant”), on 24 September 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaitsev.
On 5 December 2005 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in the , the Zhytomyr Region.
By three judgments of 18 February, 5 March and 20 May 2003 the  ordered the Sobolivka Village Council to pay the applicant UAH 4,097.01 in salary arrears and other payments.
The Romaniv Town Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the first judgment on 3 March 2003 and in respect of two other judgments on 26 June 2003.
On 14 June 2003 the Bailiffs’ Service discontinued the enforcement proceedings on the ground that the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine had not foreseen the order of payment of such judgment debts.
In January 2004 the applicant lodged a complaint with the same court against the Bailiffs’ Service for failure to enforce the judgments in her favour. On 5 February 2004 the court rejected her claim, finding no fault on the part of the Bailiffs’ Service. On 8 April 2004 the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the first instance court. The courts held that the judgments could not be enforced as there were no procedure regulating the seizure of funds from the accounts of the State Treasury. The applicant’s appeal in cassation is still pending before the Supreme Court of Ukraine.
On an unspecified date the applicant received UAH 364.92. The judgments remain to a large extent unenforced (UAH 3,732.09).
