The case originated in an application (no. 29435/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Ms Raisa Andreyevna Luganskaya (“the applicant”), on 2 August 2004.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 5 December 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the non-enforcement of the judgments in the applicant's favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in the town of Novogrodivka, Donetsk region, .
On 5 May and 21 July 2003, respectively, the Novogrodivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Новогродівського міського управління юстиції) instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the above judgments.
The Novogrodivska Mining Company was reorganised and became a structural subdivision of the Selidovvugillya Mining Company. As the latter thereby became the debtor, the enforcement proceedings were transferred to the Selidivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Селидівського міського управління юстиції).
