The case originated in an application (no. 37039/03) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Ukrainian national, Mr Nikolay Mikhaylovich Kislinskiy (“the applicant”), on 16 October 2003.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by theirs Agent, Mrs Zoryana Bortnovska and Mr Yuriy Zaytsev.
On 9 September 2004 and on 11 January 2006 the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of the Protocol No.1 concerning the non-enforcement of a final court judgment given in the applicant’s favour. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in the town of , the Donetsk Region.
On 30 June 1998 the Novogrodivka City Court (hereafter “the City Court”) awarded the applicant UAH 2,550 against the Rosiya coal-mine (a State-owned enterprise) by way of compensation for delays in the payment of his occupational disease benefits. On 10 July 1998 the judgment became final and was sent to the Novogrodovka City Bailiffs’ Service (hereafter “the Bailiffs”) for compulsory enforcement.
On 20 February 2003 the City Court rejected the applicant’s further claim against the same coal-mine in December 2002. On 5 May 2003 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this decision. On 21 Mai 2004 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation.
In early 2004 the applicant complained to the City Court about the Bailiffs’ alleged inactivity. On 30 April 2004 the City Court rejected the applicant’s complaint stating, inter alia, that no fault was attributable to the Bailiffs, who had undertaken all necessary measures to secure the execution of the June 1998 judgment, and that its non-enforcement was due to the moratorium on the forced sale of the property of State-owned enterprises. The City Court also indicated that the enforcement proceedings were further impeded by the decision of 25 February 2003 of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy (which controlled 100% of the Rosiya coal-mine) to wind up the enterprise and to transfer its assets to the Selidovvugillya State Company. The latter entity was designated as the judgment debtor by decision of the City Court of 12 December 2003.
On 25 November 2004 the enforcement proceedings were terminated as the judgment in the applicant’s favour had been enforced in full.
