The case originated in nine applications (nos. 20707/06, 29518/06, 39006/06, 7527/07, 7678/07, 18756/07, 36533/07, 46727/07 and 55639/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by nine Russian nationals (“the applicants”). The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On various dates (indicated in the Appendix) these complaints were communicated to the respondent Government.
All the applicants were party to civil proceedings in which the firstinstance and appeal courts found in their favour. These judgments became binding and enforceable but were subsequently quashed by the supervisory review courts on the ground of incorrect application of substantive law or incorrect assessment of evidence by lower courts (for more details see the Appendix).
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summarised in Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
