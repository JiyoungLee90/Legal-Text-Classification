The case originated in two applications (nos. 4292/04 and 4347/04) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Ms Ganna Petrivna Glova and Ms Nadiya Fedorivna Bregin (“the applicants”), on 15 and 5 December 2003 respectively.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs V. Lutkovska.
On 25 October 2004 the Court decided to communicate to the Government the complaints under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention concerning non-enforcement of the judgments favourable to the applicants. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
Both applicants were born in 1943. Ms Glova and Ms Bregin reside respectively in the villages of Podillya and Tovste, the Ternopil region, .
In March 2000 the applicants instituted two separate sets of proceedings in the Zalishchytskiy District Court of Ternopil Region against the Zalishchytskiy State Department for Education seeking recovery of payments due to them. On 15 May 2000, the court found for Ms Glova and awarded her UAH 1,015. On 16 May 2000, the court found in part for Ms Bregin and awarded her UAH 1,595. On 13 June 2000, the  upheld both decisions of the first instance court. The decisions became final, but have been enforced only in part.
In March 2003 the Zalishchytskiy State Department for Education requested the Zalishchytskiy District Court to suspend the enforcement of judgments of 15 and 16 May 2000 due to a lack of budget funds and an absence of a mechanism to pay the State’s debts to teachers. On 22 April 2003, the court allowed the requests and decided to suspend the enforcement proceedings until such a mechanism had been elaborated. On 24 June and 1 July 2003 respectively the Ternopil Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decisions of 22 April 2003. The applicants did not appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court.
The judgments in favour of Ms Glova and Ms Bregin remain unenforced in part (UAH 275 and UAH 855 respectively).
The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).
