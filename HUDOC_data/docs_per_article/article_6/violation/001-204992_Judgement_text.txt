The applicant complained, in particular, that the quashing, upon an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the Prosecutor General, of a final and binding decision in his favour had been contrary to his rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Považská Bystrica. He was represented by Mr R. Fatura, a lawyer practising in Považská Bystrica.
The Government were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková, and her co-agent Ms M. Bálintová.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
By a decision of 8 August 1997, the Banská Bystrica Regional Court (Krajský súd – “the Regional Court”) declared insolvent (konkurz) an agricultural cooperative, D. (“the insolvent party”), and requested its creditors to submit their claims (nárok) in the framework of the insolvency proceedings no later than thirty days from the adoption of the decision. The applicant, a lawyer, was appointed as the insolvency administrator (správca konkurznej podstaty).
On 28 January 1999 the Regional Court held an examination hearing (prieskumné pojednávanie) to examine the claims that had been submitted in time by the creditors, and the amounts of those claims. Several additional hearings took place in the following years (on 20 January 2003, 19 December 2005, 28 May 2007 and 30 January 2009).
On 13 January 2011 the Regional Court approved the applicant’s final report on the liquidation of the insolvent party’s assets (konečná správa o speňažení majetku z konkurznej podstaty). The report included a calculation of the applicant’s remuneration (odmena) for the work carried out in the amount of 139,376.80 euros (EUR). It had been calculated by the applicant in accordance with Article 7 § 1 of Decree no. 493/1991 Coll. on the enforcement of certain provisions of the Insolvency Act (vyhláška Ministerstva spravodlivosti Slovenskej republiky č. 493/1991 Zb., ktorou sa vykonávajú niektoré ustanovenia zákona o konkurze a vyrovnaní – “the Decree”), as applicable before its amendment by two subsequent decrees (Decree no. 389/2001 Coll., in force as of 29 September 2001, and Decree no. 398/2001 Coll., in force as of 8 October 2001 – “the amendments”). This calculation, and hence the application of the “pre-amendment” version of the Decree, was accepted by the Regional Court as being correct.
One of the insolvent party’s creditors, C.E.F.M., a private joint-stock company with its seat in Prague (“the creditor”), appealed against the decision (odvolanie), challenging the amount of the remuneration calculated by the applicant, which in its view infringed the property rights of the creditors. It referred to the amended Decree, which had altered the way of calculating insolvency administrators’ remuneration (the amendment in force as of 29 September 2001) and which was applicable in cases where the examination hearing had not ended prior to 8 October 2001 (the amendment in force as of 8 October 2001). Relying on a Supreme Court decision (no. 4 Obo 40/2004 of 17 February 2004), according to which an examination hearing was concluded upon the examination of the last claim submitted in time, the creditor argued that in the present case the examination hearing had not ended before 8 October 2001, the last claim having been examined on 30 January 2009. Therefore, in its view, the Regional Court should have applied the amended provisions and granted the applicant EUR 66,880.44.
On 31 August 2011 the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) upheld the decision of the Regional Court, endorsing its reasoning. It ruled that the regular examination hearing had taken place on 28 January 1999, that is, before the amendments had come into force. Therefore, the Regional Court had correctly applied the legislation in force prior to those amendments when determining the amount of the applicant’s remuneration.
According to the applicant, the remuneration was paid to him in January 2012.
After the Supreme Court’s decision became final, on 31 May 2012 the Regional Court adopted a “distribution decision” (rozvrhové uznesenie), specifying how the liquidated assets were to be distributed among the creditors in order to satisfy their individual claims. That decision, partially rectified by a decision of 14 June 2012 (opravné rozvrhové uznesenie), was upheld by the Supreme Court on 14 December 2012.
On 3 October 2012 the Prosecutor General lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law (mimoriadne dovolanie) on behalf of the creditor, challenging the courts’ decisions of 13 January and 31 August 2011. He argued that the courts had breached the law by failing to correctly determine the exact date of the conclusion of the examination hearing. He submitted that all the individual hearings that had taken place between 28 January 1999 and 30 January 2009 represented a unified process with the aim of examining the creditors’ claims. This process had ended on 30 January 2009, the date of the last additional examination hearing. Hence, the courts had erred by applying the provisions in force prior to the amendments when determining the amount of the applicant’s remuneration.
The Supreme Court invited the applicant and the creditor to submit their observations.
The applicant contested the Prosecutor General’s reasoning, arguing that it was entirely incorrect and contrary to the prohibition on the retroactive application of the law. He argued that insolvency proceedings were to be carried out in accordance with the law in force at the time when the insolvent party had been declared insolvent. He also complained of the excessive length of the insolvency proceedings. Referring to the final and partially enforced distribution decision (in application of which he had already satisfied certain creditors’ claims), the applicant proposed that the Prosecutor General’s extraordinary appeal be dismissed as manifestly illfounded.
The creditor fully endorsed the Prosecutor General’s reasoning and reiterated its previous arguments, according to which the applicant had enriched himself to its detriment as a result of the incorrect application of the domestic law.
On 13 December 2016 the Supreme Court allowed the extraordinary appeal, quashed the two impugned decisions and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It also quashed the distribution decision, as rectified on 14 June 2012 and upheld by the Supreme Court on 14 December 2012, since it was directly dependent on the impugned decisions.
The Supreme Court emphasised that an extraordinary appeal on points of law was to be used only in exceptional cases, as it represented an exception to the principle of legal certainty. It found that in the circumstances of the case before it the remedy was procedurally admissible, as no other remedies were available to the creditor (the Insolvency Act ruled out the possibility of lodging an ordinary appeal on points of law).
The Supreme Court highlighted the aim of insolvency proceedings, namely to ensure proportionate satisfaction of the creditors’ claims to the greatest extent possible. It held that there could be no interference with the applicant’s right to property because the law protected only ownership that had been acquired in accordance with its correct application. The applicant, a lawyer, had been under a duty to submit his final report accordingly, that is, in compliance with the applicable law. Under these circumstances, the protection of the property rights of the creditors outweighed the premise that final judgments should not be quashed.
The Supreme Court found that the last claim had been addressed at the additional examination hearing of 30 January 2009, which was the relevant date for the determination of the applicable law. The courts had failed to apply the amended Decree and had violated the rights of the creditors.
The Supreme Court’s decision was served on the applicant on 27 January 2017. The further course of the insolvency proceedings is described in paragraphs 18 et seq. below.
On 28 March 2017 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, invoking his rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He challenged the reasons given by the Supreme Court to justify the quashing of a final and enforceable decision in his favour, and complained of the length of the proceedings before the Supreme Court.
By a decision of 19 April 2017 (III. US 264/2017), the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as manifestly illfounded. It ruled that, in its decision of 13 December 2016, the Supreme Court had acted in accordance with the law, had addressed his arguments and had provided adequate reasoning. It dismissed the applicant’s complaint concerning the length of the proceedings before the Supreme Court on the grounds that he had failed to substantiate his allegations and had failed to complain while those proceedings had still been pending before that court.
Following the quashing of the decisions of 13 January and 31 August 2011 (see paragraph 14 above), the case was remitted to the Regional Court for re-examination in the light of the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court.
By a decision of 14 November 2018, the Regional Court approved the applicant’s final report with some alterations; in particular, it increased the amount of the liquidated assets to be distributed among the creditors and reduced the amount of remuneration for the work carried out by the applicant, calculating it at EUR 59,910.30. The applicant was asked to return the difference in the amounts. The decision was upheld on appeal by the applicant and became final on 20 August 2019.
The Constitutional Court dismissed a second constitutional complaint by the applicant against the courts’ decisions as manifestly illfounded (I. US 330/2019).
On 17 June 2019 the Regional Court adopted a new distribution decision. On 23 October 2019 the Supreme Court quashed it on grounds unrelated to the calculation of the applicant’s remuneration and the relevant part of the case was remitted back to the Regional Court.
The relevant domestic law and practice and European texts have been summarised in the Court’s judgments in, inter alia, DRAFT - OVA a.s. v. Slovakia (no. 72493/10, §§ 39-56 and 58-61, 9 June 2015, with further references) and Bosits v. Slovakia [Committee] (no. 75041/17, §§ 17-20, 19 May 2020).
Article 449 of the new Code of Civil Contentious Procedure (Law no. 160/2015, which was adopted on 21 May 2015 and came into force on 1 July 2016) provides that if an appeal on points of law is well founded, the court will quash the impugned decision.
