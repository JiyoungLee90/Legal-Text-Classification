The applicant’s objection against the indictment filed with the Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) was of no avail.
On 30 May 1988 the Public Prosecutor’s Office requested the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) that jurisdiction over the case be transferred to the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) on the ground that the applicant and her husband would move to Vienna and that numerous witnesses were residing there.

Between 18 December 1990 and 5 September 1991, the , sitting with two professional and two lay judges, held further trial hearings against the applicant and the co-accused. Numerous witnesses as well as an expert on bookkeeping were heard.
On 11 July 1991, i.e. the fifteenth trial day, the  decided to disjoin the proceedings against the applicant from those against the co-accused due to her poor state of health. The proceedings against the co-accused were continued.

On 5 September 1991 the  convicted the applicant’s husband of continued aggravated fraud (gewerbsmässiger schwerer Betrug), fraudulent bankruptcy (betrügerische Krida), fraudulent conversion (Veruntreuung) and false testimony (falsche Beweisaussage vor Gericht).
On 26 November 1992 the Supreme Court quashed the ’s decision regarding the conviction of the applicant’s husband relating to the counts on aggravated fraud and fraudulent bankruptcy, but confirmed his conviction as regards the other charges, quashed the sentence and referred the case to the  for further proceedings.

On 14 December 1994 the expert requested the submission of these documents, which he inspected on 6 March 1995.
Meanwhile, on 17 October 1994 the proceedings against the applicant were again joined with those against her husband.
On 7 November 1996 the first part of the expert report arrived at the court. The remainder arrived on 16 April 1997.
On 9 August 1997 the file was transferred to the trial court, which, on 1 December 1997, fixed a hearing for 20 January 1998.
On 20 January 1998, namely the first trial day in the second round of proceedings, the Wels Regional Court again decided to disjoin the proceedings against the applicant from those against her husband on account of her poor health.
On 19 March 1998 the proceedings against the applicant were again joined with the proceedings against her husband.
Between 20 January 1998 and 18 December 1998, the  held ten hearings and, on the latter date, convicted the applicant of fraudulent bankruptcy and sentenced her to six months imprisonment suspended on probation.
