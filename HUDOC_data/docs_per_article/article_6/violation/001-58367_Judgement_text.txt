The case was referred to the Court by Mr Ernst Lughofer and Mrs Anna Lughofer (“the applicants”), Austrian nationals, on 22 October 1998, within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It originated in an application (no. 22811/93) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by the applicants. The applicants are represented by Mr E. Proksch, a lawyer practising in Vienna (Austria). The Government of Austria are represented by their Agent, Mr F. Cede, Ambassador, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicants’ application to the Court referred to Article 48 as amended by Protocol No. 9, which Austria had ratified. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
Following the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 4 thereof read in conjunction with Rule 100 § 1 and Rule 24 § 6 of the Rules of Court, a Panel of the Grand Chamber decided on 14 January 1999 that the case should be dealt with by a Chamber constituted within one of the Sections of the Court.
In accordance with Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court, the President of the Court, Mr L. Wildhaber, assigned the case to the Third Section. The Chamber ultimately constituted within the Section included Mr. J.-P. Costa, Mr P. Kūris, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr W. Fuhrmann, Mr K. Jungwiert, Mrs H.S. Greve and Mr K. Traja.
On 12 March 1999 the President of the Chamber invited the parties to submit a memorial on the issues of the case. By letter of 29 April 1999 the applicants informed the Court that they did not wish to submit a memorial; on 17 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of the case.
After consulting the Agent of the Government and applicants’ lawyer the Chamber decided not to hold a hearing in the case.
The applicants' farm was the object of land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren) instituted by the Gmunden District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbehörde) on 22 February 1973.
On 21 August 1984 the District Authority held a hearing at which the farmers concerned could express their wishes (Wunschverhandlung) and on 22 August 1985 the District Authority ordered the provisional transfer of the properties concerned, inter alia, land owned by the applicants. In July 1989 the District Authority issued a consolidation plan (Zusammenlegungsplan). The applicants appealed, claiming that they had not received adequate land in exchange for their parcels AK 2 and AK 8. On 5 July 1990 the Upper Austria Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat) dismissed the applicants' appeal after an oral hearing held in private, but in the presence of the parties and their lawyer.
On 25 September 1990 the applicants filed a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) against the above decision. They also asked the Court to hold an oral hearing.
On 15 December 1992 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint, rejecting at the same time, in accordance with Section 39 (2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act, the applicants' request for an oral hearing.
Section 9 (1) of the Federal Agricultural Proceedings Act (Agrarverfahrensgesetz) provided as follows:
	"Land Reform Boards take their decisions after an oral hearing in the presence of the parties."
It is the constant practice of administrative authorities to hold oral hearings in camera unless the law provides otherwise.
By virtue of legislation enacted in December 1993 (Bundesgesetzblatt no. 901, p. 7160), hearings before Land Reform Boards are now public.
Pursuant to Section 36 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz), proceedings consist essentially in an exchange of written pleadings. If one of the parties so requests the Administrative Court may hold a hearing which is in principle held in public (Sections 39 (1) no. 1 and 40 (4)).
Section 39 (1) of the Administrative Court Act provides that the Administrative Court is to hold a hearing after its preliminary investigation of the case where a complainant has requested a hearing within the time-limit. Section 39 (2) no. 6, which was added to the Act in 1982, provides however:
"Notwithstanding a party's application ..., the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where ...
it is apparent to the Court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that an oral hearing is not likely to clarify the case further."
The applicants applied to the Commission on 27 September 1993. They alleged, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the lack of a public hearing in the land consolidation proceedings.
The Commission declared the application (no. 22811/93) partly admissible on 16 April 1998. In its report of 9 September 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
By letter of 17 May 1999 the Government conceded that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the circumstances of this application.
