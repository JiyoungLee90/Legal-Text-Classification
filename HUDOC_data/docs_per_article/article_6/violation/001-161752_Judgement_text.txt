The case originated in an application (no. 47082/12) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Mr Zoran Paić (“the applicant”), on 9 July 2012.
The applicant was represented by Ms A. Giljanović, a lawyer practising in Šibenik. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had had no opportunity to question the only prosecution witness in the criminal proceedings against him.
On 9 February 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Šibenik.
On 26 August 2005 the Šibenik Municipal State Attorney’s Office opened an investigation against the applicant on suspicion of the theft of a mobile telephone from E.R., who had come to Croatia as a tourist from the Czech Republic.
On 20 September 2005 an investigating judge of the Šibenik County Court heard the applicant, who denied the charges against him. He explained that on the occasion in question some children from a house in Betina had thrown water-filled balloons at him. He had approached the house the children had come from and had knocked at the door, but no one had answered. He had then walked away. When he was back at home, two young women had come to ask for the mobile telephone belonging to one of them, but he told them he had not taken it.
In response to a request for international legal assistance from the Croatian prosecuting authorities, on 9 June 2006 the Chomutovo County Court in the Czech Republic heard evidence from E.R. She said that on 12 July 2005 in Betina, Croatia, her children had thrown water-filled balloons at the applicant. He had then approached the house they were staying in and through a window she had seen him steal her mobile telephone from a table on the terrace of that house. Together with her step-daughter she had followed the applicant to his house and asked him to return her telephone. However, he had denied taking it.
On 9 November 2006 the Šibenik Municipal State Attorney’s Office indicted the applicant in the Šibenik Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Šibeniku) on the charge of stealing a mobile telephone from E.R.
During his trial before the Šibenik Municipal Court the applicant gave oral evidence on 18 May 2010. He reiterated the statement he had given before the investigating judge. Throughout these proceedings the applicant challenged the allegation against him, contending that, although there had been a dispute between him and E.R. over the behaviour of her children, he had not stolen her mobile telephone. The applicant’s account was confirmed in essence by his former wife, who was also questioned as a witness during the proceedings.
At a hearing held on 27 October 2010 the Šibenik Municipal Court decided to admit the record of E.R.’s questioning as evidence without examining her directly. The applicant objected to the reading out of E.R.’s statement.
On 28 October 2010 the Šibenik Municipal Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment suspended for one year. The finding of the applicant’s guilt was based solely on the evidence given by E.R. The trial court held that it was clear that the applicant had been the person who had approached the house where E.R. and her family were staying. The evidence given by E.R. conclusively showed that the applicant had committed the offence at issue and that E.R. had no reason “to blame the accused without basis”. The relevant part of the first-instance judgment reads:
“Under Article 331 § 1(12) of the Code of Criminal Procedure this court read out the statement given by E.R. before the Chomutovo County Court, the Czech Republic, on 9 June 2009 without the parties’ consent because there were sound reasons for doing so, namely that the victim gave her evidence more than four years ago and this court considers that, owing to the passage of time, it would not learn any new facts or circumstances relevant for assessing the circumstances of the event [at issue], and was also mindful of the fact that the [charges against the accused] will become time-barred in July 2011 and ... summoning the victim would protract the criminal proceedings unnecessarily.
...
... considering the evidence given by witness and victim E.R. as being credible and truthful, this court has established the criminal responsibility of the accused because it has not found in the victim’s statement any reason for which she would blame the accused without basis. ...”
In his appeal of 28 January 2011 the applicant argued, inter alia, that E.R. had never been summoned to a hearing during his trial before the Šibenik Municipal Court and that he had had no opportunity to question her. He also argued that E.R.’s mobile telephone had not been found in his possession. On 3 March 2011 the Šibenik County Court (Županijski sud u Šibeniku) dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, upholding the first-instance judgment. The relevant part of the appeal judgment reads as follows:
“In the reasoning of its judgment, the [first-instance] court stated the reasons why it had decided ... to read out the statement of the witness-victim E.R., stating that the victim had given her evidence more than four years previously, at which time her recollection of the event [at issue] would have been fresher than later, that the prosecution would become time-barred in July 2011 and since [the victim] was a foreign citizen ... summoning her [to a hearing] would protract the criminal proceedings unnecessarily.
... This decision of the first-instance court did not violate the defence rights of the accused ...
...
... it should also be said that the mobile telephone could not have been found in the accused’s possession because nobody looked for it. The documents in the case-file show that the accused’s home was not searched, which was a mistake on the part of the police. However, even without it, the [first-instance] court undoubtedly established that the accused had stolen the mobile telephone from the victim ...”
... ”
On 13 May 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), arguing that he had not had a fair trial as he had not been given an opportunity to question E.R.
On 8 December 2011 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 January 2012.
The relevant provision of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000, 28/2001, 41/2001, 55/2001, 76/2010, 85/2010) reads as follows:

...”
“After the questioning of a witness or an expert witness or reading out the records and other submissions, the president of the trial panel shall ask the parties and the victim whether they want anything to be noted.”
The relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 152/2008, 76/2009, 80/2011, 121/2011, 91/2012, 143/2012) provide:
“...

(3)  A request for the reopening of proceedings in connection with a final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights may be lodged within a period of thirty days, starting from the date on which the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights becomes final.”
“...
(2)  If, prior to the entry into force of this Code, a decision has been adopted against which a legal remedy is allowed pursuant to the provisions of the legislation relevant to the proceedings [in which the decision was adopted] ..., the provisions of that legislation shall be applicable [to the proceedings in respect of the remedy], unless otherwise provided under this Code.
(3)  Articles 497-508 of this Code shall be applicable accordingly to requests for the reopening of criminal proceedings made under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002, 143/2002, 62/2003, and 115/2006).”
In its judgment no. I Kž-37/09-6 of 9 September 2009, the Supreme Court dealt with the problem of admitting in evidence the written record of an oral statement by a witness who had been questioned at the pre-trial stage without the defence being provided with the opportunity to be present during the questioning. The Supreme Court noted, in particular:
“The issue in this case is not whether it was impossible to ‘bring the victim to Croatia’, nor is it a problem of the direct questioning of the victim N.M. before the ‘Croatian criminal court’; the issue lies in the fact that, through international legal assistance in criminal matters, the victim N.M. was twice heard as a witness by the Subotica Municipal Court [in Serbia] without informing the defendant D.B. or his defence counsel M.U. that such action (questioning of the victim) was being taken.
... [T]he Supreme Court, as the court of appeal, considers that in such circumstances the accused D.B. did not have an effective opportunity to challenge the witness’s statement, which was decisive evidence for his conviction, and the Supreme Court therefore concludes that he did not have a fair trial as required under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention as regards his right to have a central witness (the victim M.M.) questioned and his right to be present during her questioning irrespective of whether or not he wished to exercise that right.”
