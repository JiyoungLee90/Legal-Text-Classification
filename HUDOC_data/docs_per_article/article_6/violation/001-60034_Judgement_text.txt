The case originated in an application (no. 29911/96) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Hikmet Uygur (“the applicant”), on 11 January 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mrs Semra Dural Esim, a lawyer practising in Muğla (Turkey). The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the length of the criminal proceedings against him.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr Rıza Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr Feyyaz Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge, in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
The President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present application should be joined to other applications against the same respondent State raising the same complaint (applications nos. 28291/95, 29280/95, 26699/96, 29700/96, 29701/96, 29702/96, 29703/96, 29912/96, 29913/96, 31831/96, 31834/96, 31853/96, 31880/96, 31891/96, 31960/96, 32964/96, 32987/96, 32900/96, 33362/96, 33369/96, 33645/96, 34591/96, 34687/96, 39428/96 and 43362/96) (Rule 43 § 2).
By a decision of 31 August 1999, having obtained the parties’ observations, the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Third Section (Rule 52 § 1)
On 19 October 1980 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the THKP-C (Turkish People’s Liberation Party/Front).
On 4 November 1980 the applicant was detained on remand.
On 4 March 1981 the Military Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the İstanbul Martial Law Court against the applicant and 127 other defendants. The Public Prosecutor accused the applicant, inter alia, of membership of an illegal armed organisation, namely the THKP/C, whose object was to undermine the constitutional order and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist regime. He further charged the applicant with having been involved in a number of crimes such as bombing and armed robbery of   private properties, and killing of several individuals at a security directorate.
The prosecution sought the death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.
By decisions of 24 March and 14 and 28 December 1981 the Torba Assize Court (ağır ceza mahkemesi) declined jurisdiction ratione materiae in respect of the criminal proceedings brought before it against the applicant. The court held that the alleged crimes fell within the jurisdiction of the martial courts. The case-files were joined to the case before the İstanbul Martial Law Court.
In a judgment of 8 November 1984 the İstanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of the THKP/C and his involvement in the alleged crimes. It sentenced the applicant to death penalty under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code.
As the applicant’s sentence exceeded 15 years’ imprisonment, his case was automatically referred to the Military Court of Cassation (Askeri Yargıtay).
On 12 April 1988 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court on the ground that the latter failed to establish the guilt of the applicant in some of the alleged crimes. It referred the case to the Istanbul Martial Law Court.
On 17 August 1990 the İstanbul Martial Law Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to lifetime imprisonment, permanently debarred him from employment in the civil service and placed him under judicial guardianship. The applicant appealed.
On 23 August 1991 the İstanbul Martial Law Court ordered the applicant’s release pending trial.
Following promulgation of the Law of 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) acquired jurisdiction over the case and on 4 January 1994 the case file was transmitted to it.
On 18 April 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant’s conviction.
Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code provides:
“Whosoever shall attempt to alter or amend in whole or in part the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey or to effect a coup d’état against the Grand National Assembly formed under the Constitution or to prevent it by force from carrying out its functions shall be liable to the death penalty.”
