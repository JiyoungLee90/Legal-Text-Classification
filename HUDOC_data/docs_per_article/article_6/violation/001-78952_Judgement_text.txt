The case originated in an application (no. 42872/02) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Romanian national, Mr Tiberiu Octavian Cornif (“the applicant”), on 4 December 2002.
The applicant, who had been granted legal aid, was represented by Mr R.V. Oprea, a lawyer practising in . The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr B. Aurescu, who was subsequently replaced by Mrs R. Rizoiu and lastly by Mrs B. Ramaşcanu from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 7 April 2004 the Court (Second Section) decided to communicate the complaints concerning the right to a fair hearing under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and the right to the protection of property under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in .
On 21 May 1999, he signed a contract for services with the National Association of Securities Dealers, a private enterprise (“the Association”).
On 18 July 2000 he notified the Association of his intention to terminate the contract from 5 August 2000, invoking the Association's noncompliance with its contractual obligations.
On 13 November 2000, the applicant lodged with the Bucharest County Court an action against the Association seeking compensation for pecuniary damage caused by the latter's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations.
Before the County Court, the Association asked to have the contract declared null and void on the ground that the procedure for the validation of the contract had not been carried out in conformity with its own statutes, this having as result the fact that the contract was not legally binding on it. The applicant contested this argument.
In a judgment of 7 June 2001, the County Court found the contract to be valid and, based on an expert opinion, awarded the applicant 129,648 US dollars (USD) in compensation, USD 8,330 by way of penalties and 96,413,000 Romanian lei (ROL) for court fees.
According to the applicable law, this judgment was enforceable.
In a final decision of 5 November 2001, the Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal lodged by the Association and confirmed the judgment.
On 22 January 2002, the applicant, who had instituted proceedings for the enforcement of the judgment of 7 June 2001, received ROL 440,000,000 from the Association.
This sum is still in the applicant's possession although proceedings for its recovery have been started by the Association in 2005 and are still pending with the domestic courts.
On 5 December 2001, the ProcuratorGeneral, at the Association's request, lodged an application with the Supreme Court of Justice to have both the judgment of 7 June 2001 and the final decision of 5 November 2001 quashed (“recurs în anulare”) on the ground that the two courts which decided on the case had committed a serious breach of the law when examining the legality of the parties' contract.
On 18 April 2002, the Supreme Court postponed the pronouncement of the final decision until 29 May 2002.
The decision was eventually adopted on 5 June 2002. The Supreme Court allowed the application, quashed the final decision of 5 November 2001 and sent the case back to the Bucharest Court of Appeal for a fresh examination on the merits, on the ground that the two courts had not examined whether the contract was valid and binding on both parties and whether the applicant's initial action could still be allowed in the light of the termination of the contract by the applicant on 5 August 2000.
In an interlocutory judgment of 13 November 2002, the Court of Appeal asked the applicant to supplement the court fees by ROL 18,231,600 which he did on 10 December 2002.
In a final decision of 12 March 2003, the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the Association's appeal, quashed the judgment of 7 June 2001 and dismissed the applicant's action on the ground that while the contract was valid, the conditions for engaging the Association's responsibility for paying damages were not met. It also ordered the applicant to pay the Association ROL 32,109,680 in court fees.
The relevant articles of the Code of Civil Procedure read as follows:
Article 330
“The Procurator-General may, of his own motion or on an application by the Minister of Justice, apply to the Supreme Court of Justice for a final decision to be quashed on any of the following grounds: ...
that the decision in question has seriously infringed the law by giving a wrong solution on the merits of the case, or when the decision is manifestly illfounded; ...”
Article 3301
“The time-limit for lodging an appeal on the grounds provided for by Article 330 § 2 is one year from the date on which the decision became final.”
These provisions have been repealed by Article I § 17 of the Government's Emergency Ordinance no. 58 of 25 June 2003.
