The case originated in two applications (nos. 8747/02 and 34509/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals, Mr Halis Geçgel and Mr Recep Çelik (“the applicants”), on 27 November 2001 and 22 July 2003 respectively.
The applicants were represented by Mr M Beştaş, a lawyer practising in . The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 8 June 2006 and 2 October 2007, respectively, the Court declared the applications partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the Government the complaints concerning a lack of legal assistance to the applicants during their police custody and the length of the criminal proceedings. Furthermore, in respect of application no. 8747/02, the Court communicated the complaint as regards the length of the first applicant's detention on remand and, in respect of application no. 34509/03, the second applicant's complaint raised under Article 6 § 3 (d). It also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicants were born in 1977 and 1965, respectively, and they are both serving prison sentences. The facts common to these cases are that the applicants were arrested and placed in custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, and during their police custody they had no right to legal assistance. Their statements taken during this period were subsequently used for their conviction by the trial courts.
The details concerning the applications are indicated in the table below.
