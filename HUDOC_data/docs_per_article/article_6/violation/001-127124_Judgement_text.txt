On 11 December 2008 the State sold its shares to a private company.
The Enforcement Procedure Act of 2004 (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act of 2000 (“the 2000 Act”). Article 5 § 1 of the 2004 Act provides that all enforcement proceedings are to be conducted urgently. In accordance with Article 12 § 5 of this Act an appeal against an enforcement order, in principle, does not postpone the enforcement. In accordance with Article 304 of the 2004 Act, all enforcement proceedings instituted prior to 23 February 2005 are to be carried out pursuant to the previous 2000 Act.
This Acts regulates the manner and conditions for initiating and conducting insolvency proceedings against legal persons. Article 2 of this Act provides that the aim of insolvency shall be to ensure the most favourable collective settlement of creditors. Article 8 of this Act states that all insolvency proceedings are to be conducted urgently. In accordance with Articles 19 § 1 and Article 22 § 1, in insolvency proceedings against socially/State-owned companies the role of the insolvency administrator is to be performed by the Privatisation Agency. Article 93 §§ 1 and 2 provides that “as of the day of institution of the insolvency proceedings” the debtor cannot simultaneously be subjected to a separate enforcement procedure. Any ongoing enforcement proceedings shall thus be stayed, while new enforcement proceedings cannot be instituted for as long as the insolvency proceedings are pending.
These provisions are set out in the case of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia (nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, 15 January 2008, §§ 71-76).
The relevant provisions of the Act are set out in the case of Milunović and Čekrlić v. Serbia (dec.), nos. 3716/09 and 38051/09, §§ 3539, 17 May 2011). In addition, on 17 December 2012, amendments to this Act have been published in OG RS no. 119/12 according to which the deadline for the suspension of enforcements in respect of companies undergoing restructuring has been extended to 30 June 2014, at the latest.
