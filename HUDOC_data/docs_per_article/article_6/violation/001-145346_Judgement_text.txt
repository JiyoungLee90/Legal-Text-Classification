The case originated in an application (no. 7194/12) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ms Radmila Mišković (“the applicant”), on 24 December 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr Đ. Marić, a lawyer practising in Banja Luka. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
The case is, like Čolić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009 and Runić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 28735/06 et al., 5 November 2011, about the non-enforcement of a final and enforceable domestic judgment awarding war damages to the applicant.
On 14 March 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By a judgment of the Prijedor Court of First Instance of 24 November 2000 which became final on 12 January 2001, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, 7,000 convertible marks (BAM) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BAM 600 in respect of pecuniary damage together with default interest at the statutory rate to the applicant.
The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 24 August 2001.
The applicant complained of non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”). On 20 December 2005 the Constitutional Court found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. The applicant did not claim compensation, but even if she had done so, her claim would most likely have been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, §195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, §79; AP 224/08 of 8 December 2010, §37).
After the extensive information campaign explaining the available options for the settlement of the Republika Srpska’s public debt (including its debt arising from domestic judgments), on 25 April 2012 the applicant informed the authorities that she agreed to be paid the principal debt and default interest in bonds. Government bonds were then issued to the applicant on 31 May 2012. On 17 September 2012 the applicant sold all of her bonds on the Stock Exchange.
The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Čolić and Others (cited above, § 10-12) and Runić and Others (cited above, § 11).
