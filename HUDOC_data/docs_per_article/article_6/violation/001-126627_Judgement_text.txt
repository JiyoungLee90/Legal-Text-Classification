The case originated in an application (no. 3129/04) against the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Macedonian national, Mr Radoslav Dimitrijoski (“the applicant”), on 7 November 2003.
The Macedonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs R. Lazareska Gerovska.
On 24 October 2007 the President of the Fifth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government.
On 1 February 2011 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). The case was assigned to the newly composed First Section (Rule 52 § 1). In accordance with Protocol no. 14, the application was allocated to a Committee of three Judges. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 28 § 1 b).
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Prilep.
On 14 January 1998 the applicant lodged a civil action against the State claiming compensation for alleged failure of the domestic courts to decide his appeal in other proceedings in which he had sought reopening of a criminal case against him. During the proceedings, the applicant specified his claim on several occasions.
On 3 June 1999 the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) dismissed the applicant’s claim. On 26 January 2000 the Skopje Court of Appeal confirmed that decision. On 14 November 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s appeal on points of law and remitted the case for re-examination.
Between 27 February 2003 and 5 July 2005 the first-instance court ordered ten adjournments, of which two were requested by the applicant.
On 5 July 2005 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim. On 28 December 2005 the Skopje Court of Appeal quashed that decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration.
On 14 April 2006 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim. On 24 November 2006 and 28 May 2008, respectively, the Skopje Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court confirmed that decision.
