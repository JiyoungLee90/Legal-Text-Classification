The case originated in an application (no. 4629/07) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Yelena Vasilyevna Belova (“the applicant”), on 25 December 2006.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 14 January 2009 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Moscow.
On 11 January 1999 the parish of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Dormition of the Theotokos (the “Parish”) brought a civil claim against the applicant and her family claiming title to the land plot de facto used by the latter.
In May 1999 the applicant brought a counterclaim seeking annulment of the Parish’s title to the land plot.
On 23 November 1999 the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow granted the Parish’s claim and dismissed the counterclaim lodged by the applicant.
On 18 February 2000 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 23 November 1999 on appeal.
In July 2000 the city prosecutor’s office, upon the applicant’s request, asked for the supervisory review of the above judgments.
On 24 August 2000 the Presidium of the Moscow City Court quashed the judgments of 23 November 1999 and 18 February 2000 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.
It appears that both parties amended their claims in part for several times. The applicant eventually sought recognition of her property title to the land plot in question.
On 4 May 2005 the District Court granted the applicant’s claims in full. The Parish appealed.
On 11 August 2005 the City Court upheld the judgment of 4 May 2005 on appeal.
It appears the judgment of 4 May 2005 was not enforced.
On 25 December 2005 the Parish asked for the supervisory review of the judgments in the applicant’s favour.
On 13 July 2006 the Presidium of the City Court quashed the judgments of 4 May and 11 August 2005 by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration.
On 31 January 2007 the proceedings discontinued due to the absence of the parties.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
