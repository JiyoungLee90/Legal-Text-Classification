The case originated in an application (no. 44319/11) against Hungary, lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Hungarian nationals, Mr Attila Lázár and Mrs Attiláné Lázár (“the applicants”), on 18 July 2011.
The applicants were represented by Mr T. Fazekas, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Justice.
On 4 March 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicants were born in 1948 and live in Budapest.
The applicants have had a long-lasting legal dispute with a housing cooperative and two individuals in respect of ownership right to a real property. The applicants’ several claims for title were dismissed by the competent courts.
The applicants lodged an action in damages against the housing cooperative and the two individuals on 15 October 2002.
The procedure was suspended on 17 December 2004 for eighteen months due to other pending proceedings before the land registry authority.
Subsequently, after several hearings, the first-instance court partly found for the applicants on 9 March 2010.
On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the applicants’ claim on 30 November 2010.
