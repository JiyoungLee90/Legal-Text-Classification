The case originated in an application (no. 47388/06) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Nikolay Ivanovich Samarov (“the applicant”), on 31 October 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. O. Tryasuchkin, a lawyer practising in Penza. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 11 May 2010 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Penza.
The applicant sued the Penza town administration and the Penza committee for municipal property management (“the property management committee”), seeking to obtain free of charge the title to a plot of land under the office building he owned.
On 16 November 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of Penza (“the District Court”) held for the applicant and ordered the town administration to establish his title to the land at issue. The judgment was not appealed against and became final within the statutory ten-day time-limit.
On 7 March 2006 the Penza town administration lodged an application for supervisory review.
On 19 June 2006 the Presidium of the Penza Regional Court quashed the judgment of 16 November 2005, considering that the District Court had incorrectly established the facts of the case and erroneously applied the domestic material law. It consequently remitted the case to the District Court for consideration anew.
On 10 August 2006 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim in full. The applicant did not appeal and the judgment became final within the statutory ten-day time-limit.
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure at the material time is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
