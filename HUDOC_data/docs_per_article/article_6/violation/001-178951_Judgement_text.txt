The case originated in an application (no. 58661/09) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Murat Üçel (“the applicant”), on 22 October 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr F. Okan, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the complaints concerning the alleged unfairness of the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the alleged independence and impartiality of the tribunal because of the presence of two military officers sitting on the bench who did not enjoy the same judicial guarantees as the other military judges, were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Denizli.
On 13 June 2009 the applicant was dismissed from the Expert Gendarmerie School due to non-compliance with disciplinary rules. Subsequently, he initiated proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the dismissal decision.
.  On 15 April 2009 the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request, taking into account the “secret documents” submitted by the Ministry of Defence. These documents were not disclosed to the applicant. This decision was served on the applicant on 7 May 2009.
