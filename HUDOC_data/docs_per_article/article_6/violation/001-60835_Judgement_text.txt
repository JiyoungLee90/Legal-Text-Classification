The case originated in an application (no. 30883/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Italian national, Mrs Paola Esposito (“the applicant”), on 22  November 1995.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Cenerini, a lawyer practising in Leghorn. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that she had been unable to recover possession of her flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, she further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Mr G. Raimondi as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 30 May 2000 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Leghorn.
The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Leghorn, which she had let to O.C.L.
On an unidentified date, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date.
In a writ served on the tenant on 16 July 1991 the applicant reiterated her intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Leghorn Magistrate.
By a decision of 29 July 1991, which was made enforceable on 17 September 1991, the Leghorn Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1992.
On 29 March 1993, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 15 May 1993, the applicant made a statutory declaration that she urgently required the premises as accommodation for herself.
On 20 May 1993, she served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 17 June 1993.
Between 17 June 1993 and 4 June 1998, the bailiff made eight attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession.
Following the entry into force of Law No. 431 of 1998, on 27 July 1999, the tenant asked the Leghorn District Court to set a fresh date for the enforcement of the order for possession.
The applicant asked the court to reject the tenant's request.
On 23 September 1999, the Leghorn Magistrate decided to postpone the enforcement proceedings until 10 February 2001. In the meantime, pursuant to Law No. 388/00 all evictions of tenants were suspended until 30  June 2001.
On 2 July 2001, the applicant served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 20 July 2001.
On 3 August 2001, the Leghorn Magistrate decided to postpone the enforcement proceedings first until 23 April 2002 and then until 16 May 2002.
On 23 May 2002, the applicant was granted police assistance to evict the tenant only once, but to no avail, as the tenant claimed he was ill and an officially assigned doctor was available to check his allegations.
On 24 May 2002 the applicant had not recovered possession of her flat.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
