The case originated in an application (no. 13210/05) against  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Montenegrin national, Mr Miladin Novović (“the applicant”), on 2 April 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. Mirović, a lawyer practising in Bar. The Montenegrin Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Z. Pažin.
The applicant complained, in particular, about the length of reinstatement proceedings.
On 28 June 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Sutomore.
On 25 June 1991 the applicant was made redundant.
On 29 June 1991 and on 2 December 1993 the applicant filed two claims seeking reinstatement and compensation, one against his former employer, and one against the institution which, in the meantime, had taken over the functions from his former employer (Republički zavod za geodetske i imovinskopravne poslove; hereinafter “the Institution”).
On 28 February 1994 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Bar ruled against the applicant upon his claim against the Institution.
On 27 May 1994 the High Court (Viši sud) in Podgorica overturned this judgment and ruled in favour of the applicant.
On 9 November 1994 the two sets of proceedings were joined into a single lawsuit. On the same day the Court of First Instance in Bar ruled in respect of the claim against the former employer, awarding the applicant damages. This judgment became final (pravosnažna) in January 1995. The proceedings against the Institution continued.
On 30 May 1995 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud) in Podgorica quashed the two judgments rendered in respect of the Institution (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above) and ordered a re-trial.
It would appear that on 8 December 1999 the Court of First Instance in Bar rendered a decision that the applicant’s claim had been withdrawn (tužba povučena), which decision was apparently quashed by the High Court in Podgorica on 16 May 2000.
On 27 February 2006 the Court of First Instance in Bar ruled against the applicant.
On 4 November 2008 the High Court in Podgorica upheld this judgment.
On 16 June 2009 the Supreme Court in Podgorica dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law (revizija).
Article 149 of the Constitution provides that the Constitutional Court shall rule on a constitutional appeal lodged in respect of an alleged violation of a human right or freedom guaranteed by the Constitution, after all other effective legal remedies have been exhausted.
This Constitution entered into force on 22 October 2007.
Section 48 provides that a constitutional appeal may be lodged against an individual decision of a state body, an administrative body, a local self-government body or a legal person exercising public authority, for violations of human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, after all other effective domestic remedies have been exhausted.
Sections 49-59 provide additional details as regards the processing of constitutional appeals. In particular, section 56 provides that when the  finds a violation of a human right or freedom, it shall quash the impugned decision, entirely or partially, and order that the case be re-examined by the same body which rendered the quashed decision.
This Act entered into force on 4 November 2008.
This Act provides, under certain circumstances, the possibility to have lengthy proceedings expedited by means of a request for review (kontrolni zahtjev), as well as an opportunity for claimants to be awarded compensation by means of an action for fair redress (tužba za pravično zadovoljenje).
Section 33 § 3 provides, inter alia, that an action for fair redress shall be filed with the Supreme Court no later than six months after the date of receipt of the final decision rendered in the impugned proceedings.
Section 44, in particular, provides that this Act shall be applied retroactively to all proceedings from 3 March 2004, but that the duration of proceedings before that date shall also be taken into account.
This Act entered into force on 21 December 2007, but contained no reference to applications involving procedural delay already lodged with the Court.
Section 434 provided that labour disputes were to be dealt with by the courts urgently.
This Act entered into force on 10 July 2004 and thereby repealed the Civil Procedure Act 1977.
The text of section 434 of the Civil Procedure Act 2004 corresponds to section 434 of the Civil Procedure Act 1977.
Between 1 January 2008 and 30 September 2009 twenty-two actions for fair redress were submitted, of which sixteen were dealt with and six were still being examined. In one case the courts awarded the plaintiff compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the length of civil proceedings. Between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2011 an additional fifteen actions for fair redress were examined, in three of which the courts awarded damages.
