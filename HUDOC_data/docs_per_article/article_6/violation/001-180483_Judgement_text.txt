The case originated in an application (no. 15069/05) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Osman Aymelek (“the applicant”), on 25 February 2005.
The applicant was represented by Mr M. S. Liman, lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 11 February 2016 the complaints concerning the independence and the impartiality of the General Staff Military Court, and the lack of legal assistance during the preliminary investigation were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it (see Yivli v. Turkey, no. 12723/11, 14 November 2017).
The applicant was born in 1960.
At the time of the events the applicant was serving in the Turkish Army as a lieutenant-colonel.
On 8 May, 10 May and 11 May 2000, the applicant was interrogated by the military prosecutor within the context of a criminal investigation initiated against him for embezzlement.
On 16 June 2000 an arrest warrant was issued in respect of the applicant on suspicion of embezzlement.
19 June 2000 the applicant applied to the Military Prosecutor’s Office. He was placed in detention on remand on the same day by the General Staff Military Court.
On the same day, the applicant gave a power of attorney to a lawyer.
On 22 June 2000 the applicant’s brother Şükrü Aymelek, who was a lawyer, was also placed in detention on remand. On 10 April 2012 the applicant’s brother was released.
On 26 June 2000 the General Staff Military Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the General Staff Military Court charging the applicant with embezzlement under Section 131 of Military Criminal Code, involving in trade activities as a soldier under Additional Section 1 of Military Criminal Code and breaching Article 13 of the Law No. 3628 (Law on Disclosure of Assets and Fight Against Bribery and Corruption). The siblings of the applicant, Şükrü Aymelek and Ulviye Toprakkıran were also charged with the same bill of indictment with embezzlement and breaching Article 13 of the Law No. 3628.
On 29 May 2001 the General Staff Military Prosecutor filed an additional bill of indictment and charged the accused with additional acts related to the crimes already stated in the first bill of indictment.
On 19 September 2001, the applicant submitted a petition with the prison authorities, complaining that he had not been able to see his brother Şükrü Aymelek, who was also detained in remand. The applicant stated that he regretted that his brother was also in prison because of him, and requested to see him.
On 19 September 2002 the applicant was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for embezzlement and being involved in trade activities as a soldier by the General Staff Military Court, composed of a military officer with no legal background and two military judges.
On 6 January 2003 the applicant appealed against the decision of the General Staff Military Court.
On 2 April 2003 the Military Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of 19 September 2002 on procedural grounds and on the merits.
On 17 December 2003 the General Staff Military Court found the applicant guilty for embezzlement and being involved in trade activities as a soldier, but reduced his prison sentence. The applicant appealed.
On 2 June 2004 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the decision of 17 December 2003.
On 13 January 2014 the applicant requested from the Military Court of Cassation to reopen the criminal proceedings alleging that a witness who had not been heard, was ready to give statements before the court. The applicant submitted that witness’ written statements to the Military Court of Cassation as well.
On 19 February 2014 rejected the applicant’s request for reopening of the criminal proceedings, on the grounds that the witness’ statements did not have any evidential value, which could warrant a lesser sentence or the acquittal of the applicant.
A description of the relevant domestic law concerning the composition and functioning of military courts at the material time may be found in Gürkan v. Turkey (no. 10987/10, §§ 7-8, 3 July 2012).
Sections 83 and 85(1) of the Act Governing the Formation and Proceedings of Martial Law Courts (Law no. 353), which was in force at the time, provided as follows:
Section 83
“At the beginning of the interrogation, the accused shall be informed of the charges against him.
In the course of the interrogation the accused must not be prevented from bringing forward any evidence in his favour.
In the first interrogation, the identity and personal status of the accused shall be determined.
In cases where a person is accused of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty, he shall be interrogated by the military public prosecutor even if his statements had been taken previously.”
Section 85 (1)
“The accused shall have access to legal assistance of one or more lawyers at any stage of the investigation.”
Following a referendum held on 16 April 2017, Law no. 6771 was adopted; Articles 145 and 157 of the Constitution were repealed and the following paragraph was added to Article 142 of the Constitution:
“... No military courts shall be formed other than disciplinary courts. However, in a state of war, military courts may be formed with jurisdiction to try offences committed by military personnel in relation to their duties.”
