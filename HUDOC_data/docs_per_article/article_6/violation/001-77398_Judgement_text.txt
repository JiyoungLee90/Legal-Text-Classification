The background facts for the case are described in the case of Anatskiy v. Ukraine (no. 10558/03, §§ 5-8, 13 December 2005). The circumstances of the present case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 11 January 2000 the Company's labour disputes commission (“the Commission,” комісія з трудових спорів ВАТ “Південелектромаш“) ordered the Company to pay the applicant UAH 1,519 in salary arrears.

On 26 June 2002 the Bailiffs returned the execution writs in respect of the judgment of 10 January 2002 to the applicant unenforced. They stated that the judgment could not be enforced for the debtor's lack of funds. They further advised the applicant of his right to resubmit these writs at any time, but until 26 July 2005.
