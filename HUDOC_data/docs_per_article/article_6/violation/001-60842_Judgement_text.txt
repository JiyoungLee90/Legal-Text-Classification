The case originated in an application (no. 32662/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Geni Srl (“the applicant”), an Italian company, on 26 July 1996.
The applicant was represented by Mrs C. M. Cialdini, a lawyer practising in Rome. The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito.
The applicant complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that it had been unable to recover possession of its flat within a reasonable time. Invoking Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, it further complained about the length of the eviction proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of Italy, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government appointed Mr G. Raimondi as ad hoc judge to sit in his place (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 2).
On 22 March 2001 the Court declared the application admissible.
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed First Section.
The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Rome, which it had let to L.L.D.L.
In a registered letter of 20 November 1984, the applicant informed the tenant that it intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1986 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date.
On 5 June 1986, it served a notice to quit on the tenant, but she refused to leave.
In a writ served on the tenant on 12 June 1986, the applicant reiterated its intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Rome Magistrate.
By a decision of 30 June 1986, which was made enforceable on 20 November 1986, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1987.
On 17 March 1990, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises.
On 9 June 1990 it served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 15 June 1990.
Between 15 June 1990 and 25 September 1996 the bailiff made thirty-two attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as, under the statutory provisions providing for the staggering of evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession.
On 6 May 1997, the applicant sold the apartment.
The relevant domestic law is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.
