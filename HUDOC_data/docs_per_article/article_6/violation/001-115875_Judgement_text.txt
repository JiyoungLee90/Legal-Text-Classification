The case originated in four applications (nos. 6179/08, 12453/10, 17809/10 and 17208/11) against Bosnia and Herzegovina lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by 16 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Nenad Ignjatić, Ms Marija Ignjatić, Ms Biljana Ignjatić, Ms Ivana Ignjatić, Mr Duško Škorić, Ms Đuja Škorić, Mr Dejan Škorić, Ms Danijela Škorić, Mr Đuro Marić, Ms Gospana Marić, Ms Stana Marić, Ms Olivera Marić, Mr Savo Ostojić, Ms Zora Ostojić, Mr Bojan Ostojić and Ms Tanja Ostojić (“the applicants”), between 22 January 2008 27 January 2011.
The Ignjatićs and the Ostojićs were represented by Ms Radmila Plavšić and Mr Ranko Vulić, lawyers practising in . The Škorićs and the Marićs were represented by Mr Đorđe Marić, a lawyer practising in . The Government of Bosnia and  (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Mijić.
This case is, like Čolić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 1218/07 et al., 10 November 2009, and Runić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 28735/06 et al., 15 November 2011, about the non-enforcement of final and enforceable domestic judgments awarding war damages to the applicants.
On 30 August 2010 (application no. 6179/08) and on 4 July 2011 (applications nos. 12453/10, 17809/10 and 17208/11) the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time (Article 29 § 1).
The applicants live in .
By four judgments of the Banja Luka Court of First Instance of 22 July 1999, 29 January 2002 (application no. 12453/10), 29 January 2002 (application no. 17809/10) and 31 October 2002, which became final on 5 January 2001, 12 January 2005, 22 November 2004 and 26 January 2005, respectively, the Republika Srpska (an Entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina) was ordered to pay, within 15 days, the following amounts in convertible marks (BAM) in respect of war damage together with default interest at the statutory rate:
(i)  BAM 26,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the Ignjatićs;
(ii)  BAM 42,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and BAM 1,998 in respect of legal costs to the Škorićs;
(iii)  BAM 47,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the Marićs;
(iv)  BAM 29,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the Ostojićs.
The Banja Luka Court of First Instance issued writs of execution (rješenje o izvršenju) on 20 April 2001, 8 September 2003, 19 April 2005, 14 April 2005 and 5 April 2006, respectively.
The applicants complained of non-enforcement to the Human Rights Chamber or to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 8 March 2006 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the case of the Ignjatićs. On 20 December 2005 the  ruled likewise in the case of the Škorićs and the Marićs. The applicants did not claim compensation, but even if they had done so, their claim would have most likely been refused (see, for example, the Constitutional Court’s decisions AP 774/04 of 20 December 2005, § 438; AP 557/05 of 12 April 2006, § 195; AP 1211/06 of 13 December 2007, § 79; and AP 244/08 of 8 December 2010, § 37).On 15 April 2009 the Constitutional Court dismissed the case of the Ostojićs due to the change of circumstances following amendments to the Domestic Debt Act 2004.
On 16 June 2010, 26 November 2009 and 14 October 2009, respectively, the Banja Luka Court of First Instance accepted the debtor’s appeals in the cases of the Škorićs, the Marićs and the Ostojićs and altered its previous writs of executions: it ordered that only the legal costs were to be paid in cash, while the principal debt and default interest were to be paid in government bonds.
It would appear that legal costs were paid to the Škorićs and the Marićs.
The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Čolić and Others (cited above, §§ 10-12) and Runić and Others (cited above, § 11). It should be noted that on 8 June 2011 the  found a breach of Article 6 of the Convention in the case in which, like in the cases of the Škorićs, the Marićs and the Ostojićs (see paragraph 9), the court in the enforcement proceedings ordered that the judgment debt was to be paid in government bonds. The  ordered the Republika Srpska to pay the judgment debt in cash without further delay (see decision
On 13 January 2012 the Domestic Debt Act 2012 entered into force, thereby repealing the Domestic Debt Act 2004. As regards the payment of war damage, it envisages the same solution as the old Act, with the change in the maturity of government bonds which is now 13 years instead of 14 years. The new Act is, however, irrelevant for the present case since the applicants did not accept issuance of bonds in lieu of cash as means of enforcement.
