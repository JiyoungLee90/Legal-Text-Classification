The case originated in an application (no. 10823/06) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Ms Natalia Bondarenco (“the applicant”), on 3 March 2006.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Bivol, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Grosu.
On 1 September 2008 the application was communicated to the Government.
On 2 February 2009 the Government submitted observations on the admissibility and merits. The applicant did not submit any observations within the imparted time-limit.
On 17 June 2014 the Court informed the Government that since the application was already subject of well-established case-law of the Court it was decided to assign it to a Committee of three judges.
The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Chișinău.
In 1989 the Chişinău Local Council let an apartment to the applicant. In 2000 the Local Council declared the building in which the applicant had been renting the apartment to be under threat of collapse and on an unspecified date it was demolished. The applicant brought an action against the Chişinău Local Council seeking the allocation of an apartment in lieu of the old one.
By a final judgment of 18 March 2003 the Rîşcani District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the Chişinău Local Council to provide her with an apartment.
Between 2003 and 2004 she lodged numerous complaints about the failure to enforce the judgment in her favour to no avail. The judgment of 18 March 2003 of the Rîşcani District Court has not been enforced to date.
Law no. 87, which created a new remedy to address complaints of non-enforcement of final judgments, entered into force on 1 July 2011. Further details of the Law are set out in this Court’s decision in Balan v. Moldova (dec.), no. 44746/08, 24 January 2012.
