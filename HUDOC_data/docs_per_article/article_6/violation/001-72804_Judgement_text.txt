The case originated in eight applications (nos. 3417/02, 5994/02, 28365/02, 5742/03, 8693/03, 31976/03, 13681/03 and 32759/03) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) eight Moldovan nationals, Mr Valeriu Lupăcescu, Mrs Tatiana Roşcina, Mrs Galina Gaşpar, Mr Petru Popovici, Mr Valeriu Purice, Mr Timofei Simionel, Mr Igor Cojuhari and Mr Alexandru Cebanenco (“the applicants”), on the dates listed in the attached Appendix.
The applicants were represented by “Lawyers for Human Rights” (LHR) and the “Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Moldova” (HCHRM), non-governmental organisations based in Chişinău, as well as Mr A. Beruciaşvili, a lawyer practicing in Chişinău (see details in the attached Appendix). The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicants complained that the late enforcement of the judgments in their favour violated their right to a court guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and their right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention.
The applications were allocated to the Fourth Section. On the dates listed in the Appendix a Chamber of that Section decided to communicate the applications to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
On 28 February 2005 the Chamber decided to join the applications in accordance with Rule 42 (1) of the Rules of the Court.
The personal details of the applicants are listed in the attached Appendix.
Each of the applicants obtained a final judgment against a State authority, ordering the payment of specific sums of money (the dates of the judgments are listed in the attached Appendix). The judgments were not enforced during the following periods of time:
– in the case of Mr Valeriu Lupăcescu, between 5 November 1997 and 19 December 2003 and between 31 January 2001 and 13 February 2004;
– in the case of Mrs Tatiana Roşcina, between 5 May 2000 and 18 December 2003;
– in the case of Mrs Galina Gaşpar, between 5 February 2002 and 2 March 2004;
– in the case of Mr Petru Popovici, between 27 June 2002 and 14 July 2003;
– in the case of Mr Valeriu Purice, between 23 June 1998, 24 December 2001, 27 February 2002, 29 April 2002, 18 July 2002, 19 July 2002 and 26 and 29 November 2003;
– in the case of Mr Timofei Simionel, between 5 June 2001 and 22 December 2003;
– in the case of Mr Igor Cojuhari, between 1 August 1997 and 18 December 2003;
– in the case of Mr Alexandru Cebanenco, between 15 August 2002 and 10 March 2005.
While all judgments have now been enforced, Mr Purice’s final judgment has only been partly enforced (see paragraph 32 below and Appendix attached).
The relevant domestic law has been set out in this Court’s judgment in the case of Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)) and Popov v. Moldova (no. 74153/01, §§ 29-41, 18 January 2005).
