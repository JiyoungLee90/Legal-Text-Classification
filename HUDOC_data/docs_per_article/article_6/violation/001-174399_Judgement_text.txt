The case originated in an application (no. 53802/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Mehmet Tunç (“the applicant”), on 11 July 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr O. Çelen, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 22 September 2015 the applicant’s complaints concerning the lack of fairness in the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on account of his inability to have access to the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence to that court in course of the judicial proceedings and the alleged lack of independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Ankara.
.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 13 April 2010 the applicant was dismissed from his post as an officer in the army due to non-compliance with disciplinary rules.
On 16 May 2010 the applicant brought an action before the Supreme Military Administrative Court and requested the annulment of his dismissal. On 21 October 2010 the chief public prosecutor submitted his observations to the Supreme Military Administrative Court. These observations were notified to the applicant and he replied to it in his petition of 24 January 2011.
On 15 February 2011 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s action having regard to the “secret documents” submitted by the Ministry of Defence. These documents were not disclosed to the applicant.
On 3 May 2011 the applicant’s request for rectification of the above judgment was rejected by the same court.
