On 11 May 1995 the Fier Commission recognised the applicant’s and other heirs’ inherited property rights over a plot of land measuring 55,200 sq. m of which 8,186 sq. m were restored. It also decided that the Commission would decide on the compensation of the remaining plot at a further moment. On 29 January 1999 the Fier District Court amended the Commission decision of 11 May 1995 and restored the applicant and other heirs a plot measuring 9,107 sq. m.
On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a civil action seeking the vacation of the property, which was occupied by third parties.

Since the plot of land was occupied, the Supreme Court decided that the applicant would be compensated in one of the ways provided by law.

He submitted an English translation of a notarised document, which recognised him as the sole testamentary heir in respect of the property situated in Elbasan. The original document, no copy of which was submitted to the Court, appears to have been issued by a notary of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That document has not been recognised by the Albanian authorities in accordance with the Albanian law.
