The case originated in an application (no. 30013/96) against the Republic of Finland lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish bank, Türkiye İş Bankasi (“the applicant”), on 6 November 1995.
The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr O. Akinci and Mr A.N. Ortan, lawyers practising in Istanbul, Turkey. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mr H. Rotkirch, Director-General for Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr A. Kosonen, Director, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that the civil proceedings in the applicant's case had been unreasonably lengthy as they had lasted five and a half years and the Court of Appeal of Helsinki had needed four years to render its decision.
On 15 January 1998 the Commission made a partial decision as to the admissibility of the application, deciding to adjourn the examination of the complaint concerning the length of proceedings and declaring the rest of the application inadmissible.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court.
On 16 November 2000 having obtained the parties' observations on the admissibility and merits of the case, the Chamber declared the application admissible.
On 17 November 2000 the Section Registrar suggested to the parties that they should attempt to reach a friendly settlement within the meaning of Article 38 § 1 (b) of the Convention. On 8 August 2001, after an exchange of correspondence, he noted that there appeared to be no basis for reaching a friendly settlement.
The Chamber decided, after having consulted the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 2 in fine).
On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section.
On 17 August 1977 the applicant issued a letter of guarantee of 5,017,000 US Dollars (USD) to a Turkish company called TEK on behalf of a Finnish co-operative society called Metex. A Finnish bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), issued a counter-guarantee in favour of the applicant.
On 28 April 1988, the City Court (raastuvanoikeus, rådstuvurätt) of Helsinki ordered KOP not to make any payments under the counter-guarantee for the bank guarantee in question.
On 29 September 1988 arbitration proceedings between Metex and TEK were initiated in Zurich, Switzerland, concerning a breach of the original delivery contract. The arbitration award was given on 7 March 1992.
On 15 November 1988 TEK made a call under the guarantee, as Metex had not fulfilled its contractual obligations. The same day the applicant transferred to TEK the sum of USD 1,661,164 on behalf of Metex under the guarantee, and informed its counterpart bank in Finland (KOP) about the operation.
On 18 November 1988 the Finnish bank informed the applicant that the counter-guarantee had expired on 18 August 1987 and that there was an injunction preventing payment.
On 1 December 1989 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against KOP before the City Court of Helsinki, claiming payment under the counter-guarantee. The case began on 4 December 1989 when the writ of summons was served on the respondent (KOP). Metex intervened in the proceedings as a third party. Later, the applicant brought a further action which was served upon the respondent on 18 May 1990.
The City Court of Helsinki decided to apply Turkish law and appointed an expert. There were four oral hearings held before the City Court. It found in favour of the applicant on 22 November 1990, basing its judgment on the expert opinion. The court held that the applicant had made the payment specified in the action and shown that it was entitled to the amounts claimed. As the agreement had not been shown to be unreasonable, the City Court ordered KOP to pay the applicant the required amount of USD 1,661,164.
On 27 December 1990 KOP and Metex appealed against the decision to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätt) of Helsinki.
The reporting officer of the Court of Appeal was assigned to the case on 20 February 1992.
The case was examined by the Court of Appeal, without an oral hearing, on the basis of written observations submitted by the parties. In the proceedings before the Court of Appeal, the applicant submitted its observations on 10 January 1991, further observations on 19 February 1991, a rejoinder to further observations on 15 October 1992, a further rejoinder to further observations of Metex on 16 March 1994, and a request to expedite the proceedings on 16 December 1994. Metex submitted a request to expedite the proceedings on 9 January 1991, its notice of further observations on 30 May and 2 October 1991, further observations and evidence on 29 November 1991, 21 January 1992, 23 April 1992, 18 June 1992 and 5 November 1992. Metex also submitted a rejoinder to the rejoinder of the applicant on 16 March 1994, further observations on 15 and 18 April 1994 and a translation of its observations on 18 May 1994. KOP submitted further observations on 26 June 1992 and a rejoinder to the said rejoinder of the applicant on 16 March 1994.
The case was finally brought before a Chamber of the Court of Appeal on 16 December 1993.
In a judgment of 30 November 1994 the Court of Appeal set aside the City Court's judgment, finding that the applicant should, prior to making the payment, have confirmed that it was obliged to make payment under the guarantee and that the TEK's claim was not to be considered fraudulent or an abuse of rights. The court found that the applicant had not shown that it had fulfilled its obligations in that respect.
The applicant sought leave to appeal from the Supreme Court, (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) which, on 17 May 1995, refused the applicant leave to appeal.
