The case originated in an application (no. 17252/04) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Slovak national, Mr Peter Gerstbrein (“the applicant”), on 7 May 2004.
The applicant was represented by Mr R. Belanský, a lawyer practising in Košice. The Slovak Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková.
On 2 April 2008 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Košice.
He was the successful plaintiff in civil proceedings for payment against an individual which ended with a judgment of the Košice II District Court of 6 August 1998.
On 3 February 1999 enforcement proceedings were brought against the applicant’s debtor (file no. Ex 4/99).
The debtor submitted his objections to the enforcement and its costs to the executions officer. On 24 March 1999 the latter transferred the objections to the District Court for decision (file no. Er 85/99). The objections were dismissed on 16 September 2003.
On 6 August 2003 the applicant complained to the  about delays in the proceedings pending under file no. Er 85/99. On 5 November 2003 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s right under Article 48 § 2 of the Constitution to a hearing without unjustified delay, awarded him SKK 25,000 (equivalent to 604 euros (EUR) at that time) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and ordered reimbursement of his legal costs. It did not order the District Court to proceed without further delay on the ground that a decision on the debtor’s objections had already been taken.
On 13 April 2005 the executions officer returned his authorisation for enforcement to the District Court with the applicant’s consent, as the debtor had no property with which he could satisfy the applicant’s claim. The enforcement proceedings thus ended.
