The case originated in an application (no. 48966/09) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mives DOO, a limited liability company based in Serbia (“the applicant”), on 31 August 2009.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Simić, a lawyer practising in Novi Sad. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, being more recently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 23 October 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
On 24 April 1997 and 3 September 1998 respectively, the Pančevo Commercial Court ordered DD Lola Utva Vazduhoplovna industrija, a socially-owned company based in Pančevo (hereinafter “the debtor”) to pay the applicant specified amounts on account of damages for the airplane it bought from the debtor, but which had never been delivered to the applicant, plus the costs of the civil proceedings. These judgments became final by 4 June 1998 and 25 September 1998 respectively.
On 5 June 2002, upon the applicant’s request to that effect, the Pančevo Commercial Court ordered the enforcement of the said judgments and further ordered the debtor to pay the applicant the enforcement costs.
On 11 February 2008 the Commercial Court noted that on 29 January 2008 the Privatisation Agency had ordered the restructuring of the debtor and stayed the enforcement proceedings until the conclusion of this process.
According to the information on the status of the debtor obtained from the website of the Serbian Business Registers Agency, the debtor is an active company, predominantly comprised of State-owned capital (see , accessed on 24 October 2016).
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned companies, as well as enforcement and insolvency proceedings, has been outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008, and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013. Furthermore, the case-law of the Constitutional Court in respect of socially-owned companies, together with the relevant provisions concerning constitutional redress has likewise been outlined in the admissibility decision in Marinković v. Serbia (dec.), no. 5353/11, §§ 26 -29 and 31-44, 29 January 2013, the judgment in Marinković v. Serbia, no. 5353/11, §§ 29-31, 22 October 2013, and the decision in Ferizović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 65713/13, §§ 12-17, 26 November 2013.
