The applicant was represented by Mr M. A. Erol, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.
On 21 October 1998 the European Commission of Human Rights declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention relating to the length of the criminal proceedings.
The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11).
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.
In a letter of 1 April 2003, the Court informed the parties that in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1).
On 1 November 2004 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).
On 7 June 2005 the Court decided to invite the parties to submit further written observations on the admissibility and merits of the applicant’s complaint that the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments.
On 25 December 1996 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and upheld the judgment of the firstinstance court. The decision of the Court of Cassation was sent to the registry of the first-instance court on 31 January 1997.
