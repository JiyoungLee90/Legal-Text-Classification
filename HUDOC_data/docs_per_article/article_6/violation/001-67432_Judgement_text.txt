The case originated in an application (no. 65075/01 against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Italian nationals, Mrs Giuseppina Procaccini and Mrs Orestina Procaccini (“the applicants”), on 19 November 1997.
The applicants were represented by Mr S. de Nigris de Maria, a lawyer practising in . The Italian Government (“the Government”) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr U. Leanza and Mr I.M. Braguglia, and their co-Agents, Mr V. Esposito and Mr F. Crisafulli. Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28 of the Rules of Court). The Government accordingly appointed Mr L. Ferrari Bravo as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).
On 22 January 2004 the Court declared the application admissible.
The applicants were born in 1932 and 1938 respectively and live in .
On 23 October 1989 Mr G., the applicants' father, brought proceedings against E., a company, in the Benevento District Court to have a contract for the installation of windows in his flat set aside.
Preparation of the case for trial began on 30 November 1989. Of the eighteen hearings listed between 22 March 1990 and 18 May 1998 three were adjourned by the court of its own motion and three because E.'s lawyer had failed to appear, four were devoted to organising expert evidence, five to hearing evidence from witnesses, one was adjourned because the judge had withdrawn from the case, another one was adjourned because Mr G.'s lawyer had failed to appear and a further one was adjourned at his request. The applicants joined the proceedings following Mr G.'s death on 27 March 1995.
On an unspecified date the case was referred to the panel of judges dealing with the oldest cases (sezione stralcio).
Of the six hearings listed between 15 February 1999 and 9 October 2001 two were adjourned by the court of its own motion, one was adjourned by the judge responsible for preparing the case, one was devoted to a request to set the case down for hearing of oral submissions and two to the making of oral submissions.
In a judgment of 30 May 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 31 October 2002, the court granted the applicants' claims in part and awarded them 945.40 euros (EUR) in compensation for the damage sustained.
On 10 October 2001 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto” Act, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicants requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicants claimed 25,000,000 Italian lire (ITL) (EUR 12,911.42) each in non-pecuniary damages.
In a decision of 25 February 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 23 April 2002, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time had been exceeded. It rejected the claim for non-pecuniary damages for lack of proof and awarded a global sum of EUR 2,250 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and EUR 750 for costs and expenses. That decision became binding by 8 June 2003 at the latest. By 12 July 2004 the authorities had still not executed the decision.
In a letter of 7 January 2003 the applicants informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of their application.
In the same letter the applicants also informed the Court that they did not intend to appeal to the Court of Cassation because an appeal to that court could only be on points of law.
