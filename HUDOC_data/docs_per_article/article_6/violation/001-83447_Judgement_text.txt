The case originated in an application (no. 37343/05) against the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, succeeded by Serbia on 3 June 2006 (see paragraph 40 below), lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”), by the ZIT Company (“the applicant”) on 5 October 2005. It was represented before the Court by Ms D. Pavlović, its managing director.
The Government of the State Union of Serbia and  and, subsequently, the Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić.
On 13 July 2006 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was also decided that the merits of the application would be examined together with its admissibility.
The applicant is a company based in Šabac.
On 15 June 2000 the Municipal Court (“Opštinski sud”) in Bačka Palanka formally confirmed an agreement reached between the applicant and one of its business partners, an agricultural cooperative called “Zadrugar” (hereinafter “the debtor”), whereby the latter agreed to pay the former a total of 3,248,567 Yugoslav Dinars by 31 July 2000. In addition and as security for this undertaking, a mortgage in favour of the applicant was established concerning a particular plot of land, at that time listed in the land register as being under the debtor's ownership.
On 21 March 2002 the applicant filed an enforcement request with the same Municipal Court, claiming that the debtor had failed to comply with the above agreement.
On 28 March 2002 the Municipal Court accepted the applicant's request. It ordered the valuation and sale of the land in question, as well as the payment of interest on the applicant's claim.
On 6 June 2003 the municipal authorities in Bačka Palanka reviewed the property status of the real estate in question.
On 28 August 2003, having apparently noted that this land was perhaps not owned by the debtor, the Municipal Court issued an amended enforcement order, stating, inter alia, that the applicant's claim should be settled through the process of evaluation and auctioning of a number of other plots at that time listed in the land register as being owned by the debtor.
On 22 September 2003 the Municipal Court stayed these proceedings until the debtor's ownership of this property had been formally established by the Land Registry (Republicki geodetski zavod).
On 20 February 2004 the Bačka Palanka Division of the Land Registry (Služba za katastar nepokretnosti) decided to suspend the proceedings concerning the debtor's title until the resolution of a separate, already pending, civil case concerning the same property.
It would appear that this civil case, brought by the State, was resolved by 29 September 2004 and that the applicant's co-ownership of the land in question was recognised.
On 21 October 2004 the applicant requested that the enforcement proceedings, stayed by the Municipal Court, be continued.
On 9 December 2003 the  (“Trgovinski sud”) in  ruled in favour of the applicant in another case, ordering the same debtor to pay a total of 2,336,720.80 Serbian Dinars (“CSD”), with interest, plus costs. By 9 January 2004 this judgment became both final and enforceable.
Based on the above judgment and in response to the applicant's request of 26 February 2004, on 28 October 2004 the Municipal Court in Bačka Palanka issued an enforcement order against the debtor for the above payment, plus interest as of 18 July 2003, as well as another CSD 172,234.40 for costs together with interest as of 9 January 2004. For this purpose a number of plots deemed to be owned by the debtor were to be evaluated and auctioned, with the applicant's claim being met from the proceeds.
On 12 November 2004 the Municipal Court in Bačka Palanka decided to join the two sets of enforcement proceedings.
On 1 December 2004 it formally accepted the expert's opinion and valued the land in question.
On 13 December 2004 the Municipal Court scheduled a public auction for 2 February 2005.
On 27 December 2004 the Attorney General (Republički javni pravobranilac) requested, inter alia, that the State itself be allowed to take part in the proceedings, and noted that the auction should only be carried out in respect of the plots which were undisputedly owned by the debtor.
On 2 February 2005 the auction was postponed by the Municipal Court. It was re-scheduled for 16 February 2005.
On 16 February 2005 the Attorney General repeated the request of 27 December 2004.
On 16 February 2005 the auction was postponed and re-scheduled for 23 March 2005.
On 16 March 2005 the Municipal Court informed the parties that the auction was again postponed for 30 days because the Municipal Public Prosecutor had urged the Chief Public Prosecutor “to file a Request for the Protection of Legality” (zahtev za zaštitu zakonitosti).
On 19 August 2005 the Municipal Court accepted the debtor's motion that the value of the land at issue needed to be re-assessed.
On 17 March 2006 the Municipal Court held a public auction and recognised the applicant as the new co-owner of a number of plots formerly co-owned by the debtor.
Several days later, the applicant's representatives saw these plots and concluded that they were still being used by the debtor.
On 4 April 2006 the Municipal Court ordered that the land be handed over to the applicant and, further, that the applicant's newly acquired ownership be entered in the land register.
On 7 April 2006 the Municipal Court rectified a minor textual error in its decision of 4 April 2006.
In a separate decision issued on 7 April 2006, the Municipal Court ordered the transfer to the applicant's bank account of the remaining proceeds from its pecuniary claim, and the applicant waived its right to file an appeal against that decision.
Notwithstanding the Municipal Court's decision of 4 April 2006 the debtor refused to provide the applicant with access to and use of the plots of land in question.
On 8 May 2006 the applicant filed a civil trespass claim, seeking possession of this land.
On 15 September 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant, stating that it had no possession to begin with, which is why none could be restored.
Article 2 provides that enforcement proceedings shall be instituted at the request of the creditor, but may, exceptionally, also be instituted by the court ex officio when “the law so provides”.
Article 4 § 1 states that all enforcement proceedings are to be conducted urgently.
Articles 134-176 regulate enforcement through the auctioning of the debtor's real estate. They do not, however, contain specific provisions in respect of situations where a debtor refuses to comply with a judicial decision to transfer property to the buyer.
Articles 232-237 set out the details concerning “court-sanctioned mortgages” (založno pravo na nepokretnim i pokretnim stvarima na osnovu sporazuma stranaka). Article 237, in particular, states that all such mortgages constitute valid enforcement titles.
This Act entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Enforcement Procedure Act 2000. In accordance with Article 304, however, all enforcement proceedings instituted prior to 23 February 2005 are to be concluded pursuant to the earlier legislation.
A buyer of real estate auctioned by a court in enforcement proceedings shall have the right to request the eviction of the former owner, based on the decision adopted by the enforcement court, there being no need to bring a separate civil suit in this regard (see Gzz. 55/89, adopted by the Supreme Court of Vojvodina).
These provisions are set out in the V.A.M. v. Serbia (no. 39177/05, §§ 67-72, 13 March 2007) and the EVT Company v. Serbia judgments (no. 3102/05, §§ 29-31, 21 June 2007), respectively.
The relevant provisions concerning the succession of the State Union of Serbia and  are set out in the Matijašević v. Serbia judgment (no. 23037/04, §§ 22-25, 19 September 2006).
