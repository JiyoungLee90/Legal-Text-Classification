The case originated in an application (no. 6338/11) against the Republic of Moldova lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Moldovan national, Mr Sergiu Carpov (“the applicant”), on 13 January 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr V. Duca, a lawyer practising in Orhei. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr O. Rotari.
On 20 December 2017 notice of the application was given to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Orhei.
In September 2009 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against a company which was in process of insolvency.
On 18 December 2009 the Drochia District Court found in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant company to pay him 24,957 Moldovan Lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 1,413 euros (EUR)) for pecuniary damage and MDL 749 (the equivalent of EUR 42) for costs and expenses. The representative of the defendant company was not present at the hearing.
On 28 December 2009 the secretariat of the Drochia District Court sent a copy of the reasoned judgment to the defendant company by ordinary mail.
On 11 January 2010 an enforcement writ was issued to the applicant by the same court in respect of the judgment of 18 December 2009.
On 10 February 2010, in a different set of proceedings concerning the insolvency of the defendant company, the company’s insolvency administrator updated the list of creditors by making express reference to the judgment of 18 December 2009 and to the exact amounts awarded in that judgment. The court which treated the insolvency issued a decision concerning the updated list of creditors on the same date.
On 26 April 2010 the insolvency administrator of the defendant company lodged an appeal against the judgment of 18 December 2009. The applicant objected to the appeal by arguing that it had been time-barred. He indicated that the time-limit for lodging the appeal had expired twenty days after the serving of the impugned judgment and that the insolvency administrator of the defendant company had been aware of the judgment of 18 December 2009 since in February 2010 he had informed the court dealing with the insolvency proceedings about the judgment in question.
On 28 September 2010 the Bălţi Court of Appeal admitted the appeal lodged by the insolvency administrator of the defendant company and quashed the judgment of 18 December 2009. The Court of Appeal did respond to the objection raised by the applicant and, after re-examining the merits of the case, dismissed the applicant’s action against the defendant company. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law raising the same arguments as in his appeal.
On 26 January 2011 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of the lower court. The Supreme Court did not make any comment about the applicant’s objection concerning the late appeal.
According to Article 362 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the material time, a judgment issued by a first instance court could be challenged by way of an appeal within twenty days as from the date of service of the reasoned judgment.
