The case originated in an application (no. 24899/15) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Sunčica Stojković (“the applicant”), on 6 May 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr Đ. Blagojević, a lawyer practising in Niš. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 28 June 2016 the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings was communicated to the Government, while the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of the Court.
The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Bujanovac.
The applicant complains about the excessive length of administrative proceedings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The proceedings at issue began on 10 October 2005 when the applicant lodged an appeal against a first instance administrative decision of 28 September 2005 whereby her already recognised employment-related benefits were to be reduced. On 23 January 2006 this appeal was rejected at second instance and the applicant then decided to seek judicial review of this rejection. On 4 September 2008 the Administrative Court quashed the administrative decisions rendered at first and second instance. On 6 May 2009 a new administrative decision was thus issued at first instance but on 22 May 2009 the applicant again lodged an appeal against it. On 9 October 2009 the impugned decision was quashed at second instance. On 19 October 2009 a third administrative decision was hence rendered at first instance but it was also appealed by the applicant. On 21 January 2010, however, this appeal was rejected at second instance. On 4 February 2010 the applicant sought further judicial review of the rejection. Ultimately, on 17 March 2011 the Administrative Court issued the final decision in the matter and in so doing ruled against the applicant.
The applicant thereafter attempted to obtain redress for the alleged breach of her right to a hearing within a reasonable time. On 4 November 2014, however, the Constitutional Court rejected her appeal. It found that the case had indeed not been complex, had, in fact, been very significant for the applicant, that the administrative authorities more or less had acted within the legally set timelines, but that the proceedings had been somewhat prolonged due to the conduct of the administrative authorities, but considered, regardless, that no violation of the Constitution could be established since the applicant could not have been uncertain at any point in time of the inevitably unfavourable outcome of her claim.
