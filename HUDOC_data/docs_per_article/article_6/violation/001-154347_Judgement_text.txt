The case originated in an application (no. 78165/12) against the Portuguese Republic lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Portuguese national, Mr Jorge de Jesus Ferreira Alves (“the applicant”), on 23 November 2012.
The Portuguese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. F. da Graça Carvalho, Deputy-Attorney General.
On 4 March 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant, a lawyer, was born in 1953 and lives in Matosinhos.
On 22 February 2008 the Porto Ethics Council (Conselho Deontológico do Porto) of the Portuguese Bar Association (Ordem dos Advogados) instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant, following a complaint introduced by the Administrative Central Court of the North (Tribunal Central Administrativo do Norte) against the latter (disciplinary proceedings no. 100/2008). In particular, the complaint concerned the applicant’s request made in the course of four different tort actions against the State, in which he was a legal representative, to have a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights translated and paid by the domestic court.
On 10 March 2008 the applicant was summoned of the disciplinary proceedings and on 13 March 2008 he presented his submissions.
On 9 November 2012 the Ethics Council dismissed the case for being time-barred.
Article 125 of the Statute of the Portuguese Bar Association reads as follows in the relevant parts:
“The disciplinary penalties are:
...
e) suspension up to ten years;
f) expulsion ...”
