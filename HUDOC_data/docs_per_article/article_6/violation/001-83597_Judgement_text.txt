The case originated in two applications (nos. 9956/05 and 13200/05) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Ukrainian nationals, Mr Viktor Leontiyovych Derevenko of Tarashcha born in 1954 and Mr Volodymyr Semenovych Dovgalyuk of Oleksandriya born in 1945 (“the applicants”), on 22 February and 31 March 2005.
The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev.
On 13 December 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaints concerning the delay in enforcement of the final judgments in the applicants' favour to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility.
On 12 March 2003 the first applicant obtained a judgment of the  (Таращанський районний суд Київської області) against the OJSC “Tarashcharayagropostach” (ВАТ “Таращарайагропостач”), awarding him 2,424.55 hryvnyas (UAH) in salary arrears and other payments.
On 19 March 2001 the second applicant obtained a judgment of the  (Олександрійський міський суд Кіровоградської області) against the OJSC “ATP-13506” (ВАТ АТП-13506), awarding him UAH 2,765.02 in salary arrears.
These judgments were not appealed against, became final and the enforcement proceedings were instituted to collect the judgments debts.
On several occasions the bailiffs notified the applicants that they were unable to collect the full amounts of the awards, referring to the fact that financial assets of the debtor-companies were insufficient. They further explained that other assets could not be sold, as the State owned more than 25% of the debtor-companies' share capital. The companies were therefore subject to the Law of 29 November 2001 “on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property”. The first applicant attempted to challenge the alleged inactivity of the bailiffs and to institute criminal proceedings against the debtor-company's chief executive officer, however, his attempts were to no avail.
By 10 June and 12 August 2005 the judgments given in favour of the second and the first applicant, respectively, were enforced in full.
A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, § 17-22, 26 April 2005).
