The case was referred to the Court, as established under former Article 19 of the Convention3, by the Italian Government (“the Government”) on 18 September 1998 within the three-month period laid down by former Articles 32 § 1 and 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 33440/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 by an Italian national, Mrs Marcella Ferrari, on 14 September 1995.
The Government’s application referred to former Articles 44 and 48 as amended by Protocol no. 9, which Italy had ratified, and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (former Article 46). The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The applicant designated Mr F. E. Abbate as the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 31 of former Rules of Court B).
As President of the Chamber which had originally been constituted (former Article 43 of the Convention and former Rule 21) in order to deal, in particular, with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, Mr R. Bernhardt, the President of the Court at the time, acting through the Registrar, consulted Mr U. Leanza, the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and Mr B. Conforti, the Delegate of the Commission, on the organisation of the written procedure. Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 16 November 1998 and the Government’s memorial on 17 November 1998.
After the entry into force of Protocol No. 11 on 1 November 1998 and in accordance with Article 5 § 5 thereof and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the present case and the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, A.L.M. and A. P. v. Italy were referred to the same Grand Chamber of the Court. The Grand Chamber included ex officio Mr Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 24 § 4 of the Rules of Court), Mr L. Wildhaber, the President of the Court, Mrs E. Palm, Vice-President of the Court, and
The President decided that it was not necessary to invite the Commission to nominate a delegate in the case (Rule 99).
After consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer, the Grand Chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing.
On 4 January 1999 the Registrar received additional observations from the applicant.
Subsequently Mrs Palm replaced Mr Wildhaber, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case, as President of the Grand Chamber, and Mr W. Fuhrmann, substitute judge, replaced him as a member of the Chamber (Rules 10 and 24 § 5 (b)). Mrs F. Tulkens and Mr J. Casadevall, substitute judges, replaced Mr Kūris and Mr Makarczyk, who were likewise unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rule 24 § 5 (b)).
The applicant, who was born in 1911, lives in Rome.
On 31 January 1990 she instituted proceedings in the Rome District Court against a local health clinic in Rome for payment of an adjustment for inflation and of statutory interest in respect of arrears of her widow’s pension which had been paid six years late.
At the first hearing, on 9 March 1990, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the judge preparing the case for trial directed that the final submissions be made on 24 March 1990. That hearing was adjourned of the court’s own motion to 24 January 1991 because the judge had been transferred. The trial before the relevant division was held on 14 October 1991.  In a judgment of 24 October 1991, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 9 December 1991, the court declined jurisdiction on account of the subject-matter of the case and indicated that the Rome magistrate (pretore), sitting as an employment judge, had jurisdiction to hear it.
On 13 February 1992 the applicant resumed the proceedings before the Rome magistrate. At the first hearing, on 25 November 1992, the court noted that the defendant had failed to appear and the magistrate appointed an expert, who took the oath on 15 February 1993. On 23 June 1993 the magistrate withdrew to consider the case. In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 22 July 1993, the magistrate allowed the applicant’s claim in part.
On 20 July 1994 the applicant appealed to the Rome District Court. On 18 October 1994 the first hearing was set down for 4 December 1996. It was subsequently brought forward, at the applicant’s request, to 1 December 1995. It was then adjourned to 13 December 1995 because the judge preparing the case for trial was unable to attend, and then to 2 February 1996 because the registry had not sent the file relating to the
The court deliberated on 13 March 1998 and in a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 6 August 1998, allowed the applicant’s appeal in part.
Mrs Ferrari applied to the Commission on 14 September 1995. She complained that her case had not been heard within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 33440/96) admissible on 3 December 1997. In its report of 20 May 1998 (former Article 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (thirteen votes to three).
The Government acknowledged that the proceedings at issue had not complied with the “reasonable time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and submitted that if a finding were made that there had been a violation, such a finding would in itself amount to adequate just satisfaction.
Counsel for the applicant asked the Court to hold that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 and to award his client just satisfaction.
