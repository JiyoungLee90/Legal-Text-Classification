The case was referred to the Court by the Italian Government (“the Government”) on 29 July 1997, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 31648/96) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by an Italian national, Mr S.R. (“the applicant”), on 5 May 1993.
The Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 and to the declaration whereby Italy recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46). The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicant stated that he did not wish to take part in the proceedings.
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 27 August 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr N. Valticos, Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr U. Lōhmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 § 1 and 40). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial and the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction on 7 January 1998. On 26 January 1998 the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate did not wish to submit observations in writing.
On 10 December 1997 the Commission had produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the instructions of the President of the Chamber.
In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 29 January 1998. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
The Court heard addresses by Mr Soyer and Mr Esposito.
As Mr Macdonald was unable to take part in the deliberations on 25 March 1998, he was replaced by Sir John Freeland, substitute judge (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).
Mr S.R., who was born in 1924, lives in Livorno. He was a civil servant until 1984, when he retired.
On 27 July 1988 the applicant applied to the Court of Audit in Rome for the annulment of decisions of the Minister of Transport and the Italian State Railway Company refusing his request to have an additional period of employment of about one year taken into account for the calculation of his pension.
The first hearing was set down for 16 May 1990, but had to be adjourned to allow State Counsel to file his submissions. This he did on 6 September 1990. At the conclusion of a hearing on 12 June 1991 the court ordered the Social Security Department and the State Railway Company to produce a number of documents. The documents in question were lodged on various dates before 12 March 1993.
On 22 December 1993, in accordance with a request made by the applicant on 16 December, the case was transferred to the Tuscany Regional Division of the Court of Audit. By an order of 22 April 1994 the Regional Division stayed the proceedings pending a decision of the Court of Audit in plenary session on the jurisdiction of the regional divisions. The text of this decision was deposited with the registry on 29 July 1994.
By a judgment of 10 May 1995, which was deposited with the registry on 11 September 1995, the Tuscany Regional Division allowed the applicant’s claim in part.
Mr S.R. applied to the Commission on 5 May 1993. Relying on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he complained of the length of the proceedings in the Court of Audit.
On 4 March 1997 the Commission (First Chamber) declared the application (no. 31648/96) admissible. In its report of 28 May 1997 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
The Government asked the Court to hold that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.
The applicant called upon the Court to find a violation of that provision and to award him just satisfaction.
