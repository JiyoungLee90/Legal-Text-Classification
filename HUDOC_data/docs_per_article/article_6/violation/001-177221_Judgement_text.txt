The case originated in an application (no. 24465/11) against the Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Ms Ljiljana Radulović (“the applicant”), on 16 March 2011.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, who was subsequently substituted by their current Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 1 September 2015 the application was communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Bor.
The applicant was employed by the bank called Borska banka AD, (“the debtor”). It would appear that at the relevant time the debtor was predominantly comprised of socially-owned capital.
On 13 February 2004 the Zaječar Commercial Court opened insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor.
.  On 8 February 2005, upon a submission to that effect, the Zaječar Commercial Court recognised the applicant’s claims concerning salary arrears.
. On an unspecified date the applicant was paid 8,533 Serbian dinars (RSD) on account of the debt in question. The remainder of the debt has not been paid until the present day.
The insolvency proceedings are still pending.
On 14 December 2006 the applicant applied to the Zaječar Commercial Court for enforcement of the court’s decision of 8 February 2005, by which the applicant’s claims were recognised. The Zaječar Commercial Court, however, declined its jurisdiction ratione materiae and transferred the case file to the Bor Municipal Court.
On 7 May 2007 the Bor Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s enforcement request. In its reasoning, the Court stated that the Commercial Court’s decision of 8 February 2005 was not suitable for execution.
On 23 November 2007 the Zaječar District Court upheld the first instance court’s decision, stating that the debtor had been subject to the pending insolvency proceedings.
.  On 18 March 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the Zaječar District Court’s decision.
On 4 November 2010 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal. It found that the applicant had failed to properly seize the Constitutional Court, having lodged her appeal against “the wrong” decision.
The relevant domestic law concerning the status of socially-owned entities, as well as insolvency proceedings, is outlined in the cases of R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06 et al., §§ 57-64 and 71-76, 15 January 2008 and Jovičić and Others v. Serbia (dec.), no. 37270/11, §§ 88-93, 15 October 2013.
