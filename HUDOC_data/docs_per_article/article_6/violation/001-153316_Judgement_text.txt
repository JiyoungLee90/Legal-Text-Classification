The case originated in an application (no. 13274/11) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by three Croatian nationals, Ms Davorka Pavlović, Ms Dubravka Družinec and Ms Višnja Lacko (“the applicants”), on 3 February 2011.
The applicants were represented by Ms K. Kantura, a lawyer practising in Zabok. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicants alleged that they had been erroneously deprived of the reimbursement of costs in civil proceedings, contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.
On 16 September 2013 the complaints were communicated to the Government, and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicants were born in 1959, 1950 and 1952 respectively, and live in Brestovec Orehovički and Krapina respectively.
In 1990 I. Ku., the applicants’ predecessor, brought a civil action in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) against M.K., seeking his eviction from a flat and reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings.
In 2001, following the death of I. Ku, the applicants, as his heirs, took over the proceedings as plaintiffs, while M. K. also died in the course of proceedings and I. Kr. replaced him as defendant.
During the proceedings, I. Kr. brought a counterclaim against the applicants, seeking either a specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue or compensation for investments in the flat he had made in the amount of 95,000 Croatian kunas (HRK). The applicants also, in addition to I. Ku.’s civil action, requested the Zagreb Municipal Court to order I. Kr. to remove everything he had installed in the flat.
At the closing hearing before the Zagreb Municipal Court on 12 June 2007 the applicants reiterated all their arguments and requested reimbursement of the costs of proceedings. At the same hearing, the applicants submitted a written itemised claim for costs in the amount of HRK 14,786.40. At the same time, the defendant’s representative reiterated his arguments and requested reimbursement of the costs in the amount which he promised to specify later.
On the same day the Zagreb Municipal Court allowed the applicants’ action in part, ordering the eviction of I. Kr. from the flat, whereas it dismissed the remainder of their civil action, as well as I. Kr.’s counterclaim for compensation of the investments in the flat. As regards the costs of the proceedings, the Zagreb Municipal Court noted:
“With regard to the costs of the proceedings, each party shall bear their own costs, as provided under section 154 § 2 of the Civil Procedure Act, since the plaintiff succeeded with part of [their] action while [they] were dismissed as regards the remainder, and the counterclaim was fully dismissed.”
On 10 October 2008, in a supplementary judgment, the Zagreb Municipal Court dismissed I. Kr.’s civil action for a specially protected tenancy.
Meanwhile, the parties challenged the first-instance judgment of the Zagreb Municipal Court of 12 June 2007 before the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu). The applicants argued that the first-instance court had incorrectly assessed the situation concerning their right to reimbursement of the costs of proceedings.
On 2 February 2010 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) dismissed the appeals and upheld the first-instance judgment. As regards the applicants’ arguments concerning the costs of proceedings, the Zagreb County Court noted:
“... it is to be noted that [the applicants] correctly consider that they should be reimbursed the costs of the proceedings, since the part of their claim by which they sought the eviction [of I. Kr.] from the flat was successful. However, it is to be noted that the case file shows that they failed to comply with the requirement under section 164 § 3 of the Civil Procedure Act, which provides that a party must set out his or her request for reimbursement of costs at the latest at the end of the closing hearing which precedes the decision on costs. At the hearing held on 12 June 2007, by which the proceedings terminated, [the applicants’] representative sought reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings based on an itemised claim which he was supposed to submit. However, there is no such itemised claim in the case file, and the reimbursement of costs was not sought earlier, while certain procedural actions were being taken. This is the reason why the costs of the proceedings could not be reimbursed to [the applicants].”
On 14 April 2010 the applicants challenged the judgment of the Zagreb County Court by lodging a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). They pointed out that the Zagreb County Court had manifestly incorrectly assessed their request for reimbursement of the costs of the proceedings, overlooking the fact that they had indeed submitted in writing an itemised claim for costs, and had therefore arbitrarily dismissed their complaints in that respect.
On 23 September 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the applicants’ constitutional complaint inadmissible, on the grounds that the contested judgment had not concerned the merits of their civil rights or obligations, and as such was not susceptible to constitutional review. This decision was served on the applicants on 18 October 2010.
The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998 (consolidated text), 113/2000, 124/2000 (consolidated text), 28/2001 and 41/2001 (consolidated text), and 55/2001 (corrigendum), 76/2010, 85/2010, 05/2014) read as follows:
“In the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.”
“The right of ownership shall be guaranteed ...“
The relevant part of section 62 of the Constitutional Court Act (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 99/1999, 29/2002, 49/2002) reads:
“Anyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that a decision (pojedinačni akt) of a State body, a body of local and regional self-government, or a legal person with public authority, which has decided on his or her rights and obligations, or about a suspicion or accusation of a criminal act, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms, or his or her right to local and regional self-government guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter “constitutional right”) ...”
According to the information provided by the Government, on the basis of a letter of the Constitutional Court of 29 December 2014, that court on 15 July 2004 published on its Internet site examples and practical instructions for the appellants on how to fill in the constitutional complaints, as well as list of decisions of various domestic authorities which are not liable to be reviewed on the basis of individual constitutional complaints. This document runs on seventy-six pages and the information on its publishing was disseminated through media and in particular an Internet news portal (). On 8 July 2014 the document at issue was separated into several separate documents (examples of the constitutional complaints; practical instructions on how to fill in a constitutional complaint; list of decisions of various domestic authorities which are not liable to be reviewed on the basis of individual constitutional complaints) and updated with the case-law developments of the Constitutional Court.
Whereas the document of 2004 does not list the civil courts’ decisions on the costs and expenses of the proceedings as decisions which are not liable to be reviewed on the basis of individual constitutional complaints, further updates to that document, allegedly carried out in July 2014 and provided in separate documents, indicate such information.
The Government also referred in particular to the decisions of the Constitutional Court nos. U-III-402/2002 of 12 September 2003; UIII 4020/2003 of 30 June 2004; and U-III-1821/2004 of 10 September 2004, by which that court declined to examine the complaints related to the costs and expenses of the proceedings.
According to the information provided by the applicants, referring to the publicly available information on the properties of the documents, the separate list of decisions of various domestic authorities which are not liable to be reviewed on the basis of individual constitutional complaints was created on 9 July 2014 and modified on 13 August 2014. It was made publicly available on an unspecified date after 9 July 2014.
The Civil Procedure Act (Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007 and 84/2008), as in force at the relevant time, provided as follows:
“(1)  A party who loses a case completely shall reimburse the costs of the opposing party and his or her intervener.
(2)  If a party succeeds in the proceedings in part, the court may, having regard to the success achieved, order that each party shall bear its own costs or that one party shall reimburse the other party and the intervener the corresponding part of the costs ...”
“(1)  The court shall decide on the reimbursement of costs on the basis of a request by either party ...
(2)  The party is obliged to itemise costs in respect of which he or she seeks reimbursement.
(3)  The party is obliged to set out its request for reimbursement at the latest at the end of the closing hearing which precedes the decision on costs ...”
The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act with further amendments (Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008, 123/2008, 57/2011, 148/2011, 25/2013 and 89/2014) provides as follows:
“(1)  When the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of a human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or additional protocols thereto ratified by the Republic of Croatia, a party may, within thirty days of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights becoming final, apply to the court in the Republic of Croatia which adjudicated in the first instance in the proceedings in which the decision violating the human right or fundamental freedom was rendered, to set aside the decision by which the human right or fundamental freedom was violated.
(2)  Proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted by applying, mutatis mutandis, the provisions on the reopening of proceedings.
(3)  In reopened proceedings the courts are required to respect the legal opinions expressed in the final judgment of the European Court of Human Rights finding a violation of a fundamental human right or freedom.”
