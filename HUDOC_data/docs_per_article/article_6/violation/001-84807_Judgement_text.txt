On 6 July 2001 the court awarded the applicant a lump sum of 43,241.61 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) and monthly payments of UAH 834.31 (рішення Центрально-міського суду м. Горлівки). This judgment became final on 3 December 2001.
On 23 January 2002 the Tsentralno-Miskyy District Bailiffs’ Service of Gorlivka (відділ Державної виконавчої служби Управління юстиції Центрально-міського району м. Горлівки) initiated the enforcement proceedings.
By letters of 17 April, 14 May, 27 December 2002 and 21 November 2003, the Bailiffs’ Service informed the applicant that it was impossible to sell the debtor’s property because, according to the Law on the Introduction of a Moratorium on the Forced Sale of Property, on 26 December 2001 a ban on the forced sale of assets belonging to undertakings in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital had been introduced.
On 27 February 2003 the applicant was paid UAH 11,546.43. According to the Government, in 2005 the applicant had been paid UAH 1,475.64 in addition to the aforesaid sum. No document in support of this statement has been submitted.
The applicant disagreed, stating that he had been paid UAH 11,546.43 only.
Both parties agreed that the court judgment remains partly unenforced.
