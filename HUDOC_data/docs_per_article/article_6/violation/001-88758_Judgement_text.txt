The case originated in an application (no. 5194/07) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian limited liability company, Pepszolg Kft “V.A.” (an entity in winding-up, represented by an administrator), on 13 January 2007. While the proceedings were pending before the Court, another Hungarian limited liability company, Ecoprevent Kft (“the applicant company”) became its successor.
The applicant company was represented by Mr G. Havas, a lawyer practising in . The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement.
On 9 January 2008 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant is a limited liability company, founded in 2006, with its seat in .
On 10 August 1992 its predecessor (see paragraph 1 above) requested the  to issue an order for payment against another company.
The court ordered the respondent to make a payment of 61,369 Hungarian forints (approximately 250 euros (EUR)). Since the latter contested the order, on 5 April 1993 the proceedings became litigation.
After having held three hearings, the  found for the plaintiff in April 1995. On appeal, the Supreme Court quashed this decision in October 1996 and remitted the case to the first-instance court.
Between 6 February 1998 and 13 July 2003 the proceedings were stayed, pending the plaintiff’s identifying the respondent’s legal successor. After the latter had finally entered the proceedings, a procedural dispute evolved, at the end of which, apparently in February 2006, the  noted that, since the original respondent had ceased to exist on 1 April 1993, the proceedings had been interrupted on that date. Thus, all the actions of the parties and all the decisions delivered by the courts after that date were invalid.
Eventually, in November 2006 the  ordered the resumption of the proceedings and transferred the case to the Pest Central District Court, which had acquired jurisdiction to hear the case due to an amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure.
On 20 February 2007 the District Court allowed the applicant company to replace the original plaintiff.
On 5 December 2007 the District Court found for the applicant company. None of the parties appealed and the decision became final on 22 January 2008.
