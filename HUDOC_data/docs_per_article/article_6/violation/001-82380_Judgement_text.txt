The case originated in an application (no. 31790/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Mrs Nina Mizernaia (“the applicant”), on 25 July 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mr Vitalie Iordachi, a lawyer practising in Chişinău and member of the non-governmental organisation “Lawyers for Human Rights”. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Mr Vitalie Pârlog.
The applicant complained that the failure to enforce a final judgment in her favour violated her right to have her civil rights determined by a court as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.
The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court. On 9 February 2006 the President of that Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it was decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.
The applicant and the Government each filed observations on admissibility, merits and just satisfaction.
The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Chişinău.
After having been excluded in 1994 from a State-run apartment building association, the applicant brought an action against it, seeking the restitution of the money she had invested in a three-roomed apartment.
On 29 April 1996 the Râşcani District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered the building association to pay her 23,733.80 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 4,550 euros (EUR) at the time).
The building association appealed unsuccessfully against the judgment on two occasions and, by a final judgment of 4 November 1997, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 29 April 1996.
In December 1997 and May 1998 the applicant received MDL 3,071.10 and MDL 1,970, respectively.
Following several complaints about non-enforcement of the judgment lodged by the applicant with the Ministry of Justice, on 5 September 2000 and on 19 January 2001 the Ministry of Justice requested the Bailiff to take all the necessary steps to enforce the judgment.
The final judgment of 4 November 1997 has not been enforced to date.
The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004... (extracts)) and Popov v. Moldova (no. 74153/01, §§ 29-41, 18 January 2005).
