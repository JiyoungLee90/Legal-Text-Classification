The applicant Mr Petro Andriyovych Plyaka died (application no. 38936/12). His spouse, Ms Valentyna Oleksandrivana Kuzmina, manifested the wish to pursue the application on his behalf.

Copies of the letters were forwarded to the deceased applicants’ addresses on 27 March and 10 April 2013 respectively, by registered post for comments to be submitted by 23 April and 10 May 2013. The readers were warned that in the absence of response, the Court would assume that the applicants had died and that no individuals were entitled and wished to pursue the applications.
