The case originated in two applications (nos. 3141/08 and 41640/08) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Russian nationals. The applicants’ names and the dates of their applications to the Court appear in the Appendix.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented initially by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights, and then by his successor in that office, Mr M. Galperin.
On 30 August 2016 complaints concerning quashing by way of supervisory review of the final judgments in the applicants’ favour were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application no. 3141/08 was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
All the applicants were parties to civil proceedings in which the firstinstance and appeal courts found in their favour. These judgments became final but were subsequently quashed by the supervisory review courts on the grounds of incorrect application of substantive law (for more details see the Appendix).
The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure in force between 1 February 2003 and 7 January 2008 is summarised in Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).
