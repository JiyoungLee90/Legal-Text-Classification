The case originated in an application (no. 30276/03) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Czech national, Milan Dušek (“the applicant”), on 12 September 2003.
The applicant was represented by Mrs H. Peterková, a lawyer practising in Litomyšl. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm.
On 15 March 2005 the Court decided to communicate the application. Applying Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time.
The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Litomyšl.
On 19 June 1998 the Blansko District Court (okresní soud) invited the applicant to pay court fees. On 24 June 1998 the applicant requested to be exempted from court fees. On 10 September 1998 he informed the court that he did not receive welfare benefits. On 16 December 1998 the court granted the applicant’s request.
In the meantime, on 7 October 1998, the court had received the applicant’s request for an interim measure.
On 18 February 1999 the court invited the applicant to clarify his action. Having received this invitation on 12 March 1999, the applicant replied on 18 March 1999.
On 18 May 1999 the court asked the Svitavy District Police Directorate (okresní ředitelství policie) to verify the identification data of the lorry concerned. The court received this information on 24 May 1999.
According to the Government, the applicant did not attend, without an excuse, a hearing held on 27 May 1999 which was then adjourned sine die. The applicant submits that his legal representative was present at the hearing, together with his ex-wife who was ready to be heard as a witness and that, actually, it was the defendant who did not attend the hearing.
On 30 June 1999 the District Court discontinued the proceedings for an interim measure sought by the applicant. On 16 September 1999 the latter appealed to the  (krajský soud) which, on 24 October 2000, quashed this decision and remitted the case to the District Court, which decided in the applicant’s favour on 22 November 2000.
On 15 January 2001 the applicant modified his action, claiming CZK 140,000 (EUR 4,667) should C. could not return the lorry.
After a hearing on 30 January 2001, the District Court delivered a judgment in which it ordered C. to pay this sum together with the court fees. On 14 March 2001 C. appealed requesting, at the same time, to be exempted from court fees. On 27 July 2001 the District Court granted his request and, on 14 September 2001, sent the case file to the  which, on 24 November 2003, modified the first instance judgment, ordering C. to pay CZK 28,000 (EUR 966) to the applicant.
On 11 May 2004 the latter filed an appeal on points of law (dovolání) with the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud) where, it seems, the proceedings are still pending.
