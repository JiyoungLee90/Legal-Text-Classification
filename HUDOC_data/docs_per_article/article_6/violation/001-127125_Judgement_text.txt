The case originated in an application (no. 48150/11) against the Republic of Hungary lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Hungarian national, Mr Péter Börzsönyi (“the applicant”), on 24 July 2011.
The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Z. Tallódi, Agent, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice.
On 5 April 2013 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Budapest.
From 1 April 1999 until 30 June 2004 the applicant was employed as a civil servant. On 17 June 2005 he brought an action against his former employer before the Pest County Labour Court, challenging his previous civil service grade and claiming payment for outstanding salary, allowance in lieu of untaken leave and compensation for non-pecuniary damage.
On 8 July 2008 the court ordered the respondent to pay 1,863,322 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 6,400 euros (EUR)) and accrued interests for outstanding salaries, reward and allowance in lieu of untaken holidays.
By its decision of 30 October 2009 the Pest County Regional Court decreased the amount to HUF 1,618,883 (approximately EUR 5,500) and accrued interests. The applicant submitted a petition for review against this decision.
On 2 February 2011 the Supreme Court increased the amount payable to the applicant to HUF 1,982,813 (approximately EUR 6,800) and accrued interests. This decision was served on the applicant on 3 March 2011.
