The case originated in seven applications (nos. 50117/13, 50776/13, 60349/13, 62038/13, 63099/13, 64201/13 and 68381/13) against Serbia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The applicants were all Serbian nationals and their further personal and other relevant details are set out in the appendix to this judgment.
The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Ms V. Rodić, who was subsequently substituted by their current Agent, Ms. N. Plavšić.
On 1 September 2015 and 2 November 2015 the complaints concerning the non-enforcement of the domestic decisions in question were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the applications were declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The Government objected to the examination of the application by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The applicants complained about the failure by the national authorities to enforce final court decisions rendered in their favour.
All applicants obtained decisions by the Constitutional Court, which established a violation of their right to a hearing within reasonable time and awarded them certain sums in respect of the non-pecuniary damage suffered (see the appendix to this judgment).
