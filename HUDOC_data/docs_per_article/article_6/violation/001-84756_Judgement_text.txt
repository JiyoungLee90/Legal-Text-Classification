The applicant made several unsuccessful applications for release.
On 20 March 2001 the Poznan Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention.

The Court of Appeal also examined the course of the proceedings and established that they had been lengthy.

The court, nevertheless, stated that the applicant had been solely responsible for the duration of the trial as the  had to examine his allegation that he had acted in self-defence.

The court further stressed that the trial would end soon since most of the witnesses had already been heard.
On 27 October 2004 the applicant filed a complaint alleging that the proceedings against him had exceeded a reasonable time and requesting compensation for the prolongation of the proceedings. He relied on the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”).

It also held that between 1989 and 1998 the applicant had been convicted five times and that the charges against him had included unlawful possession of a firearm. This decision was upheld on appeal on 18 May 2006.
On 1 June 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's complaint under the 2004 Act about the alleged inactivity of the . The court examined only the period after 18 February 2005 as the period before that date had already been examined.
