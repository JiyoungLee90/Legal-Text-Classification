Although the property and accounts of the military unit were frozen by the Leninskiy Bailiffs’ Service the funds obtained were insufficient for the payment of the amount due to the applicant.
On 26 March 2003 the Leninskiy Bailiffs’ Service forwarded the applicant’s writ of execution together with the enforcement case-file to the Bailiffs’ Service of the Oleksandrivskiy district of Kirovograd region (Відділ державної виконавчої служби Олександрівського районного управління юстиції Кіровоградської області, hereafter “the Oleksandrivskiy Bailiffs’ Service”).

This sum corresponds to the total amount of the remaining debts owed to the applicant and Mr Mayadnnyk, the applicant in case no. 20826/02.
On 1 December 2004 the Oleksandrivskiy Bailiffs’ Service terminated the proceedings in the applicant’s enforcement case on the grounds that the judgment of 12 February 2001 had been executed in full. The applicant stated that he had not been informed of the transfer and had not received any money as a result of it.

On 28 July 2003 the Leninsky District Court of Kirovograd (Ленінський районний суд м. Кіровоград, hereafter “the Leninskiy Court”) granted this claim in part and awarded the applicant UAH 1,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage incurred as the result of the Leninskiy Bailiffs’ Service’s failure to perform in time its duties set forth in the Law of 21 April 1999 “on Enforcement Proceedings”.

Despite several requests of the Court, neither the applicant nor the Government furnished any information on the course or the outcome of these proceedings.
