The case originated in four applications against Romania lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Romanian companies and six Romanian nationals on the various dates indicated in the appended table. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 27 June 2012 the applications were communicated to the Government.
The Government objected to the examination of the applications by a Committee. After having considered the Government’s objection, the Court rejects it.
The list of applicants and the relevant details of the applications are set out in the appended table.
The applicants lost their court cases consisting of civil proceedings held in their absence. The notices of the court proceedings had been served on them solely by means of posting them on a gate or wall (hereinafter “by public notice” – citarea prin afişare). They all argued in their subsequent appeals, whether appeals in cassation (when the notices were served during the first-instance proceedings or the appeal hearings took place) or appeals seeking the quashing of the final decision (contestaţie în anulare) (when the notices were served during the proceedings at the court of last instance), that they had not been aware of the date of the court proceedings as they had never received the relevant notifications from the courts. Their complaints to that effect were dismissed by the courts on the grounds that service by public notice was provided for by law. Consequently their appeals were dismissed without examination of the merits of the cases.
The relevant domestic law in force at the time on the service of judicial documents by means of public notice is summed up in the Court’s judgment in the case of S.C. Raisa M. Shipping S.R.L. v. Romania (no. 37576/05, § 18, 8 January 2013).
