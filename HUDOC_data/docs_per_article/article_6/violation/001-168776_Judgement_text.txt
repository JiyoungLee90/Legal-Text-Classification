The case originated in an application (no. 50624/09) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Semen Romanovich Kornilov (“the applicant”), on 30 July 2009.
The applicant was represented by Ms Z. Sleptsova, a lawyer practising in Yakutsk. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.
On 18 May 2015 the complaints concerning the length of pre-trial detention and violation of the presumption of innocence were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.
The applicant was born in 1976 and lived, prior to his arrest, in Olekminsk, Sakha (Yakutia) Republic.
On 23 December 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder.
On 25 December 2008 the Olekminskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic remanded the applicant in custody.
On 21 February, 19 March, 18 May, 18 June, 15 August, and 12 September 2009 the court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention and held that despite the fact that he had permanent residence, job and family, he should remain in detention as the investigation was still pending, he could threaten witnesses or re-offend.
On 18 June 2009 the judge stated in his detention order as follows:
“... the circumstances of the case have not changed. [The applicant] ... committed the crime under the influence of alcohol ..., he concealed that he had committed the crime ...”
On 27 November 2009 the court replaced the pre-trial detention with a house arrest.
On 10 June 2010 the Olekminskiy District Court convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to 8 years’ imprisonment. On 10 August 2010 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld his conviction on appeal.
