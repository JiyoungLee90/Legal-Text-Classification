The case originated in an application (no. 35774/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Mr Leontin Nikolayevich Arulepp (“the applicant”), on 6 September 2004.
The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.
On 14 November 2005 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning non-enforcement of a binding judgment to the Government. It also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Panikovichi, a village in the Pskov Region.
As a victim of Chernobyl, the applicant is entitled to benefits. Considering himself underpaid, he sued the local welfare authority.
On 20 November 2002 the Pechorskiy District Court of the Pskov Region awarded the applicant arrears and fixed a new amount of periodic benefits with their subsequent adjustment for the cost of living. This judgment became binding on 24 December 2002.
According to the Government, the judgment was gradually enforced by 7 June 2005. According to the applicant, the judgment was never fully enforced because of improper adjustment for the cost of living. On 27 February 2006 the  recognised that the applicant’s benefits had not been properly adjusted.
Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.
