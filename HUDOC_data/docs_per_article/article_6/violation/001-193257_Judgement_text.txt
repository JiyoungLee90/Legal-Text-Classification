The case originated in an application against Serbia (no. 16019/15) lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Serbian national, Mr Dragoslav Okilj (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2015.
The applicant was represented by Mr S. Radovanović, a lawyer practising in Belgrade. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms N. Plavšić.
On 25 April 2016 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Belgrade.
On 9 May 2005 the applicant lodged a claim seeking ownership of 265 shares of the company Tri Grozda a.d. Beograd
On 14 September 2007 the Belgrade Court of First Instance delivered a judgment in favour of the applicant.
On 13 December 2011 the Belgrade Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of 14 September 2007, and rejected the applicant’s claim.
On 3 April 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time and requesting compensation in that regard.
On 23 September 2014 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time. It held that the finding of a violation had constituted sufficient just satisfaction in the particular circumstances of the present case for the following reasons. First, the nominal value of the impugned shares was only slightly higher than 200 euros. The case was thus of minor importance for the applicant. Secondly, it considered that the applicant had contributed to the length of the civil proceedings by failing to lodge a constitutional appeal earlier.
