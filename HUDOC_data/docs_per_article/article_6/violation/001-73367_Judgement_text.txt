On 8 September 1994 the District Court held a hearing which was adjourned in order to have an expert report drawn up. On 8 November 1994 an expert was appointed.
On 5 May 1995 the court invited the parties to an information meeting scheduled for 29 June 1995. However, the parties did not attend.

On 19 February 1996 the case file was sent to the expert who, in the meantime, had been withdrawn. On 25 March 1996 a new one was appointed. The case file was sent to him on 23 June 1996.

On 10 July 2000 the case was assigned to another judge who, on 20 July 2000, invited the defendant to supplement his appeal. He complied on 20 August 2000. Five days later, the case was sent to the Municipal Court which, however, sent it back with a request to supplement it.
On 7 September 2000 the parties were ordered to pay court fees. On 26 October 2000 the case was again brought to the Municipal Court which, on 16 February 2001, quashed the lower court’s judgment and remitted the case to it for further consideration.
On 1 March 2001 the applicant was invited to amend her action in accordance with the guidelines of the Municipal Court. On 4 April 2001 she objected that the appellate court’s decision was incomprehensible. On 11 April 2001 the court delivered a rectifying resolution. On 4 July 2001 the applicant supplemented her action. On 16 July 2001 the defendant was invited to make his comments. Having been urged to do so on 4 September and 11 October 2001 respectively, he complied on 23 October 2001.
In a judgment of 29 January 2002 the District Court again decided on the distribution of the matrimonial property. On 11 March 2002 both parties appealed. On 19 March 2002 they were invited to supplement their appeals.
