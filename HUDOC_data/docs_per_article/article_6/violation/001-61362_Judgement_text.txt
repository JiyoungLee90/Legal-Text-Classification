The case originated in an application (no. 76446/01) against the Republic of Poland lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Mrs Henryka Malinowska (“the applicant”), on 24 January 2001.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr K. Drzewicki, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 17 December 2002 the Fourth Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. It also gave priority to the application, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court.
The applicant was born in 1914 and lives in Warsaw, Poland.
Facts prior to 1 May 1993
In November and December 1989 the applicant’s neighbours were renovating an attic over her flat and partly removed the roof. As a result, the applicant’s flat was flooded and her belongings were damaged.
