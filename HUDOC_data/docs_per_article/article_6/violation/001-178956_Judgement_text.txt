The case originated in an application (no. 42289/11) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Emre Kök (“the applicant”), on 2 June 2011.
The applicant was represented by Ms T. Çelikyürek, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent.
On 21 November 2016 the complaints concerning the alleged independence and impartiality of the Supreme Military Administrative Court, the fairness of the proceedings before that court on account of the applicant’s inability to access the classified documents submitted by the Ministry of Defence, and the non-communication of the written opinion of the public prosecutor were communicated to the Government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to Rule 54 § 3 of the Rules of Court.
The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Afyonkarahisar.
The applicant, who was a student in the military school, was dismissed from his school based on classified investigation reports. The applicant then initiated proceedings against the Ministry of Defence with the Supreme Military Administrative Court to have annulment of the impugned decision.
.  Relying on the classified investigation reports, and the written opinion of the public prosecutor, which were not communicated to the applicant, on 9 January 2008 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request. On 10 November 2010 the applicant’s request for rectification was also rejected by the Supreme Military Administrative Court.
