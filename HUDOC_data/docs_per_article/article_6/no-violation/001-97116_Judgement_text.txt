The case originated in an application (no. 13791/06) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a German national, Mr Rüdiger Gromzig (“the applicant”), on 29 March 2006.

The applicant alleged that the length of the proceedings had been in breach of the reasonable time requirement laid down in Article 6 § 1.
On 7 October 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 3).
The application was allocated to the Fifth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Renate Jaeger, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the Chamber (Rule 28).

Therefore, when he applied for restitution of the property on 13 and 15 August 1994, the  and Jerichoer Land Offices for the Resolution of Outstanding Property Issues (Amt zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen, “the Dessau Office/Jerichoer Land Office”) rejected his applications because they had been lodged too late.
