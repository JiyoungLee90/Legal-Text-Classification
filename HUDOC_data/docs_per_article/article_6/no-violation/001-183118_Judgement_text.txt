The case originated in an application (no. 24079/11) against the Republic of Croatia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Croatian national, Ms Ivana Jureša (“the applicant”), on 23 March 2011.
The applicant was represented by Mr D. Šuper, a lawyer practising in Osijek. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that she had been deprived of access to the Supreme Court.
On 21 October 2014 the application was communicated to the Government.
The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Osijek.
The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.
On 6 November 2000, in inheritance proceedings following the applicant’s grandmother’s death, the applicant’s relative, M.J., and the applicant’s father were declared the beneficiaries in respect of a house, which was not registered in the land register, by a decision of the Zabok Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zaboku).
On 18 October 2007 M.J. brought a civil action against the applicant in the Zabok Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zaboku) asking that court to recognise his ownership of a share of half of an inherited piece of property and to order the applicant to allow him to register his ownership in the land register. He set the value of the dispute (vrijednost predmeta spora) at 110,000 Croatian kunas (HRK).
In the proceedings before the first-instance court, on 5 November 2007 the applicant contested the value of the dispute and suggested that it be set at HRK 300,000.
At the hearing held on 23 January 2008 the applicant, inter alia, withdrew her objection to the value of the dispute as indicated by the claimant, and stated that she agreed with it.
In its judgment of 25 April 2008 the Zabok Municipal Court accepted M.J.’s claim.
The applicant lodged an appeal with the Zlatar County Court (Županijski sud u Zlataru) and on 16 September 2009 the second-instance court dismissed her appeal as ill-founded, upholding the first-instance judgment.
On 24 November 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), challenging the lower courts’ judgments.
On 27 May 2010 the Supreme Court declared the applicant’s appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris. It interpreted M.J.’s civil action as being composed of two separate claims arising from different factual and legal bases - the first one for recognition of ownership, and the second for obtaining an order securing the registration of his ownership in the land register (hereinafter “the issuance of a clausula intabulandi”). The Supreme Court thus halved the value of the dispute and held that the value of each claim did not reach the necessary ratione valoris threshold of HRK 100,001 (approximately 13,300 euros (EUR)) for an appeal on points of law to be admissible. The relevant part of this decision reads as follows:
“The claimant in his civil action indicated the value of the dispute as HRK 110,000.
Pursuant to section 37(2) of the CPA [(Civil Procedure Act)], if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds, or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute must be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim.
In the instant case the claimant made two non-monetary claims, one concerning property rights - for recognition of ownership -, and a claim under the law on obligations - for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi , namely for obtaining an order securing registration of his ownership in the land register. Therefore, the value of the dispute has to be established in relation to the value of the dispute of each claim. Consequently, the value of the dispute of each claim ... has to be established by dividing the indicated unique value of the dispute by [these] two [claims].
Given that the claimant indicated the [unique] value of the dispute as HRK 110,000, and that this amount should be divided by [the number of the claims], the value of the dispute of each claim does not exceed the amount of 100,000. It follows that an appeal on points of law by the defendant is inadmissible.”
The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), arguing that M.J.’s action had two aspects which could not be separated, and that the Supreme Court’s decision finding that the case concerned two separate claims had therefore been arbitrary and had violated her right to a fair hearing, in particular her right of access to the Supreme Court, as guaranteed under Article 29 of the Constitution.
On 17 February 2011 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint. It held that the applicant in her constitutional complaint “did not demonstrate that the Supreme Court had failed to respect the provisions of the Constitution concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely that it had applied relevant law in an arbitrary manner” and that therefore “the present case did not raise a constitutional issue.” Its decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 3 March 2011.
The relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 112/1999, 81/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 84/2008, 96/2008 and 123/2008), as in force at the material time, provided:
“(1)  When the value of the subject matter of the dispute is relevant for determining subject matter jurisdiction, the composition of the court, the right to lodge an appeal on points of law and in other cases provided for in this Act, only the value of the principal claim shall be taken into account as the value of the dispute ...”
“(1)  When one action against the same defendant includes several claims arising from the same factual and legal basis, the value of the dispute shall be established in line with the sum of values of all the claims.
(2)  When the claims from the action arise from a variety of grounds or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute shall be established in line with the value of each individual claim.”
“...(2)  ... when an action does not concern a sum of money, the relevant value shall be the value of the dispute indicated by the claimant in the statement of claim (u tužbi).”
“(1)  the parties may lodge an appeal on points of law against the second-instance judgment:
If the value of dispute of the contested part of the judgment exceeds HRK 100,000 ...”
The Government referred to case no. U-III-3020/2006 of 26 March 2014 in which the Constitutional Court dismissed as ill-founded a constitutional complaint against the decision of the Supreme Court declaring an appeal on points of law inadmissible ratione valoris because it established the value of the dispute by dividing it by the number of claimants. The relevant part of this decision reads as follows:
“3.  The applicants [lodging the constitutional complaint] consider that the Supreme Court violated their right to a fair hearing, as guaranteed by Article 29(1) of the Constitution, when it established the value of the dispute by dividing it by [the number of] claimants.
...
1.8.  ... The Constitutional Court notes that the case-law of the Supreme Court on this matter is unwavering, established and very consistent. In order for the Constitutional Court to reach, in the circumstances of the instant case, the conclusion that [the case-law], as such, impairs the very essence of the applicants’ right of access to a court, it requires serious, relevant and sufficient arguments to be presented in the constitutional complaint that could convince the Constitutional Court to deviate from the law created by the Supreme Court’s case-law.
1.9.  Having examined the content of the constitutional complaint, the Constitutional Court found that it did not contain [the necessary] serious, relevant and sufficient reasons that would oblige the Constitutional Court to find a violation of the right of access to a court in the present case ...”

For example:
“The case concerns the claimants’ property rights and issuance of a clausula intabulandi. With regard to section 37 of the Civil Procedure Act, when several claimants in a single action seek recognition of co-ownership of property in equal shares, and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi, and they indicate the unique value of the dispute, the admissibility of the appeal on points of law depends on the value of the dispute, which is established by dividing the [indicated unique] value of the dispute by the number of the claimants.”
“The [first-instance court] awarded the two claims brought in one civil action – the first one for the declaration of the sale contract to be null and void ... and the second one for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi ...
... the [unique] value of the dispute, pursuant to section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, has to be divided in half, as there are two claims ...”
“The civil proceedings at issue concern [1] the acquisition of the right of ownership and issuance of a clausula intabulandi and [2] erasing of fiduciary ...
The indicated value of the dispute is HRK 100,001 and the [civil action] contains two claims against the two defendants.
In the light of the foregoing considerations, the value of the dispute of each claim in relation to each defendant [vrijednost predmeta spora svakog pojedinog zahtjeva u odnosu na svakog tuženika] ... does not exceed [the threshold of] HRK 100,000 ...”
“The claimant in the proceedings made two claims, one for the acquisition of ownership and ordering the defendants to allow her to register that ownership [the issuance of a clausula intabulandi] and the other one for the loan agreement to be declared null and void.
Consequently, the indicated value of the dispute has to be established by dividing that value by [these] two claims ... ”
“The second-instance court accepted the appeal by the claimant and reversed the first-instance judgment as follows:
“It is established that the claimant ... is the owner of the property ... [and] the defendants shall recognise this right and issue [the claimant] with a clausula intabulandi for the registration of the property in the land register ...”
Pursuant to section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds, or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute shall be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim.
Given that the civil action was lodged against two defendants ... the value of dispute has to be divided in half ... “
In its decisions nos. Rev-807/08-2 of 1 February 2010, Rev1021/082 of 10 May 2010, Rev-425/09-2 of 27 May 2010, Rev638/10-25 of 13 September 2010, Rev-34/10-2 of 24 September 2010, Rev-697/10-2 of 24 September 2010 and Rev-1417/10-2 of 25 January 2011, the Supreme Court held that civil actions for recognition of ownership and the issuance of a clausula intabulandi were two claims arising from a variety of grounds. For example:
“In the instant case the claimant in her civil action brought a claim concerning property rights for recognition of ownership, and a claim under the law on obligations for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi ...
The indicated value of the dispute is HRK 102,000. Pursuant to section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, the value of the dispute of each claim is HRK 51,000 ...
Given that the value of the claim does not exceed HRK 100,000, pursuant to section 392 of the CPA [(Civil Procedure Act)], an appeal on points of law by the claimant is inadmissible.”
“The claimant ... indicated the value of the dispute as HRK 101,000.
Pursuant to section 37(2) of the Civil Procedure Act, if the claims in the civil action arise from a variety of grounds, or different claimants put forward individual claims or individual claims are raised against several defendants, the value of the dispute must be established in accordance with the value of each individual claim.
In the instant case the claimant made two claims arising from a variety of grounds, namely a claim in rem for recognition of ownership, and a claim under the law on obligations for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi. Therefore, pursuant to section 37(2) of the CPA [(Civil Procedure Act)], the value of the dispute of each claim is HRK 51,500.
Given that the value of the claim does not exceed HRK 100,000, pursuant to section 392(1) of the CPA [(Civil Procedure Act)], an appeal on points of law by the claimant is inadmissible.”
“In his civil action the claimant indicated the value of the dispute as HRK 110,000. The action was lodged against two defendants and contains two claims, namely a claim concerning property rights [claim in rem] and a claim under the law on obligations for the issuance of a clausula intabulandi [claim in personam]. Each of these [two] claims has been brought against two defendants ... Given that the claimant indicated the value of the dispute as HRK 110,000, this amount should be divided by the [number] of the claims and by the [number] of defendants. It follows that the [value of the dispute] of each claim against each defendant individually does not exceed the amount of 100,000.”
