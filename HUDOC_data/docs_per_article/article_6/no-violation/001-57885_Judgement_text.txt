The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights ("the Commission") on 12 July 1993, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 14804/89) against the  lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Italian national, Mr Manlio Vendittelli, on 11 January 1989.
The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby  recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).
In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).
The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr C. Russo, the elected judge of Italian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr J. De Meyer, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou and Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr B. Walsh, substitute judge, replaced Mr De Meyer, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).
As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Italian Government ("the Government"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 8 December 1993. In a letter of 7 October 1993 the applicant’s lawyer had said that he would not be filing a memorial. The Delegate of the Commission did not make any observations in writing.
On 10 November 1993 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions.
In accordance with the decision of the President, who had given the applicant leave to use the Italian language (Rule 27 para. 3), the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, , on 21 February 1994. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.
There appeared before the Court:
- for the Government
- for the Commission
- for the applicant
The Court heard addresses by them and also replies to its questions.
In letters of 10 and 14 March 1994 the Government provided additional information.
Mr Manlio Vendittelli, an architect, lives in .
On 19 May 1986 the  municipal police (vigili urbani) sealed his flat, on the ground that he had infringed the town-planning regulations.
On 20 May 1986 the  magistrate (pretore) confirmed the sequestration (sequestro) and criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant. Mr Vendittelli lodged three applications for release of his property from sequestration on 30 May 1986 and 5 and 26 June 1987 but they were dismissed on 12 June 1986 and 9 July 1987 for reasons of prevention and of preservation of evidence (per fini preventivi e cautelari).
On 25 July 1987 the applicant sought an early hearing, pointing to the damage caused him by his being unable to enjoy the benefit of his property. The trial was initially set down for 17 November 1987 but was postponed to 15 December 1987.
In a judgment delivered the same day, which was filed in the registry on 30 December 1987 and notified on 1 December 1988, the magistrate imposed on Mr Vendittelli, who was present when the judgment was delivered, a suspended sentence of twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of ten million lire, without any entry in the criminal records, for having carried out works in his flat without a permit from the mayor (concessione edilizia).
The applicant appealed against this decision within three days of its delivery and filed his pleadings on 10 December 1988; the twenty-day period allowed for filing grounds of appeal began to run on the day of service of the judgment. The hearing in the Rome Court of Appeal began on 2 May 1989. It was adjourned on 8 January and 27 March 1990 - on the first occasion at the request of Mr Vendittelli, whose doctor had ordered him to rest for five days, and on the second occasion because his counsel was unable to attend. In the meantime, on 13 January 1990, the lawyer had already applied for the trial to be resumed.
In a judgment of 4 July 1990, which was filed in the registry on the same day and became final  and therefore enforceable  on 30 October 1990, the Court of Appeal held that the offence had been amnestied and the prosecution barred as a result of a presidential decree that had been issued on 12 April 1990. It did not, however, order that the property should be released from sequestration, nor was the judgment notified to the applicant, who had to obtain a copy from the registry on 5 December 1990. In the meantime, by a letter of 19 July 1990, Mr Vendittelli had applied for a hearing to be fixed.
On 19 November 1990 the file was sent to the magistrate for placing in the archives. In a letter of 10 December 1990 to the President of the Rome Court of Appeal, which was sent on 17 December to the magistrate’s court (pretura), the applicant again sought to have his property released from sequestration. He complained of the bad state of his flat.
On 17 December the registrar of the magistrate’s court sent the file to the magistrate for execution of the judgment, that is to say release from sequestration. On 31 January 1991 the magistrate held that he had no jurisdiction and ordered that the file should be returned to the Court of Appeal.
It arrived the next day. The central registry of the Court of Appeal recorded the point raised regarding execution (incidente di esecuzione) and on 11 February 1991 sent the file to the registry of the Second Criminal Division. On 10 April and 9 May 1991 Mr Vendittelli again sought to have his property released from sequestration.
In an order of 17 May 1991, which was filed on 21 May, sent to  on 23 May "for execution of what was ordered in it" and served on the applicant on 3 June, the Rome Court of Appeal allowed Mr Vendittelli’s application and also noted that the mayor had issued a permit in the meantime.
Mr Vendittelli applied to the Commission on 11 January 1989. He complained of the length of the criminal proceedings against him (Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention) (art. 6-1) and of an infringement of his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions arising from the length of the proceedings and from the continued sequestration of his flat after the Rome Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 July 1990 (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1).
The Commission declared the application (no. 14804/89) admissible on 14 October 1992. In its report of 31 March 1993 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that
(a)  there had been a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention by reason of the excessive length of the proceedings;
(b)  it was unnecessary to state its opinion on the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) relating to the length of the criminal proceedings; and
(c)  there had been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) on account of the failure to remove the seals after the judgment of the Court of Appeal.
The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.
