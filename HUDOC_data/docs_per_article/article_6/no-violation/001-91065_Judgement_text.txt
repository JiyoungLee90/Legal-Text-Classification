The case originated in an application (no. 16828/02) against the  lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Polish national, Michał Kupiec (“the applicant”), on 2 April 2001.
The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wolasiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The applicant alleged, in particular, that he had been deprived of his right of access to a court, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention.
On 5 September 2006 the President of the Fourth Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility (Article 29 § 3).
The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Kraków.
On 19 June 2000 the aplicant sued three professors from the Cracow University of Science and Technology (Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza) before the  (Sąd Okręgowy) alleging professional misconduct on their part and seeking protection of his personal rights. He submitted that the professors had deliberately made him fail his fourth year of studies. They allegedly prohibited him from participation in lectures and the examinations. In this respect he claimed PLN 400,000 in compensation from the professors and PLN 1,000,000 from the University.
On 8 October 2000 the aplicant submitted information concerning his financial situation. He maintained that he received a family pension in the amount of PLN 322. He further stressed that he was a student, that he did not work and that he had incurred huge debts on his bank account (several thousand Polish zlotys).
On 20 October 2000 the  asked the aplicant to submit a copy of his bank statement and the contract for the purchase of his car. In reply, on 23 October 2000 the aplicant sent a letter to the court, claiming that his debts amounted to PLN 17,323. However, he could not ask the bank for a statement because the bank would have discovered his debts. He was also not able to submit the contract for the purchase of his car (Renault Clio) as it had been bought with his mother’s money.
On 3 November 2000 the  refused to exempt the aplicant from the payment of court fees. The court held that the aplicant had failed to submit evidence i.e. his bank statement in suport of his allegations that he had substantial debts. According to the court, the fact that the aplicant owned a Renault Clio was an indication that his financial situation was sound. The court stressed that it was impossible to cover the costs of the car maintenance with the applicant’s pension.
On 13 December 2000 the aplicant lodged an interlocutory apeal. He stressed that the court fee for lodging his claim exceeded PLN 75,000, which he was unable to pay. He further maintained that he did not own any real estate and that he rented his apartment under the rent-control scheme. Moreover, he was not even able to pay the reduced rent and he already owed PLN 3,670.45 to the housing co-operative. He further claimed that the fact that he owned a car was of no relevance as he had bought it two years ago when his financial situation had been better, given that he had had a part-time job at the time. He did not have a copy of the contract for the purchase of the car. However, he maintained that he had bought a new car and had paid PLN 30,900 for it.
On 14 December 2000 the  again refused the aplicant’s request. The court stressed that the fact that the aplicant owned a car worth PLN 40,000 and at the same time his only income was a family pension of PLN 323 indicated that his financial situation was good and that he must have had some hidden resources. Otherwise, he would not be able to suport himself and to maintain his car. According to the court, the aplicant was trying to conceal his real financial situation.
On 4 January 2001 the aplicant lodged an interlocutory apeal against this decision. He claimed that the court’s refusal to exempt him amounted to a violation of his right of access to a court.
On 22 January 2001 the Krakow Court of Apeal dismissed the aplicant’s interlocutory apeal. The court held that a person aplying for legal aid should not take out a loan in a situation when he still had assets (a car). In addition, the aplicant had failed to provide a detailed statement about his financial situation.
On 15 February 2001 the  ordered the aplicant to pay PLN 29,100 as a fee for lodging his statement of claim on pain of having his claim returned.
On 25 February 2001 the aplicant again asked to be exempted from the court fees. He claimed that he was unable to pay that amount. He owed PLN 20,000 to the bank and had no savings. In addition, his claim related to the protection of personal rights. As regards his car, he could not sell it since a different set of civil proceedings concerning it was pending. Lastly, he maintained that apart from the family pension - PLN 326 - he did not have any other income. He had no possessions and the car was his only asset.
On 3 A the  refused the aplicant’s request. The court held that the aplicant should have sold his car in order to obtain money for court fees.
On 18 A the aplicant again lodged an interlocutory apeal against this decision. The aplicant repeated his earlier arguments and referred to the right of access to a court.
On 21 May 2001 the Court of Apeal gave a decision and exempted the aplicant from 80 % of the court fees for lodging his statement of claim. The court found that the court fee in the amount of PLN 29,100 constituted a limitation on the aplicant’s right of access to a court and that the amount had to be reduced. At the same time, it held that a court fee in the amount of 5,820 PLN could not be considered excessive for the aplicant.
On 13 July 2001 the aplicant again made an interlocutory apeal and submitted that PLN 5,820 was too much and he was unable to pay it.
On 16 July 2001 the  refused to grant the aplicant any further exemption from court fees. Upon the aplicant’s further apeal, the Krakow Court of Apeal upheld the decision on 23 October 2001. The court held that the aplicant had not submitted any new arguments which would have justified a further exemption from court fees.
On 7 January 2002 the  ordered the aplicant to pay a court fee of PLN 5,820 for lodging his statement of claim on pain of having the claim returned.
On 14 January 2002 the aplicant lodged yet another motion for an exemption from court fees. He stated among other things that he had lost the right to a family pension.
On 18 January 2002 the  returned the statement of claim to the aplicant as he had failed to pay the required court fee. On 4 March 2002 the  quashed the decision to return the statement of claim to the aplicant. On the same date it dismissed the aplicant’s motion for an exemption. It held that there were no new circumstances which would argue in favour of allowing the applicant’s request. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal.
On 15 May 2002 the Court of Apeal dismissed the aplicant’s interlocutory apeal. The court held that the aplicant had already been exempted from the greater part of the fees due in his case (80 %) and that he only had to pay PLN 5,820. Furthermore, despite his allegedly bad financial situation, the aplicant had been able to maintain a car. The court acknowledged that the car was the subject of enforcement proceedings. However, since the aplicant had not been able over a two-year period to set aside the sum required for court fees, his aplication for an exemption had to be dismissed.
On 31 July 2002 the  returned the statement of claim to the applicant since he had failed to pay the required court fee. The applicant appealed.
On 13 September 2002 the court ordered the aplicant to pay the court fee of PLN 1,164 for lodging an interlocutory apeal. On 30 Se the aplicant asked to be exempted from payment of this fee.
On 2 October 2002 the court asked the aplicant to submit a detailed statement about his financial situation.
On 19 November 2002 the  exempted the aplicant from the fee for lodging his interlocutory apeal.
On 6 March 2003 the Court of Apeal dismissed the aplicant’s interlocutory apeal against the decision to return the statement of claim to him.
