which was in force until september the minimum wage in azerbaijan was azn the relevant extracts of resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe the honouring of obligations and commitments by azerbaijan read as follows regrettably there is no political dialogue with the opposition parties outside parliament the assembly is concerned by the restrictive climate for the activities of the extra-parliamentary opposition which complains about limitations imposed on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the lack of access to the public media the establishment of an inclusive political system and a truly competitive and unrestrictive political environment requires full implementation of basic freedoms including freedom of expression freedom of assembly and freedom of association the situation in azerbaijan is preoccupying and the assembly expresses its deep concern in this regard recently adopted amendments to the criminal code and the administrative code which have increased penalties for the organisers of and participants in unauthorised gatherings raise concern considering the authorities ongoing blanket ban on protests in the baku city centre these amendments are likely to have a further negative impact on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression the restrictive use of certain articles of the criminal code in particular articles and against participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised demonstrations is another matter of concern the relevant extracts of the report commdh of august by nils muižnieks the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe following his visit to azerbaijan from to may read as follows the commissioner is deeply concerned by the recent amendments to the law on freedom of assembly the criminal code and the code of administrative offences which further erode the right to freedom of assembly the sanctions which can now be imposed coupled with the fact that local authorities have not authorised a single rally in baku city centre in recent years clearly have a chilling effect on the organisation of or participation in demonstrations the commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question provided they do not do anything illegal violent or obscene in the course of it the commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly is imposed for a summary of other relevant provisions concerning administrative proceedings the relevant provisions concerning organisation and holding of public assemblies and the relevant extracts of international documents see the judgment in the case of gafgaz mammadov v. azerbaijan no october,case originated two applications nos republic azerbaijan lodged court article convention protection human rights

and assaulted by turkish military personnel and/or other personnel acting under turkish control the beating was inflicted with electrical batons by or policemen all over the applicant s body in particular the head and back one of the blows caused a painful injury to the applicant s right arm and elbow with loss of blood she was then dragged to a small stiflingly hot room in which other demonstrators were also being held one of the prisoners had been severely beaten and was unconscious the applicant and the other detainees were subsequently led through a hostile crowd that spat and swore at them to a bus that was waiting to take them to the so-called pavlides garage as she entered the garage her handbag was seized she was forced to sit on the floor the toilet facilities were filthy a crowd that had gathered outside the garage was swearing shouting abuse and threats and throwing stones some of which came through the corrugated iron roof one of the detainees a doctor treated the applicant s arm which was still bleeding with whatever he had to hand and bandaged it one of the female prisoners mrs vrahimi see application no was then beaten in front of the others who remained silent fearing for their own fate a woman shouted that she was an american citizen and was released shortly afterwards while in the garage the applicant was interrogated but refused to sign the statement which was written in turkish the interrogation took place in greek and touched mainly on political subjects the next day july she and the other detainees were given food and at the same time photographed and filmed by a television crew later that day after being subjected to a body search the applicant was taken to a court which remanded her in custody for two days she was transferred with other women who had been arrested at the same time to the ortakeuy prison where she was held in a cell with another woman the conditions of detention were appalling the cell was unbearably hot and during the night the applicant and the other detainees were constantly checked and counted by the guards and as a result were unable to sleep the applicant went on hunger strike during the evening of july the applicant was taken to the nicosia district court for trial the judge asked her and the other accused whether they wanted legal representation they replied that they would only accept as defence counsel a lawyer registered with the bar association of the as a result they were not assisted by a lawyer the interpretation into greek was poor and did not cover all the words used by the witnesses and the parties each time an accused tried to speak and give an explanation she was interrupted although the applicant had never previously seen some of the exhibits that were produced at the trial notably a pair of scissors gloves and a saw one of the prosecution witnesses said that he had found a penknife in her handbag the applicant alleged that she had taken it with her to peel an apple and that the blade was not even two inches long she tried to explain the position to the judge but was not allowed to she showed her bandaged arm in order to complain about the beating she had suffered but an officer replied that she could have injured herself by falling down after the trial the applicant was taken back to prison on july the court ordered the applicant to enter into a recognizance of turkish liras as a guarantee that she would not commit further breaches of the peace for a period of one year the trial judge noted that it was the second time the applicant had illegally entered trnc territory most of the accused including the applicant were also sentenced to days imprisonment and a fine of cypriot pounds cyp approximately euros eur with five additional days in prison in default of payment within hours after the public delivery of the judgment they were returned to prison on july the applicant was released and taken by bus to southern as a result of the beating described above three of the applicant s vertebrae were damaged the doctors told her that the condition of her central nerve was continuously deteriorating and that no surgery could be carried out the government alleged that the applicant had participated in a violent demonstration with the aim of enflaming anti-turkish sentiment the demonstrators supported by the greek-cypriot administration were demanding that the green line in should be dismantled some carried greek flags clubs knives and wire-cutters they were acting in a provocative manner and shouting abuse the demonstrators were warned in greek and english that unless they dispersed they would be arrested in accordance with the laws of the trnc the applicant was arrested by the turkish-cypriot police after crossing the un buffer zone and entering the area under turkish-cypriot control the turkish-cypriot police intervened in the face of the manifest inability of the greek-cypriot authorities and the un force in to contain the incursion and its possible consequences no force was used against demonstrators who did not intrude into the trnc border area and in the case of demonstrators who were arrested for violating the border no more force was used than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances in order to arrest and detain the persons concerned no one was ill-treated it was possible that some of the demonstrators had hurt themselves in the confusion or in attempting to scale barbed wire or other fencing had the turkish police or anyone else assaulted or beaten any of the demonstrators the un secretary general would no doubt have referred to this in his report to the security council the applicant was charged tried found guilty and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment she pleaded not guilty but did not give evidence and declined to use the available judicial remedies she was asked if she required assistance from a lawyer registered in the trnc but refused and did not ask for legal representation interpretation services were provided at the trial by qualified interpreters all the proceedings were translated into greek in his report of december on the un operations in the un secretary general stated inter alia a serious situation however arose in july as a result of a demonstration by greek cypriots in the details are as follows a in the evening of july some greek cypriot demonstrators mostly women forced their way into the un buffer zone in the ayios kassianos area of the demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by unficyp and destroyed an unficyp observation post they then broke through the line formed by unficyp soldiers and entered a former school complex where unficyp reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further a short while later turkish-cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended persons of them women b the ayios kassianos school complex is situated in the un buffer zone however the turkish forces claim it to be on their side of the cease-fire line under working arrangements with unficyp the turkish-cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions this patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last may c in the afternoon of july some greek cypriots gathered at the main entrance to the un protected area in in which the un headquarters is located to protest the continuing detention by the turkish-cypriot authorities of those apprehended at ayios kassianos the demonstrators whose number fluctuated between and blocked all un traffic through this entrance until july when the turkish-cypriot authorities released the last two detainees d the events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made both at the un headquarters and at to contain and resolve the situation on july i expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the un buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated i also urged the turkish-cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained on july the president of the security council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties on behalf of the members of the council the council s deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of july he also stressed the need strictly to respect the un buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained he asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations. the applicant produced photographs taken at different times during the demonstration on july photographs to were intended to show that notwithstanding the deployment of the turkish-cypriot police the demonstration was peaceful in photographs to members of the turkish-cypriot police are seen breaking up the unficyp cordon the final set of photographs show members of the turkish-cypriot police using force to arrest some of the women demonstrators the english translation of the nicosia district court judgment of july indicates that the applicant together with other women was charged with two offences entering trnc territory without permission contrary to sections and of law no see paragraph below and entering trnc territory other than through an approved port contrary to subsections and of the aliens and immigration law see paragraph below the judgment was given in the presence of the accused and of an interpreter the trial judge noted the following i the accused did not accept the charges against them and stated that they did not wish to use the services of a lawyer registered in the trnc ii some of the accused had fainted during the trial and had been taken to hospital and excused from attending the hearing iii the public prosecutor called witnesses whose statements were translated into greek for the accused s benefit iv the witnesses mainly police officers on duty at the time of the demonstration declared that the accused had illegally entered the trnc buffer zone shouted abuse at the turkish-cypriot forces resisted arrest by pulling and pushing knives and other cutting objects had been found in the bags of some of the demonstrators who had been arrested in particular the witnesses declared that the demonstrators had passed the barriers at the un observation post broken the wooden door of a church and moved toward a water reservoir according to a map shown at trial the area where the accused had entered was trnc territory v the accused did not call any defence witnesses and did not address the court vi the accused had been told that they could cross-examine witnesses in turn and if they so wished choose one of their number to cross-examine the witnesses on behalf of all the accused however they had not done so vii relying on the statements of the prosecution witnesses the district court came to the conclusion that the accused had crossed the borders of the trnc at an unapproved entry point and without permission and had resisted by various means the un and turkish forces which had tried to stop them viii the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt so that the accused were guilty on both counts ix in deciding on the sentence the district court took into account the seriousness of the offence and the fact that the accused had shown no remorse and continued to deny the validity of the trnc section of the cypriot criminal code reads as follows where five or more persons assembled with intent to commit an offence or being assembled with intent to carry out some common purpose conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace or will by such assembly needlessly and without any reasonable occasion provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace they are an unlawful assembly it is immaterial that the original assembling was lawful if being assembled they conduct themselves with a common purpose in such a manner as aforesaid when an unlawful assembly has begun to execute the purpose whether of a public or of a private nature for which it assembled by a breach of the peace and to the terror of the public the assembly is called a riot and the persons assembled are said to be riotously assembled. according to section of the criminal code any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to imprisonment for one year section of the criminal code provides any person who carries in public without lawful occasion any offensive arm or weapon in such a manner as to cause terror to any person is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years and his arm or weapons shall be forfeited. according to section of the criminal code it is an offence to carry a knife outside the home the relevant part of chapter section of the criminal procedure law states any officer may without warrant arrest any person b who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment c who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty section of law no states any person who enters a prohibited military area without authorization or by stealth or fraudulently shall be tried by a military court in accordance with the military offences act those found guilty shall be punished subsections and of the aliens and immigration law read as follows no person shall enter or leave the colony except through an approved port any person who contravenes or fails to observe any of the provisions of

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on december within the three-month period laid down by article para and article art art of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention it originated in an application no against lodged with the commission under article art by a swedish national mr rolf langborger on september the commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the object of the request was to obtain a decision from the court as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and art art art art of the convention and article of protocol no in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of the rules of court the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the court and designated the person who would represent him rule the chamber to be constituted included ex officio mr g. lagergren the elected judge of swedish nationality article of the convention art and mr r. ryssdal the president of the court rule para b on january in the presence of the registrar the president drew by lot the names of the other five members namely mr j. cremona mr thór vilhjámsson mr j. pinheiro farinha mr l.-e. pettiti and mr j. gersing article in fine of the convention and rule para art subsequently mrs d. bindschedler-robert substitute judge and the newly elected judge of swedish nationality mrs e. palm who took up her duties before the hearing replaced respectively mr gersing who had died and mr lagergren who had resigned article of the convention and rules para para and para art mr ryssdal assumed the office of president of the chamber rule para and through the registrar consulted the agent of the swedish government the government the delegate of the commission and the applicant s representative on the need for a written procedure rule para in accordance with the order made in consequence the registry received the applicant s memorial on may and the government s memorial on may in a letter which reached the registry on june the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would submit his observations at the hearing having consulted through the registrar those who would be appearing before the court the president directed on december that the oral proceedings should open on february rule on january the chamber decided under rule to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary court the hearing took place in public in the on the appointed day the court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr corell for the government by sir basil hall for the commission and by mr grennberg for the applicant as well as their replies to its questions the commission and the government lodged documents on february and march respectively mr rolf langborger is a swedish national born in he is a consultant engineer and resides at solna a town in the immediate vicinity of on october he rented an apartment the lease contained a negotiation clause förhandlingsklausul see paragraph below which was worded as follows during the running of the lease the parties undertake to accept without prior termination of the lease the rent and other conditions agreed upon on the basis of the negotiation agreement förhandlingsordning in force between on the one hand a landlords union affiliated to the swedish federation of property owners sveriges fastighetsägareförbund and a landlord who with his property is affiliated to such a union and on the other hand a tenants union affiliated to the national tenants union hyresgästernas riksförbund an agreement between the two unions laid down the negotiating procedure for conducting the negotiations the tenants union in question received a commission of of the rent see paragraph below the applicant was dissatisfied with the rent and with the fact that he was represented by the tenants union of the greater stockholm area hyresgästföreningen i stor-stockholm the tenants union he therefore gave notice of his intention to terminate the lease in accordance with chapter section of the land act jordabalken with a view to having its terms altered he proposed to the landlord the conclusion of a new agreement with a fixed rent and no negotiation clause following the rejection of his offer he brought the dispute before the rent review board hyresnämnden for on june in accordance with the legislation in force see paragraph below the section of the rent review board which examined the case was composed of a chairman and two lay assessors intresseledamöter at the time of his appointment the chairman mr göran hogebrandt held a non-permanent judicial appointment as an associate judge in the court of appeal the two assessors who were nominated respectively by the swedish federation of property owners and the national tenants union were experts on the administration of apartment buildings and on the problems of tenants one mr jan åke hedin the managing director of his own electricity business was also the president of one of the district associations affiliated to the stockholm landlords union stockholms fastighetsägareförening the landlords union the other mr gösta gröndahl a retired customs official was a member of the tenants union and had previously been the president of one of the district associations for nine years the applicant first challenged the two lay assessors because they had been nominated by a landlords association and a tenants organisation see paragraph below he considered that they could not decide his case objectively and impartially because the tenants union depended for its existence on the sums paid to it for conducting the rent negotiations see paragraph last sub-paragraph below and the landlords union also derived a major part of its raison d être from its participation in these negotiations in addition he claimed that there was a risk of discrimination on political grounds because the tenants union was socialist in outlook whereas he was a local elected representative belonging to a moderate right wing grouping as regards the merits he sought the deletion of the negotiation clause from the lease and contested the amount of the rent on november the rent review board held a hearing at which the applicant and his representative and the landlord s representative were present the chairman dismissed the applicant s challenge because the rules governing the appointment of the lay assessors did not in themselves provide a ground for such a challenge and because there were no other grounds on which it could be based after having heard the views of the parties as to the merits of the case the rent review board went on to state that its decision would be available at its secretariat on december on that date it dismissed mr langborger s claims its decision which was communicated to him through the post referred inter alia to the declarations of the competent minister during the examination of the rent negotiation bill see paragraph below regarding the discretion conferred on rent review boards in deciding whether negotiation clauses should be retained mr langborger appealed from this decision to the housing and tenancy court bostadsdomstolen he relied on articles and art art art of the convention and sought a thorough examination of the challenge which he had submitted at first instance he also challenged the lay assessors of this court as to the merits he repeated his claim that he should not be represented by the tenants union and that he should be permitted to fix his rent in direct negotiations with the landlord the court which examined the applicant s appeal was composed of four members see paragraph below the president mr hans svahn had until his appointment to the housing and tenancy court presided over a chamber of the svea court of appeal and still retained this post on a formal basis while exercising his new function the other lawyer who acted as rapporteur mr hans anderberg remained a rent judge see paragraph below the two lay assessors had like the assessors sitting on the rent review board been nominated by respectively the swedish federation of property owners and the national tenants union see paragraph below one was an expert on the administration of apartment buildings and the other on tenants problems the first mr bertil tullberg was a titular lay assessor before retiring he had worked for the stockholm landlords union as legal adviser from and then as its managing director the second mrs märta kåremo was a salaried official of the national tenants union where she was responsible for staff legal training she sat on the housing and tenancy court as a substitute lay assessor the landlord of the flat was represented by the same official of the landlords union who had assisted him before the rent review board see paragraph above on december the housing and tenancy court informed mr langborger by letter that it considered that it might determine the case as it was constituted at present and without a hearing on february the rapporteur rejected the application challenging the two lay assessors the rules governing their appointment could not in themselves constitute valid grounds for their disqualification on april the housing and tenancy court dismissed the remainder of mr langborger s appeal and upheld the rent review board s decision it gave its ruling in private in the absence of the parties and without having held a hearing its decision was final the applicant received a photocopy of this decision through the post on april he obtained a copy of the decision of february which by error had not yet been sent to him section of the rent negotiation act hyresförhandlingslagen the act defines the negotiation clause as a provision in a lease whereby the tenant agrees to be bound by the terms of the lease in particular regarding the rent as accepted by the association conducting the negotiations it provides that this clause is introduced or retained if this is not unreasonable having regard to the tenant s standard of living and his opinion and to the opinion of other tenants affected by the clause a dispute regarding the insertion or retention of a negotiation clause may be submitted to a rent review board according to the preparatory documents this possibility was introduced to provide legal protection for private individuals in particular those who were not members of the organisations which participated in the negotiations the board may exempt the party concerned from the obligation to accept a negotiation clause in deciding whether to do so it must inter alia weigh the interest in adopting a rational approach to rent negotiations against the fundamental need for the greatest possible contractual freedom for the individual government bill no p. et seq. section provides that these conditions are to be negotiated between on the one hand the landlord or the landlord and a landlords organisation and on the other hand a tenants organisation the tenant who therefore has no right to negotiate need not be a member of the organisation under section the system applies in principle to all the flats in a building these negotiations which must be conducted in the manner laid down in the act are not compulsory but depend on the desiderata of the parties if one of them refuses to conclude an agreement the dispute may be referred to the rent review board under section the rent may incorporate the amount a percentage of the rent agreed in the negotiations payable to the tenants organisation for its role in these negotiations the principal advantage which the landlords associations derive from the system is that they only have to negotiate rents with the tenants organisations and not with the individual tenants for their part the tenants organisations can exert through their right to represent the tenants a continuous and durable influence on the conditions of the market in rental accommodation at present this system applies to all accommodation owned by public organisations and to of privately owned buildings comprising more than two flats rent review boards were set up by the lease review boards and rent review boards act lag om arrendenämnder och hyresnämnder the act they hear inter alia disputes on rents arising in connection with the provisions of chapter of the land act under section each rent review board is composed of a chairman referred to as a rent judge and two lay assessors one of whom must be familiar with the problems of the administration of property and the other with those of tenants the chairman is appointed by the government or by an authority delegated by them on the recommendation which is always requested except in three specific cases of the judicial appointments recommendation board tjänsteförslagsnämnd he must have legal training and his post is full-time the lay assessors are appointed by the national board of the judiciary domstolsverket for a term of office of three years which is generally renewed under section para of the act the representative organisations of the housing sector essentially the swedish federation of property owners and the national tenants union must be able to put forward candidates when the appointment to be made concerns their interest group the persons selected sit in a personal capacity and not as the representatives of their organisations the lay assessors are not designated in advance for each case but carry out their functions in accordance with a prepared schedule their duties are not full-time in addition if a board has several sections cases are in practice allocated on a geographical basis in principle proceedings before a rent review board are oral they are governed by the general provisions of the administrative act förvaltningslagen although the code of judicial procedure applies for certain formalities the board s decisions must contain a statement of reasons and be given in public they are pronounced on the day of the hearing or within two weeks thereof at the latest a copy is sent to the parties the housing and tenancy court was set up by an act of lag om bostadsdomstol the act and has jurisdiction for the whole of it hears appeals lodged against the decisions of the rent review boards its judgments are final the court is composed of at least three lawyers housing judges a technical assessor who in certain cases replaces one of the lawyers and a maximum of twelve lay assessors all the members are appointed by the government for a term of office of three years which is renewable the lawyer members are in general judges while the lay assessors are experts on the housing market an identical nomination procedure to that operating for the appointment of lay assessors to rent review boards see paragraph above applies the court is always presided over by a lawyer it can sit with seven members or as in this instance with four in the latter case there must be two housing judges and two lay assessors if they are unable to reach a majority decision the president has a casting vote the proceedings are written but a hearing may be held if that appears to be necessary for the purposes of the investigation in some cases argument is taken on a specific point while in others it concerns the case as a whole the housing and tenancy court applies the general provisions of the code of judicial procedure except in certain cases which are not relevant here its judgments are given in public if the court can not give a decision at a hearing it makes the text thereof available to the parties at the registry and communicates to them a copy by post the supreme court högsta domstolen has had occasion to rule on the independence and impartiality of a lay assessor who had to sit in a case involving the association which had nominated him judgment of september case no ö hyresgästföreningen kroken in nytt juridiskt arkiv nja p. it held that there was no ground for allowing the challenge the supreme court first considered the lay assessors position in general it pointed out that their presence was designed to ensure that there were persons on the court who are well acquainted with the questions with which the court has to deal and who can in an authoritative way express the ideas of the interest groups concerned it held that the fact that a member generally speaking represents a certain interest group does not mean that he is biased when dealing with a case where one of the parties belongs to this interest group as was stressed in the preparatory documents nja ii p. it is not intended that the lay assessors in their capacity as judges should feel bound by the interests which they can be said to represent they should like the other members carry out their duties as independent judges and not as representatives of party interests turning then to the case at hand it rejected the challenge which was based on the viewpoint that every member who is closely linked to the tenants movement for that reason alone is biased when dealing with such a case in setting out its reasoning the supreme court said inter alia it should first be pointed out that it is not the task of the lay assessors of the housing and tenancy court to represent their organisations they should represent the whole interest group in question without regard to their involvement in a particular organisation the legislation is obviously based on the assumption that the lay assessors will be able to deal impartially with disputes even where the interests of their organisation are directly at issue and it is not compatible with the provisions of the act generally to regard members attached to an organisation as biased in such disputes the court added however there may of course be grounds for challenging a member of the court if he has been involved in the dispute before the court mr langborger s application to the commission no was lodged on september he alleged that he had not been given a public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal he also complained of a breach of his rights to respect for his home his freedom of association and enjoyment of his possessions and of the lack of an effective remedy before a national authority he relied on articles para and art art art art of the convention and article of protocol no the commission found the application admissible on july in its report of october article art it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a failure to comply with the requirements of article para art of the convention regarding impartiality there had been no violation of articles and art art of the convention and article of protocol no it was not necessary to consider separately the complaint based on article art of the convention nor to determine whether there had been a failure to observe article para art as regards the requirement of a public hearing and a public pronouncement of the judgment the full text of the commission s opinion is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment at the hearing on february the government confirmed their

the case originated in an application no against the republic of bulgaria lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the united macedonian organisation ilinden ilinden an organisation based in southwest bulgaria in an area known as the pirin region or the geographic region of pirin macedonia and by thirteen bulgarian nationals mr boris georgiev pavlov mr bozhidar kostadinov kiryanov mr boris dimitrov kereziev mr yordan kostadinov ivanov mr lyubcho kirilov popchev mr ivan timchev ivanov mr georgi stefanov andonov mr kiril serafimov tilev mr velik dimitrov hristovski mr slavcho vangelov barakov mr aleksandar velev manchev mr atanas dimitrov urdev and mr yordan sotirov alekov the applicants on september the applicants were represented by the bulgarian helsinki committee the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agent ms m. dimova of the ministry of justice the applicants alleged in particular that the refusal to register ilinden was unlawful and unwarranted that the registration proceedings were unfair and that those matters were a result of their asserted macedonian ethnicity which the was refusing to recognise on june the president of the fifth section to which the case had been allocated decided to give priority to the application under rule of the rules of court and to conduct the proceedings in the case simultaneously with those in united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v. bulgaria no no singartiyski and others v. bulgaria no and united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others v. no nos and rule former of the rules of court on september the court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaints concerning the fairness of the registration proceedings the interference with the applicants right to freedom of association and the alleged discrimination in the enjoyment of the applicants convention rights to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article of the convention following the recomposition of the court s sections on february the application was transferred to the fourth section the individual applicants were born in and and live in krupnik sandanski gotse delchev ilindentsi katuntsi kamena petrich and kolarovo they are all members of ilinden s managing council the relevant background circumstances are described in detail in paragraphs of the court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria no january on october a group of one hundred and eleven supporters of ilinden held a meeting at which they resolved to form a non-profit association they adopted its articles and elected its bodies including thirteen members of its managing council clause of the articles which defined the association s goals said inter alia that ilinden was a successor and continuer of the national liberation struggle of the macedonian nation including the macedonian fighters who fell victim to bulgarian state terrorism and genocide clause specified that ilinden recognise d and respect ed the territorial integrity of the republic of bulgaria and its laws and constitution but only if they were consonant with international law and international agreements on human rights fundamental freedoms and minorities rights clauses and stated that ilinden s goals included expressing and defending the civil national social and economic rights of the macedonians who live on macedonian soil under bulgarian occupation jurisdiction and of the macedonians who live in bulgaria and requesting cultural autonomy status for pirin in order for the assimilation process to be stopped clause to of the articles provided that to attain its goals ilinden would propagate macedonian culture and traditions hold meetings to commemorate historical dates nominate macedonians for members of parliament petition the government and various international institutions for the national rights of the macedonians and organise conferences and seminars clause said that the association would be run and represented by a managing council according to clause it would have three to seven members however clause specified that the first managing council would have three members on october ilinden applied for registration to the in a judgment of november the court refused to register the association it gave the following reasons the evidence shows that the activities of the organisation seeking registration are directed against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation this is apparent from the association s main goals and the means for attaining them their wording shows their political character the organisation says that it is a successor of and continues the ‘ national liberation struggle of the macedonian nation including the ‘ macedonian fighters who fell victim to terrorism and genocide its articles of association specify that the organisation will respect the territorial integrity of the republic of bulgaria but only if ‘ it is consistent with international law and international agreements on human rights fundamental freedoms and the rights of minorities that the organisation will ‘ express and safeguard the civil social and economic rights of the macedonians who live on macedonian soil under bulgarian occupation jurisdiction and of the macedonians who live in bulgaria the articles also insist that ‘ the process of assimilation in pirin must be stopped obviously the aim is to distort the historical truth to ignore the bulgarian character of certain geographical regions and to provoke overt opposition by one part of the population to another this also threatens the territorial integrity of the country whereas article of the constitution prohibits organisations from engaging in such activities even if despite what was found above it is assumed that the activities of ilinden do not run counter to the constitution its article provides that associations may not pursue political goals and carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties the political character of the aims of ilinden is clearly shown by its articles of association while the applicable law provides that organisations seeking to engage in political tradeunion or religious activities must be regulated in a separate statute all this leads to the conclusion that what is sought is the registration of an association whose aims are illegal it can not be accepted that what is at issue is an organisation seeking to preserve the historical traditions and the cultural riches of a specific community the realisation of the true aims of ilinden would no doubt be at the expense of the unity of the bulgarian nation and the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country which is declared inviolable by article of the constitution. ilinden appealed to the sofia court of appeal arguing inter alia that it was not threatening the country s sovereignty and territorial integrity nor trying to distort the historical truth the refusal to register it was in breach of article of the constitution see paragraph below as it was based on the fact that it expressed views which differed from the officially sanctioned ones it was not proposing to engage in activities characteristic solely of a political party either on july the sofia court of appeal upheld the lower court s judgment it held in so far as relevant the received an application by the managing council of the newly formed non-profit association ilinden requesting it to be registered in the special register kept by the court in the impugned judgment the blagoevgrad regional court refused to register the association holding that ilinden s goals and the means for attaining them have a political character and run counter to the spirit of the nonprofit legal persons act and the provisions of the constitution this court shares those conclusions the evidence submitted alongside the application for registration namely the articles of the nonprofit association ilinden the minutes of its founding meeting held on october a list of the founders thirteen sample signatures of the members of the managing council notarised and expressly stating that these persons wish to take part in the association s management and representation and their criminal records shows that a founding meeting was held on october it was attended by individuals who unanimously resolved to form a nonprofit association named ilinden adopted its articles and elected a managing council consisting of thirteen members however the wording of the articles clauses and which set out the association s goals and the means for attaining them reveal their political character which is impermissible for a nonprofit association this follows from the interpretation of paragraph of the nonprofit legal persons act which provides that organisations intending to carry out political tradeunion or religious activities must be regulated by separate statutes for instance in clause and of its articles the organisation proclaims itself as being a successor of and continuing the ‘ national liberation struggle of the macedonian nation including ‘ the macedonian fighters who fell victim to bulgarian state terrorism and genocide declares that ‘ it will express and defend the civil social and economic rights of the macedonians who live on macedonian soil under bulgarian occupation jurisdiction and of the macedonians living in bulgaria insists that ‘ the assimilation process in pirin macedonia must stop etc all those goals set by the newly formed organisation are directed towards distorting the historical truth and ignoring the bulgarian character of certain geographical regions with a view to stirring overt confrontation between one group of bulgarian citizens and another which imperils both the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation this is in breach of the imperative rule of article of the constitution which provides that ‘ organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty or the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation towards the incitement of racial national ethnical or religious enmity are prohibited moreover the political goals and the ways of attaining them set by the organisation in clause and of its articles are in breach of paragraph of the nonprofit legal persons act and article of the constitution apart from that the founders have elected thirteen members of the managing council in breach of the articles which provide in clause that the first managing council will consist of three members who will manage and represent the association clause this was equally in breach of section and in conjunction with section of the nonprofit legal persons act because it engenders uncertainty as to the manner of managing and representing the organisation in view of the foregoing this court finds that the newly formed organisation ilinden has goals ways of attaining them and representation which run counter to the provisions of the nonprofit legal persons act for this reason it should not be entered on the register of non-profit legal persons kept by the on november ilinden appealed on points of law it argued inter alia that contrary to the sofia court of appeal s ruling its articles when read properly showed that it did not intend to participate in political life nor was it trying to distort the historical truth its aim was to promote it the refusal to register it violated its right to freedom of association enshrined in article of the constitution and was in breach of article of the constitution see paragraph below ilinden also contested the sofia court of appeal s findings concerning its managing council in a final judgment of may реш № от май г. по гр д № г. вкс търговска колегия the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia court of appeal s judgment in the following terms the sofia court of appeal founded the refusal to register the association on the wording of the articles of association more specifically clauses and which show that the goals sought to be attained by the association and the means for their attainment are political in character the constitution guarantees freedom of association but only in line with the requirements of the law it is not permissible for a nonprofit association to carry out political tradeunion or religious activities the assertion in the appeal that ilinden does not seek to engage in political struggles is not substantiated as correctly observed by the sofia court of appeal an organisation which proclaims itself as being a successor and continuing the ‘ national liberation struggle of the macedonian nation and its founders as spiritual successors of ‘ the macedonian fighters who fell victim to bulgarian state terrorism and genocide has a markedly political character the lower court correctly held that an activity consisting in ‘ safeguarding the social and economic rights of the macedonians who live on macedonian soil under bulgarian occupation and of the macedonians living in bulgaria is in breach of article of the constitution which prohibits organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty or the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation or towards the incitement of racial national ethnical or religious enmity but even if the court were to accept the argument in the appeal that the organisation does not seek to attain goals which run counter to the constitutional order those goals run counter to the nonprofit legal persons act as they are characteristic of a political party not of a nonprofit association thus the alleged violation of article of the constitution has not been made out the argument in the appeal that the articles of association in reality merely mention the minimum number of members of the managing council without further restrictions is unfounded clause of the articles enclosed in the case file says that the managing council consists of three to seven members clause makes special provision for the first managing council and says that it will consist of three members serving three years that is clause does not merely set a minimum as claimed in the appeal for this reason the sofia court of appeal correctly found that the imperative rule of section and in conjunction with section of the nonprofit legal persons act has not been complied with the manner of managing and representing the organisation is unclear for the foregoing reasons the court is of the opinion that the grounds of appeal have not been made out and that the impugned judgment should be upheld. the relevant provisions of the constitution read article the territorial integrity of the shall be inviolable. article associations may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties. article no one may be persecuted or restricted in his rights because of his views nor detained or forced to provide information about his or another s convictions. article citizens may freely associate organisations whose activities are directed against the sovereignty or the territorial integrity of the country and the unity of the nation towards the incitement of racial national ethnical or religious enmity and organisations which seek to achieve their goals through violence are prohibited the law shall specify the organisations which are subject to registration the manner of their dissolution and their relations with the state. under paragraph of the transitional and concluding provisions of the non-profit legal persons act закон за

the case originated in an application no against the republic of hungary lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a hungarian national mr györgy budaházy the applicant on july the applicant was represented by mr t. gaudi-nagy a lawyer practising in budapest the hungarian government the government were represented by mr z. tallódi agent ministry of public administration and justice the applicant alleged in particular that his conviction in on account of having organised an unauthorised demonstration amounted to an interference with his rights under articles and of the convention on february the application was communicated to the government the applicant was born in and lives in diósd on july the applicant organised a demonstration aimed at forcing the authorities to preserve the ballot papers of the legislative elections with a view to a potential recounting the government submitted that the ballot papers were bound for statutory destruction on july as per section of decree no xii bm on the procedural time-limits for the legislative elections of april in the applicant s view the relevant law could be understood and was by many to the effect that the ballot papers could be destroyed as early as july previously on july parliament had decided not to put on the agenda a bill for the amendment of the statutory preservation period of the ballots the event organised by the applicant which had not been announced to the police consisted of completely blocking all six lanes of a centrally situated bridge over the danube erzsébet bridge by parking six cars across it with their doors locked the demonstration started at about a.m the demonstrators including the applicant refused to comply with the police s order to remove the vehicles and leave apart from ambulances no vehicles could pass the blockade by a.m. a crowd had gathered and the situation evolved into a massive traffic jam all over budapest at about a.m. the cars were finally towed away by the police and the traffic flow resumed at about noon on july the pest central district court imposed a regulatory fine of hungarian forints huf on the applicant the court held that the applicant by not complying with the police s instruction to leave the site of the demonstration had committed the regulatory offence of disorderly conduct within the meaning of section of act no lxix on regulatory offences international observers in particular the office for democratic institutions and human rights of the organization for security and co-operation in europe osce found that the parliamentary elections had been conducted in a manner consistent with international standards and that the hungarian electoral system had provided the basis for a generally transparent accountable free fair and equal process the hungarian media widely covered the events of july and in an official communiqué the president of the republic condemned the incident declaring it illegal he underlined that hungary was a stable parliamentary democracy where human rights were observed and where even critical views should be voiced in a lawful manner on september the budapest xi district police department fined the applicant for a parking offence which consisted of his parking his car in the middle of erzsébet bridge on july necessitating its being towed away on appeal on may the buda central district court reduced the fine to huf criminal proceedings were subsequently instituted against the applicant and his accomplices on june he was convicted of disturbance of public works within the meaning of section of the criminal code the pest central district court dismissed the defendants arguments according to which they had been exercising their freedom of assembly making reference to the court s judgment in the case of bukta and others v. hungary no echr the court made a distinction holding that the applicant s action could not be regarded as a spontaneous and prompt response to an event the court was satisfied that the statutory date for ballot paper destruction was july as per decree no see above paragraph nor was it lawful like in bukta since it had contravened the highway code and disturbed the functioning of public works in the latter regard the court observed that the demonstration had caused the traffic to become paralysed all over the capital for several hours and disturbed the running of bus lines in respect of scheduled individual bus trips concerning approximately passengers the applicant was sentenced to days of community work on november the budapest regional court upheld this judgment in response to the arguments of the accused on appeal the court noted that the message of the judgment is not that non-notified assemblies can not be peaceful the message is that an assembly notified or non-notified is not peaceful where by its very manner it constitutes unlawful conduct. the court referred to section of act no iii of on the right of assembly according to which the exercise of the right of assembly may not constitute an offence or instigation thereto or violate the rights and freedoms of others quoting the court s judgment in the case of ezelin v. france april series a no the regional court established that in peaceful assemblies the protection provided under article shall be ensured for the participants as long as they do not commit any reprehensible act on such an occasion in sum the court held that it directly follows from the case law of the constitutional court and the european court of human rights that the peaceful or non-peaceful nature of an assembly does not depend on whether a participant broke or smashed an asset or applied violence against a property an assembly may be rendered non-peaceful by passive conduct as well in its outward appearance the accused parties conduct seemed to be peaceful it is the causal result of their conduct the major disturbance of road traffic which rendered their conduct non-peaceful and thereby not protected under the law. on december the supreme court dismissed the defendants petition for review it added to the reasoning of the lower courts that criminal law rules can not be excluded or restricted by invoking the right of assembly the exercise of the right of assembly shall not be exempt from compliance with criminal law restrictions. this decision was served on the applicant on january section of the criminal code as in force at the relevant time provided any person who interferes with the functioning of public works to a considerable extent by damaging their equipment cables or interfering with them in any other way is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment of up to five years for the purposes of this section ‘ public works shall mean public utilities public transportation operations telecommunications networks as well as

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on july within the three-month period laid down by article and article of the convention it originated in an application no against the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland lodged with the commission under article by mr mobin ahmed mr dennis perrin mr ray bentley and mr david john brough all british citizens on september the commission s request referred to articles and and to the declaration whereby the united kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article the object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and of the convention and article of protocol no in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule d of rules of court a the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would

to take part in the further consideration of the case rule as president of the chamber rule mr bernhardt acting through the registrar consulted the agent of the united kingdom government the government the applicants lawyer and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the proceedings rules and pursuant to the orders made in consequence the registrar received the applicants memorial on december and the government s memorial on january a schedule to the applicants memorial setting out details of their claims under article of the convention was received at the registry on

submitted in accordance with the president s decision the hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on april the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr bratza mr goudie and mr morris mr mobin ahmed mr dennis perrin mr ray bentley and mr david brough are all british citizens born in and respectively they live in london yelverton edgware and exeter respectively at the relevant time they were each permanently employed in different capacities by various local authorities their precise status and functions are described in section c below the background to their complaints to the convention institutions is constituted by the enactment and implementation of legislative measures designed to limit the involvement of certain categories of local government officials such as themselves in political activities the history of the enactment of the relevant measures as well as their purport and scope are described in section b below the impact of the measures on the applicants all persons considered holders of politically restricted posts within the meaning of the applicable legislation is described in section c below against the background of the increasing politicisation of local government and attendant problems in respect of the relationship between elected members and local government officers the secretaries of state for the environment for scotland and for wales appointed on february a committee the widdicombe committee to inquire inter alia into the respective roles of elected members and officers of local government authorities and to make any necessary recommendations for strengthening the democratic process on may after receiving evidence from local government authorities and over other organisations and individuals the widdicombe committee submitted its report the committee firmly endorsed the continuation of the tradition of politically impartial local government officers having regard in particular to the roles of senior officers as managers advisers and arbitrators in the day-to-day functioning of local government in his foreword to the final report the chairman of the committee wrote although most of the problems we have perceived have been ones of uncertain relations there have been some cases albeit a few where power has been abused. in the chairman s view the recent sharpening of the political intensity of local politics was reflected in the relations between elected council members and local government officers and that the trend towards greater politicisation might be a source of future problems unless recommendations were made in order to provide a framework able to cope with it with regard to the importance of the impartiality of local government officers the widdicombe committee concluded that the overwhelming view in the evidence we have received has been that officers subject to very limited and closely defined exceptions should continue to serve the council as a whole … there has been equally wide agreement that the public service tradition of a permanent corps of politically impartial officers should be retained … public service in the united kingdom is founded on a tradition of a permanent corps of politically neutral officers serving with equal commitment whatever party may be in political control … local government in the united kingdom has traditionally been based on the same public service tradition as central government but this has been a matter of convention and practice … the issue of principle is therefore straightforward there must continue to be a system of permanent and politically neutral officers appointed on the basis of merit the issue which we need to consider is whether new machinery or rules are required to ensure this and if so on what basis. to ensure that senior officers continued to discharge their functions in a manner which was impartial from both a subjective and an objective point of view the widdicombe committee in paragraph of its report recommended that a the legislation should be amended so that persons who are councillors or who are standing for election as councillors or who have been councillors within the last year may not be employed by another authority at the rank of principal officer or above b the local authorities conditions of service advisory board should take steps to include in the terms and conditions of officers at the rank of principal officer and above a prohibition on political activity including i standing for and holding public elected office ii holding office in a political party iii speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate and iv canvassing at elections c if the changes recommended at b are not made to officers terms and conditions legislation should be introduced to similar effect. following the publication of the recommendations of the widdicombe committee on november the house of commons passed the local government and housing act the act which empowered the secretary of state for the environment to make regulations to restrict the political activities of certain categories of local government officers the act entered into force on november the local government officers political restrictions regulations the regulations were made under section of the act on april they were laid before parliament the following day and came into force on may the regulations applied to all persons holding a politically restricted post as defined in section of the act this term covers three broad categories of local government officials the most senior post-holders in local government category one officials remunerated in excess of a prescribed level and whose posts are listed for the purposes of the application of the regulations category two and officials paid less than the prescribed level but who hold a listed post category three each local authority was obliged to draw up a list of posts falling within the second and third categories section a local government officer in the second and third categories could apply to an independent adjudicator to have his or her post removed from the list of posts to which the regulations applied section all local government officials employed in these categories at the time of the entry into force of the regulations were deemed according to regulation to be subject to the measures a more detailed analysis of the contents of the act and the regulations is set out at paragraphs below the first applicant mr ahmed was a solicitor employed by the london borough of hackney although his salary fell below the level prescribed in section a of the act see paragraphs above and especially below making him a category three officer the council pursuant to section c of the act included his post in the list of politically restricted posts because in its opinion his post involved giving advice on a regular basis to committees of the council namely the housing benefits review board the housing development sub-committee and the environmental sub-committee see paragraph below mr ahmed was adopted as labour candidate for election to the london borough of enfield in but was obliged to withdraw his candidature as a result of the regulations on march he applied for removal of his job description from the list of politically restricted posts prior to his retirement the second applicant mr perrin was principal valuer with the devon county council a category three officer he was responsible for leading directing and developing the council s area valuation staff his post required him to give regular advice to the council s committees including strategy advice on key estate management issues and to speak to the media accordingly his post was included in the list of politically restricted posts kept by the council in accordance with section of the act see paragraph above and especially paragraph below on february mr perrin applied for exemption from political restrictions on the ground that although he advised the council at meetings and spoke to the media the advice was factual valuation information regarding the acquisition disposal and management of property his application for exemption was refused on march the adjudicator wrote i am satisfied that the duties of your post do fall within section of the act in that you do regularly attend committee meetings of the authority to give advice your authority do state that this advice does not extend to ‘ policy advice but the act itself makes no distinction between types of advice i am not prepared therefore to grant an exemption under section of the act. as a result of the regulations mr perrin had to give up his position as vice-chair and property officer of the exeter constituency labour party and had to refrain from supporting and assisting labour candidates in exeter city council elections including his wife who was a candidate in may and may he also reduced his involvement in trade union activities the third applicant mr bentley is a planning manager with plymouth city council he resigned from his position as chairman of torridge and west devon constituency labour party because of the regulations and was also restricted in canvassing for his wife who stood as the only labour councillor for the west devon borough council and in giving radio interviews in his capacity as chairman of the plymouth health emergency a body concerned with national health policies the monitoring officer of the council classified mr bentley s post as one that was politically sensitive a category one post and appropriately subject to political restrictions under section of the act see paragraph below the reasons for the classification included that mr bentley was head of the council s corporate policy unit that he was responsible directly to the head of the council s paid service that his post was responsible for policy analysis and research that he represented the council on a transport steering group involving other authorities and organisations and that in the twelve months prior to august he attended three meetings of the council s policy and resources finance sub- committee and advised on four separate issues of public transport the monitoring officer considered that mr bentley s post also fell within section a and b of the act and was therefore politically restricted in any event see paragraph below mr bentley applied for exemption from political restrictions on november the adjudicator underlined that he regarded his duties as limited to considering applications concerning restrictions under section of the act he stated that although the council may have identified the post as being politically restricted it was not politically restricted because of that fact but because it is explicitly covered by section c of the act i therefore do not consider it necessary or desirable to address the question of whether this post meets the criteria for inclusion in the list of posts under section or for exemption from that list unless or until it is established that the post is not covered by section c the fourth applicant mr brough is employed by the hillingdon borough council as the head of its committee services department a category one post the provision of services to the council s committees necessarily involves the committee services department in frequent contact as a consequence of the regulations mr brough can no longer act as parliamentary chairman of his party in harrow east and is prevented from speaking at public meetings on issues such as housing and the health service mr brough did not apply for exemption from the scope of the regulations the applicants and nalgo the predecessor of unison the trade union of which the applicants are members and which represents public-sector workers applied for and were granted leave to apply for judicial review of the regulations the application was dismissed on december the judge mr justice hutchison considered that he was bound by the recent decision of the house of lords in the case of r. v. secretary of state for the home department ex parte brind and others regarding the status of article of the convention in domestic law in connection with the test of wednesbury unreasonableness the judge referred to an affidavit submitted by mr simcock a senior civil servant at the department of the environment in which mr simcock explained how the widdicombe committee see paragraph above had been set up in to inquire into local authority practices and procedures with particular reference to the respective roles of elected members and officers mr simcock also described the consultation process between the publication of the widdicombe report and the making of the regulations in which nalgo was involved and how the regulations were in some respects less restrictive than the widdicombe committee s proposals referring to senior officers the widdicombe committee had said it is part of their job to advise councillors and to adjudicate on matters of propriety and in so doing they must command the respect and trust of all political parties there might well be some senior officers who are politically active but who are nevertheless totally able to detach themselves from such activity in carrying out their duties as neutral officers nevertheless we believe there will always be a very significant risk that they are viewed with suspicion by councillors of other parties and that as a consequence the performance of their duties towards the council as a whole will be impaired. the judge continued i preface my summary by pointing out that some of the applicants complaints reflect the applicants root and branch opposition to the whole concept of restricting the political activities of local government employees it is said that some of these points will have to be considered individually when i come to deal with further arguments advanced by the applicants under quite different heads but in the context of wednesbury unreasonableness i propose only to say that they do not in my judgment come near to establishing a case of perversity i have already briefly referred to the genesis of the act and the regulations in the widdicombe report and to the consultative processes that followed it paragraph of the report contained the recommendation that ‘ terms and conditions of persons holding politically restricted posts should include a prohibition on political activity including iii speaking or writing in public in a personal capacity in a way that might be regarded as engaging in party political debate the government s command paper in july in which as already mentioned the view was expressed that the categories of persons holding politically restricted posts should be more restricted than the report proposed spelt out the essential aim that ‘ it was important that the post-holder should be seen to be politically impartial but that otherwise local government employees should not be subject to restrictions on their political activity. of the specific arguments mentioned in a to h above those in a b e g and h are it seems to me essentially arguments against the whole concept of restricting such activities and in the circumstances can not found an attack on wednesbury grounds the arguments summarised in c and d are to the effect that the regulations are uncertain and incapable of consistent and fair application as a wednesbury argument this contention could not avail the applicants at least unless the regulations were void for uncertainty this would be a distinct ground for challenge which plainly they are not finally the argument mentioned in f is in my view misconceived the regulations do not prohibit the kind of activities there mentioned i shall have more to say on this subject when i deal with the applicants specific arguments on vires and legitimate expectation to the first of which i now turn. in conclusion the judge found that the regulations did not go beyond the policy and purpose of the act and rejected an argument that the applicants had a legitimate expectation that the government would not interfere with trade union activities on the basis of an assurance from the then minister for local government matters an appeal to the court of appeal was dismissed on november lord justice neill found that the provisions of article of the convention did not assist nalgo and the applicants confirmed that it was not open to the courts below the house of lords to depart from the traditional wednesbury grounds in reviewing the decision of a minister who has exercised a discretion vested in him by parliament and found that the regulations were not wednesbury unreasonable or ultra vires he also agreed with the first-instance judge as to legitimate expectation the other judges lords justices russell and rose agreed leave to appeal to the house of lords was refused the house of lords refused leave to appeal to it on march section of the act provides the terms of appointment or conditions of employment of every person holding a politically restricted post under a local authority including persons appointed to such posts before the coming into force of this section shall be deemed to incorporate such requirements for restricting his political activities as may be prescribed for the purposes of this subsection by regulations made by the secretary of state. the term persons holding a politically restricted post is defined by section of the act it consists of three broad categories of local government officer excluding headmasters and teachers who are exempt from the operation of the regulations by reason of section of the act the first category consists of officers who hold certain posts specified in section a to f of the act namely the head of the authority s paid service section a the chief officers section b and c the deputy chief officers section d the monitoring officer section e and assistants for political groups section f there are an estimated officers in this category according to the government s memorial the chief officers are the heads of the various departments within the local authority s administration they consist of statutory and non-statutory chief officers these terms are defined in section and of the act respectively the statutory chief officers are the chief education officer the chief officer of the fire brigade the director of social services or director of social work and the chief financial officer a non-statutory chief officer is defined as inter alia a person for whom the head of the authority s paid service is responsible section a or a person who largely or exclusively reports directly to or is directly accountable to the head of the authority s paid service section b a deputy chief officer is a person who as regards all or most of the duties of his or her post is required to report directly or is directly accountable to one or more of the statutory or non-statutory chief officers section by section purely secretarial or clerical staff are not non-statutory chief officers or deputy chief officers the second category consists of those local government officers whose annual rate of remuneration exceeds the level specified in section a and b of the act the prescribed level which is currently pounds sterling per annum or pro rata for part-time posts and whose posts have not been exempted from the operation of the regulations the government estimate that there are approximately officers whose salary exceeded the prescribed level however in their view the number of officers who were actually subject to the regulations is considerably less than since a significant number had either been granted an exemption or would have been entitled to one had they applied the third category defined by section c of the act consists of those local government officers whose annual rate of remuneration is less than the prescribed level but whose duties consist in or involve one or both of the duties identified in section namely according to the government s memorial there are an estimated officers in this category each authority is obliged to prepare a list of persons falling within the second and third categories section any officer whose post is included on this list is entitled to be removed from the list on the grounds that his or her duties do not include duties of the kind set out in section section of the act provides for the appointment of a person to consider applications for exemption from political restriction if the person appointed who is called the adjudicator finds that the duties of a listed post that is those posts falling within the second and third categories do not fall within section he or she is required to direct that the post is not to be regarded as a politically restricted post the authority must then remove the post from the list maintained under section according to the government as at january applications had been made for exemption of which have been granted the schedule part i to the regulations prohibits the participation of persons holding politically restricted posts including persons appointed to such posts before the coming into force of the regulations in elections for the house of commons the european parliament or any local authority either as a candidate paragraph an election agent paragraph or a canvasser paragraph it does not prohibit membership of a political party but does prohibit the holding of an office within a political party if that would involve participating in the general management of that party or one of its branches paragraph a or representing the party in dealing with others paragraph b speaking to the public or to a section of the public or publishing any written or artistic work with the apparent intention of affecting public support for a political party is also prohibited by paragraphs and of part ii of the schedule under paragraph nothing in paragraphs and shall be construed as precluding the appointee to a politically restricted post from engaging in the activities mentioned in those two paragraphs to such an extent as is necessary for the proper performance of his duties in accordance with regulation when determining whether a person has breached the terms and conditions set out in paragraphs and regard shall be had to a whether the appointee referred to a political party or to persons identified with a political party or whether anything said by him or the relevant work promotes or opposes a point of view identifiable as the view of one political party and not of another and b where the appointee spoke or the work was published as part of a campaign the effect which the campaign appears to be designed to achieve. the government informed the court in their memorial that a review was then being conducted of the detail of the legislation governing political restrictions on local government officers the aim of the review was to ensure that the detail of the restrictions imposed was essential for the maintenance of political impartiality of senior local government officials at the hearing the government informed the court that the review had mr ahmed mr perrin mr bentley mr brough and unison a trade union representing public-sector workers applied to the commission on september they alleged that the local government officers political restrictions regulations operate to their detriment in a way which denies their rights to freedom of expression article of the convention and of assembly article and their rights to participate fully in the electoral process article of protocol the commission declared the application no admissible on september with the exception of the complaint brought by unison in its report of may article it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of article of the convention thirteen votes to four that it was not necessary to consider whether there had been a violation of article of the convention thirteen votes to four and that there had been no violation of article of protocol unanimously the full text of the commission s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment the applicants in their memorial and at the hearing requested the court to find that the facts of the case disclose a breach of their rights under articles and of the convention and article of protocol no and to award them just satisfaction under article of the convention the government in reply requested the court in their memorial and at the hearing to decide and declare that the facts

the case originated in an application no against the republic of poland lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by three polish nationals mr jerzy gorzelik mr rudolf kołodziejczyk and mr erwin sowa the applicants on june the applicants who had been granted legal aid were represented by mr s. waliduda a lawyer practising in the polish government the government were represented by their agent mr k. drzewicki of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicants alleged a breach of article of the convention in that they had been refused permission to register an association called union of people of silesian nationality the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no it was allocated to the fourth section of the court by a decision of may following a hearing on admissibility and the merits rule of the rules of court the application was declared admissible by a chamber of that section composed of mr g. ress president mr a. pastor ridruejo mr l. caflisch mr j. makarczyk mr v. butkevych mr j. hedigan and mrs s. botoucharova judges and mr v. berger section registrar on december the chamber gave judgment holding unanimously that there had been no violation of article of the convention on march the applicants requested under article of the convention and rule that the case be referred to the grand chamber on july a panel of the grand chamber decided to accept the request the composition of the grand chamber was determined in accordance with the provisions of article and of the convention and rule on july mr makarczyk the judge who had sat in respect of in the original chamber article of the convention and rule d resigned from the court subsequently on june he withdrew from the case article of the convention and rules and he was replaced by mr l. garlicki his successor as the judge elected in respect of the applicants and the government each filed a memorial a hearing took place in public in the on july rule there appeared before the court one of the applicants mr gorzelik was also present the court heard addresses by mr waliduda mr drzewicki and ms kowalska mr gorzelik also made a short statement in reply to a question put by the court the applicants were born in and respectively all three live in mr gorzelik and mr sowa in and mr kołodziejczyk in śląsk is a historic region that is now in south-western it was originally a polish province that became a possession of the bohemian crown in it passed with that crown to the house of habsburg in and was taken over by in under the treaty of berlin after the first world war the treaty of versailles provided for a plebiscite to be held to determine if upper silesia should remain german or pass over to the results of the plebiscite in were favourable to except in the easternmost part of upper silesia after an armed uprising of the poles in the league of nations agreed to a partition of the territory the larger part of the industrial area including passed over to in the aftermath of the munich pact of most of czech silesia was divided between and after the german conquest of in the whole of polish silesia was annexed by after the second world war the boundary between and was restored the western boundary of was moved to the oder and lusatian neisse rivers in effect all of former german silesia east of the lusatian neisse was incorporated into while only a small sector of lower silesia west of the neisse remained within the former east german land of saxony according to some linguists although the polish language is relatively unaffected by regional variations it is possible to identify at least two regional varieties kashubian and silesian at the hearing one of the applicants mr gorzelik described silesian as a still uncodified language that was a mixture of czech german and polish from may to june a census the national population and housing census was carried out in its purpose was to gather data relating to the distribution of the population demographic and social factors employment standards of living and housing it also addressed issues relating to citizenship and nationality one of the questions relating to nationality gave the following definition nationality is a declared based on a subjective feeling individual feature of every human being expressing his or her emotional cultural or genealogical relating to parents origin link with a specific nation. according to the census report prepared by the central statistical office główny urząd statystyczny people of the population declared themselves polish nationals persons of the population declared a non-polish nationality including persons who declared that they were silesians on an unspecified date the applicants who describe themselves as silesians decided together with other persons to form an association stowarzyszenie called union of people of silesian nationality związek ludności narodowości śląskiej the founders subsequently adopted a memorandum of association the applicants were elected to the provisional management committee komitet założycielski and were authorised to proceed with the registration of the association on december the applicants acting on behalf of the provisional management committee of the union of people of silesian nationality applied to the sąd wojewódzki for their association to be registered they relied on inter alia section of the law on associations prawo o stowarzyszeniach of april they produced the memorandum of association along with the other documents required by that law the relevant general provisions of the memorandum of association read as follows the present association shall be called the union of people of silesian nationality hereafter referred to as the union the union shall conduct its activity within the territory of the it may establish local branches the union may join other domestic or international organisations if the aims pursued by the latter correspond to the aims pursued by the union. the aims of the association and the means of achieving them were described as follows the aims of the union are to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians to restore silesian culture to promote knowledge of to protect the ethnic rights of persons of silesian nationality and to provide social care for members of the union the union shall accomplish its aims by the following means organising lectures seminars training courses and meetings establishing libraries and clubs and carrying out scientific research organising cultural and educational activities for members of the union and other persons carrying out promotional and publishing activities promoting the emblems and colours of and upper silesia organising demonstrations or other protest actions organising sporting events and other forms of leisure activities setting up schools and other educational establishments cooperating with other organisations conducting business activities for the purpose of financing the aims of the union this may include establishing commercial entities and cooperating with other commercial entities establishing other entities or legal persons with a view to achieving the aims of the union and conducting any other activities. paragraphs and dealt with membership they read as follows there shall be two categories of members of the union namely ordinary members and supporting members any person of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the union. the relevant part of paragraph of the memorandum of association read as follows a person shall cease to be a member of the union if a on a reasoned motion by the board the management committee decides to deprive him of his membership b the relevant motion of the board may be based on such reasons as the fact that the member in question has not fulfilled the requirements set out in the memorandum of association for becoming a member or has failed to perform the duties of members as specified in paragraph paragraph provided the union is an organisation of the silesian national minority. subsequently the pursuant to section of the law on associations see paragraph below served a copy of the applicants application together with copies of the relevant enclosures on the governor wojewoda of katowice on january the governor of katowice acting through the department of civic affairs wydział obywatelski submitted his comments on the application to the court those comments contained lengthy arguments against allowing the association to be registered the main thrust of which was as follows i it can not be said that there are 'silesians ślązak in the sense of representatives of a distinct 'silesian nationality 'silesian is a word denoting a representative of a local ethnic group not a nation this is confirmed by paragraph of the memorandum of association which aims merely to 'awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians ii the social research relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the existence of a 'silesian nationality does not accord with numerous other scientific publications polish sociology distinguishes between two concepts of 'homeland namely a 'local homeland and an 'ideological homeland in german this distinction is expressed by the terms heimat local homeland and vaterland ideological homeland the research relied on by the applicants merely refers to the self-identification of the inhabitants of indicating that their local self-identification takes precedence over their national self-identification iii paragraph of the memorandum of association states that any person of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the association but does not clearly specify the criteria for establishing whether or not a given person fulfils this requirement this absence of unambiguous criteria is contrary to section i and iv of the law on associations moreover it renders paragraph b of the memorandum unlawful for that provision allows the management committee to deprive a person of his membership in the event of failure to satisfy the conditions set out in the memorandum of association iv paragraph of the memorandum of association which calls the union an 'organisation of the silesian national minority is misleading and does not correspond to the facts there is no basis for regarding the silesians as a national minority recognising them as such would be in breach of articles and of the former constitution which guarantee polish citizens equal rights in particular under the relevant provisions of the law on elections to the sejm of may ordynacja wyborcza do sejmu rzeczypospolitej polskiej 'the elections act registration of the union would give it a privileged position in terms of distribution of seats in parliament the union would obtain rights and privileges guaranteed to national minorities in respect of education in their native language and access to the media registration of the association would be to the detriment of other ethnic groups in such as cracovians krakowiacy highlanders górale and mazurians mazurzy this would amount to a return to the tribalism podziały plemienne which existed prior to the formation of the v we therefore propose that the memorandum of association should be amended so as to reflect the above observations in particular the misleading name of the association should be changed the criteria for membership should be set out in an unambiguous manner and paragraph should be deleted in our opinion these are the conditions for registration of the association. on march the applicants filed a pleading in reply to those arguments they asserted that the fact that the majority of poles failed to recognise the existence of a silesian nation did not mean that there was no such nation they cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the silesians formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at the end of the first world war moreover the silesians had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group regardless of whether upper silesia had belonged to germany or to poland consequently any comparison between them and the cracovians or highlanders was totally unjustified because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as national minorities nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past finally the applicants cited certain letters of the ministry of the interior that had been published by the press and which explained that the national and ethnic minorities bill had explicitly stated that a declaration that a person belongs to a minority shall not be questioned or verified by the public authorities on april the governor of katowice filed a pleading with the court he maintained his previous position on april he produced two letters from the ministry of the interior dated february and april respectively and addressed to the department of civic affairs of the office of the governor of katowice the relevant parts of the letter of february read we share your doubts as to whether certain inhabitants of should be deemed to be a national minority we therefore suggest that you submit your observations to the court indicating those doubts and that you ask the court to grant you leave to join the proceedings as a party we suggest that you rely on the fact that the council of europe framework convention for the protection of national minorities 'the framework convention has not been ratified by poland so that its provisions do not apply in the domestic legal system in our view neither historical nor ethnographical circumstances justify the opinion that the inhabitants of can be recognised as a national minority. the relevant parts of the letter of april read as follows the arguments advanced by the provisional management committee of the association in their pleading of march do not contain any new elements in particular the framework convention does not constitute the law applicable in likewise the letters of the ministry of the interior on the interpretation of the national and ethnic minorities bill do not change the situation the sense of belonging to a nation falls within the realm of personal liberties it does not in itself entail any legal consequences by contrast the formation of an organisation of a national minority is a legal fact which entails legal consequences such as for instance those referred to in the elections act in the circumstances the registration of the association called 'union of people of silesian nationality could be allowed provided that the existence of such a nation had been established. on april the applicants submitted a further pleading to the court they criticised the arguments of the ministry of the interior pointing out that the latter had failed to indicate any legal basis for rejecting their application in particular the authorities had not shown that any provision of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law whereas under section of the law on associations the exercise of the right of association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary for ensuring the interests of national security or public order and for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others lastly the applicants stated that they would not amend the memorandum of association in the manner proposed by the authorities in particular in respect of the name of the association and the content of paragraph they agreed however to amend paragraph of the memorandum and rephrased it as follows everyone who is a polish citizen and who has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the union on may the held an explanatory hearing posiedzenie wyjaśniające aimed at obtaining comments and clarifications from the parties and settling the matters in dispute the relevant parts of the minutes of that hearing read as follows the representatives of the governor declared that the deletion of paragraph from the memorandum of association would not be sufficient and that they also required a change in the name of the association they referred to the arguments set out in the pleadings filed in the case the representatives of the applicants declared that paragraph was modelled on a similar provision to be found in the statutes of the socio-cultural society of germans of the the president urged the representatives of the parties to make certain concessions in their positions he proposed to the provisional management committee that for example they delete paragraph of the memorandum however the representatives of the committee absolutely refused to do away with this provision the representatives of the governor also adopted a harder position in that they demanded not only the deletion of paragraph but also a change of the name of the association the two sides engaged in a polemic as to whether or not silesians should be recognised as a nation or nationality the representatives of the governor argued with the applicants claiming there were no grounds for ascribing silesian nationality to people the hearing was adjourned and subsequently resumed at this point the representative of the governor declared that if the applicants were to delete paragraph from the memorandum the governor would not object to registration of the association gorzelik reacted vehemently to this proposal but the president told him to think it over in connection with the above the applicants asked to be given a time-limit within which they could react in writing to this suggestion and consider the governor 's proposal the court decided to allow the applicants ten days in which to react to the proposal of the governor on may the applicants lodged a pleading with the court maintaining that in the course of the above-mentioned hearing the authorities had de facto acknowledged that a silesian nation exists in particular by accepting the name of the association and certain provisions of the memorandum namely paragraph and and paragraph they stressed however that the authorities insistence on the removal of paragraph was unjustified and illogical and consequently refused to alter or delete that provision later on june the governor of katowice submitted his final pleading to the court opposing the registration of the association on june the sitting with a single judge and in camera granted the applicants application and registered their association under the name union of people of silesian nationality the relevant reasons for that decision read as follows there was a dispute between the parties over the concepts 'nation and 'national minority finally the authorities concerned pleaded that the application for registration of the association should be rejected this court has found that the application is well-founded and as such should be granted in the preamble to the law on associations the legislature guarantees everyone a cardinal right the right to freedom of association which enables citizens regardless of their convictions to participate actively in public life and express different opinions and to pursue individual interests freedom of association is one of the natural rights of a human being for this reason section of the law on associations does not establish the right to freedom of association but merely sets out the manner and limits of its exercise thus reflecting poland 's international obligations under section of the law on associations the right to form an association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law either in the interests of national security or public safety or in the interests of public order or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others no other restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the right to associate with others as recently as june in their pleading the authorities advanced the argument that the registration of the present association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others because it would result in an unequal treatment of other local communities and would diminish their rights this argument is unconvincing since it does not emerge from the content of the memorandum of association that the future activities of the association are aimed at diminishing the rights and freedoms of others under paragraph of the memorandum of association the aims of the association are for example to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians to restore silesian culture to promote knowledge of and to provide social care for members of the association none whatsoever of these aims is directed against the rights and freedoms of others the means to be used for accomplishing these aims are not directed against the rights and freedoms of others either those means include organising lectures and seminars carrying out scientific research establishing libraries organising cultural and educational activities for members and other persons carrying out promotional and publishing activities promoting the emblems and colours of silesia and upper silesia organising demonstrations and protest actions organising sporting events setting up schools and other educational establishments conducting business activities and cooperating with other organisations in sum the argument that the association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others must definitely be rejected moreover it should be noted that this argument refers to a mere possibility because only practical action taken by the association could possibly demonstrate whether and if so to what extent the future activities of the association would require taking measures aimed at protecting the rights of others as regards the terms 'silesian nationality or 'silesian national minority the problems involved in the determination of their proper meaning can not be examined by this court in detail this court must pursuant to section of the law on associations rule on the present application within a period not exceeding three months from the date on which it was lodged it is therefore not possible in the course of the present proceedings to determine such complicated issues which involve problems falling within the sphere of international relations it is however possible to assume for the purposes of making a ruling in these proceedings that the nationality of an individual is a matter of personal choice moreover it is a matter of common knowledge that the original inhabitants of silesia constitute a minority in upper silesia at least for anyone who has ever spent some time in this region and has been willing to perceive this fact after all the authorities although they 'rend their garments sic complaining that the applicants dare establish an association do not contest the fact that the silesians are an ethnic minority in view of the foregoing this court finding that the provisional management committee has complied with the requirements of sections and read in conjunction with section of the law on associations and article of the code of civil procedure holds as in the operative part of the decision. on july the governor of katowice lodged an appeal with the katowice court of appeal sąd apelacyjny asking that the first-instance decision be quashed that the case be remitted to the court of first instance and that expert evidence be obtained in order to determine the meaning of the terms nation and national minority in his appeal he alleged that the court of first instance had violated sections and of the law on associations and unspecified provisions of the code of civil procedure the relevant grounds of the appeal read as follows the court of first instance formally recognised and legally sanctioned the existence of a distinct silesian nation constituting a 'silesian national minority in our opinion such an important and unprecedented ruling which is of international significance could not and should not be given without defining the concepts of 'nation and 'national minority the leaving this issue aside merely because of certain statutory time-limits simplified the proceedings in an unacceptable manner this led in itself to a failure on the part of the court to establish all the circumstances relevant to the outcome of the case and furthermore provided a sufficient basis for this appeal the appellant admits that polish law does not define the terms 'nation and 'national minority this however does not justify the conclusion of the that 'the nationality of an individual is a matter of personal choice the appellant does not contest the right of a person to decide freely to belong to a national minority however a precondition for making such a choice is the existence of a 'nation with which that person identifies himself the decision appealed against proclaims the opinion that the subjective feelings of the person concerned suffice for the purposes of creating a 'nation or a 'nationality having regard to the potential social repercussions of such an approach it is not possible to agree with it in these circumstances prior to making any decision on the registration of the 'union of people of silesian nationality it is necessary to determine whether a 'silesian nation exists a distinct non-polish nation and whether it is admissible in law to create a 'silesian national minority in the appellant 's opinion there are no objective arguments in favour of the finding that a distinct silesian nation exists in case of doubt this question should be resolved by obtaining evidence from experts in the contested decision the lower court focused in principle on determining whether the aims of the association and the means of accomplishing those aims were lawful the appellant does not contest the majority of these aims it must be said that such activities as restoring silesian culture promoting knowledge of silesia or providing social care for members of the association are worthy of respect and support however these aims can be fully accomplished without the contested provision of the memorandum of association namely paragraph in addition the applicants were not prevented from incorporating the above-mentioned aims into the memorandum of an existing association called 'movement for the autonomy of silesia ruch autonomii śląska the more so as the applicants belong to influential circles of the latter organisation the fact that the applicants have failed to do so but instead are creating a new association and are describing themselves as a 'silesian national minority clearly demonstrates what their real objective is in fact their objective is to circumvent the provisions of the elections act under which parties or other organisations standing in elections must reach a threshold of or of votes in order to obtain seats in parliament legal acts including the act of adopting a memorandum of association are null and void under article of the civil code if they aim at evading or circumventing the law according to legal theory defects in legal acts as defined in article of the civil code may constitute a basis for refusing to register an association sanctioning the rights of the 'silesian national minority amounts to discrimination against other regional and ethnic groups or societies this will be the case at least as regards electoral law and will be contrary to article of the constitution the katowice court of appeal heard the appeal on september the prosecutor at the court of appeal prokurator apelacyjny appeared at the hearing and asked the court to grant him leave to join the proceedings as a party intervening on behalf of the governor of katowice leave was granted the court next heard addresses by the appellant the prosecutor who requested the court to set aside the first-instance decision and reject the applicants application and the representative of the applicants on the same day the court set aside the first-instance decision and rejected the applicants application for their association to be registered the reasons for that decision included the following the lower court by registering the association under the name 'union of people of silesian nationality approved paragraph of the memorandum of association which states that the union is an organisation of the silesian national minority we therefore agree with the appellant that the union on the basis of the above-mentioned paragraph would have the right to benefit from the statutory privileges laid down in section of the elections act furthermore recognising the silesians as a national minority may also result in further claims on their part for privileges granted to national minorities by other statutes contrary to the opinion expressed by the lower court it is possible to determine whether or not the silesians constitute a national minority in it is not necessary to obtain expert evidence in that connection under article of the code of civil procedure facts that are common knowledge that is those which every sensible and experienced citizen should know do not need to be proved common knowledge includes historical economic political and social phenomena and events it is therefore clear that at present no legal definition of 'nation or 'national minority is commonly accepted in international relations on the other hand an 'ethnic group is understood as a group which has a distinct language a specific culture and a sense of social ties is aware of the fact that it differs from other groups and has its own name polish ethnographic science of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries describes 'silesians as an autochthonous population of polish origin residing in silesia a geographical and historical region at present as a result of political and social changes the term 'silesians refers equally to immigrants who have been living in this territory for several generations and who identify themselves with their new region of residence it also refers to the german-speaking population linked with by such factors as birth residence and tradition see the encyclopaedia published by the polish scientific publishers in the applicants derive the rights they claim from the principles set out in the framework convention stating that every person belonging to a national minority has the right freely to choose to belong or not to belong to such a minority in relying on european standards they fail however to remember that a national minority with which a given person identifies himself must exist there must be a society established on the basis of objective criteria with which this person wishes to identify no one can determine his national identity independently of a fundamental element which is the existence of a specific nation it emerges from the above-mentioned definition of a 'nation that a nation is formed in a historical process which may last for centuries and that the crucial element which forms a nation is its self-identification that is to say its national awareness established on the basis of the existing culture by a society residing on a specific territory certainly the silesians belong to a regional group with a very deep sense of identity including their cultural identity no one can deny that they are distinct this does not however suffice for them to be considered a distinct nation they have never commonly been perceived as a distinct nation and they have never tried to determine their identity in terms of the criteria for a 'nation on the contrary the history of unequivocally demonstrates that the autochthonous inhabitants of this region have preserved their distinct culture and language the latter having polish roots from an ethnic point of view even though their territories were not within the borders of the and even though they were under strong german influence they are therefore silesians in the sense of inhabitants of the region not in the sense of their nationality thus upper silesia in its ethnic roots sic remained polish that was without a doubt demonstrated by three uprisings the role played by the silesians in building and preserving the polish character of even though they remained isolated from their homeland is unquestionable however a given nation exists where a group of individuals considering itself a 'nation is in addition accepted and perceived as such by others in the common opinion of polish citizens both the silesians and other regional groups or communities for example the highlanders or the mazurians are perceived merely as local communities in the international sphere and similarly and are perceived as single-nation states regardless of the fact that there exist distinct ethnic groups for example the inhabitants of or in or the inhabitants of in on the whole sociologists agree that the silesians constitute an ethnic group and that the autochthonous inhabitants of do have some features of a nation but that those features are not fully developed that means that the awakening of their national identity is still at a very early stage a nation exists only when there are no doubts as to its right to exist in national minorities constitute only a small part of society that is to say about to they include and this has never been denied germans ukrainians belarusians lithuanians slovaks czechs jews roma armenians and tatars in the polish tradition national minorities are perceived as groups linked to a majority outside in other words a minority is an ethnic group that has support amongst a majority residing abroad moreover traditionally our society has not considered that groups which preserve a distinct culture but which do not belong to any state can be deemed to be national minorities accordingly for a long time the roma people were regarded as an ethnic not a national group the applicants opinion that the mere choice of the individual concerned is decisive for his nationality is reflected in paragraph of the memorandum of association acceptance of this opinion would consequently lead to a situation in which the aims pursued by the association could be accomplished by groups of members who did not have any connection or links with and who had become members of the union solely to gain an advantage for themselves undoubtedly such groups of members can not be allowed to accomplish the aims of an association of a national minority the applicants have relied on the results of sociological research carried out in in the indeed the research demonstrates that of persons requested to declare their ethnic and regional identity replied that they were silesians however it transpires from the material collected in the course of another piece of sociological research of which was submitted by the applicants during the appeal hearing that two years later the number of persons who considered themselves to be silesians had decreased to and that moreover the majority of inhabitants of the province of katowice considered themselves to be poles that is including who stated that they were 'polish silesians only of inhabitants considered themselves to be germans including who stated that they were 'german silesians in the light of the above research it can not be said that such a poorly established self-identity of a small and decreasing group of silesians as demonstrated by their refusal to declare that they belong to the polish nation provides a basis for recognising that all silesians who have lived in silesia for generations and state that they belong to the polish nation constitute a separate nation this would be contrary to the will of the majority a will well known to the applicants we therefore find that the appellant is right in submitting that granting the applicants application for their association to be registered is unjustified because the memorandum of association is contrary to the law namely article of the civil code indeed the application is aimed at registering an organisation of a minority which can not be regarded as a national minority and at circumventing the provisions of the elections act and other statutes conferring particular privileges on national minorities granting such a request could lead to granting unwarranted rights to the association in question this would moreover give it an advantage in relation to other regional or ethnic organisations in these circumstances in accordance with section of the law on associations and article of the civil code read in conjunction with articles and of the code of civil procedure and section of the law on associations the appeal must be allowed. on november the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law kasacja with the supreme court sąd najwyższy they alleged that the katowice court of appeal had wrongly interpreted the relevant provisions of the law on associations and that the impugned decision had contravened article of the constitution article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the convention their arguments are summarised as follows since a refusal to register an association could be justified only if an activity specified in the memorandum of association was banned by the law the principal issue to be determined by the court of appeal was whether the memorandum of the applicants association complied with the statutory requirements that was clearly not the case and the court 's fear that the registration of the applicants association would in future lead to discrimination against other national or ethnic minorities was based on mere speculation in any event the law on associations in sections et seq provided for various means whereby the activity of an association could be supervised by the competent state authorities or in the event that its activity was unlawful the association could be dissolved however the court of appeal instead of assessing the formal requirements of the registration decided at the outset that the core issue in the proceedings was to establish whether a silesian nation existed it consequently went on to lay down its own arbitrary and controversial definition of 'nation and 'national minority and finally concluded that there was no 'silesian nation it did so without any effort to obtain expert evidence in respect of such an important matter. on november the governor of katowice filed a pleading in reply to the applicants appeal on points of law the relevant arguments are summarised as follows the refusal to register the applicants association was fully justified in the course of the proceedings at first instance the governor eventually proposed that the applicants amend paragraph of the memorandum of association and alter the name of their association by deleting the word 'nationality those arguments were based on section i of the law on associations which provides that a memorandum of association should enable the association in question to be differentiated from other associations this means that the name of an association should not be misleading since the requirement set out in the above-mentioned section was not complied with the refusal to register the applicants association was justified under section it must be stressed that even in the explanatory report to the framework convention it is clearly stated that the individual 's subjective choice to belong to a national minority is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to the person 's identity that means that a given nation must exist prior to the individual making a decision to belong to this nation that being so the applicants application for their association to be registered must be seen as a thoughtless and incomprehensible attempt to exploit the distinct characteristics of the silesians with a view to achieving political aims. on november the prosecutor at the katowice court of appeal filed a pleading in reply to the applicants appeal on points of law he submitted among other things that it was clear that the content of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law since it explicitly stated that the union was an association of a national minority and thus ignored the fact that the silesians could not be regarded as a minority of that kind the silesians being merely an ethnic group could not exercise the rights conferred on national minorities in particular those referred to in the elections act on march the administrative labour and social security division of the supreme court sitting as a panel of three judges dismissed the applicants appeal on points of law the relevant parts of the reasons for this decision read as follows a necessary prerequisite for the registration of an association is the conformity of its memorandum of association with the entire domestic legal order including conformity with the provisions of international treaties ratified by in the present case the court of appeal had no doubts as to the lawfulness of the aims pursued by the applicants association but refused to register the association for the sole reason that the applicants in the memorandum of association used such terms as 'silesian nation and 'silesian national minority we agree with the opinion of the court of appeal 'national minority is a legal term see article of the constitution of february although it is not defined either in polish law or in the conventions relied on in the appeal on points of law however the explanatory report to the framework convention states plainly that the individual 's subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his or her national identity that means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question an individual has the right to choose his or her nation but this as the court of appeal rightly pointed out does not in itself lead to the establishment of a new distinct nation or national minority there was and still is a common perception that a silesian ethnic group does exist however this group has never been regarded as a national group and has not claimed to be regarded as such registration of the association which in paragraph of its memorandum of association states that it is an organisation of a specific national minority would be in breach of the law because it would result in a non-existent 'national minority taking advantage of privileges conferred on genuine national minorities this concerns in particular the privileges granted by the elections act such as an exemption from the requirement that a party or other organisation standing in elections should get at least of the votes which is a prerequisite for obtaining seats in parliament or privileges in respect of the registration of electoral lists thus it suffices for an organisation of a national minority to have its electoral lists registered in at least five constituencies whereas the general requirement is to register an electoral list in at least half of the constituencies in the whole of poland pursuant to the relevant ruling of the constitutional court trybunał konstytucyjny on the interpretation of the elections act the privileges referred to above are conferred on electoral committees of registered national minorities and in case of doubt as to whether or not an electoral committee represents a national minority the state electoral college may request evidence the simplest means of proving the existence of a specific national minority is to present a memorandum of association confirming that fact it is true that under the new constitution resolutions of the constitutional court on the interpretation of statutes no longer have universally binding force however in view of the persuasiveness of the reasons given by the constitutional court and the requirements of practice we consider that a memorandum of association still remains basic evidence demonstrating the existence of a national minority conferring on the silesians an ethnic group the rights of a national minority would be contrary to article of the constitution stating that all persons are equal before the law because other ethnic minorities would not enjoy the same rights the memorandum of association is contrary to section iv of the law on associations which stipulates that a memorandum of association must set out rules concerning acquisition and loss of membership and the rights and duties of members paragraph of the memorandum provides that everyone who is a polish citizen and has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of silesian nationality may become a member of the union whereas paragraph states that a person ceases to be a member of the union if inter alia he has not fulfilled the membership requirements set out in the memorandum of association since no silesian nation exists no one would lawfully be able to become a member of the union because his declaration of silesian nationality would be untrue furthermore it must be pointed out that the refusal to register the association does not contravene poland 's international obligations both the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention allow the state to place restrictions on the freedom of association in particular such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights of others it is contrary to public order to create a non-existent nation that would be able to benefit from the privileges conferred solely on national minorities such a situation would also lead to the infringement of the rights of others not only national minorities but also all other citizens of granting privileges to a specific group of citizens means that the situation of the other members of society becomes correspondingly less favourable this is particularly so in the sphere of election law if certain persons may become members of parliament because of their privileged position it means that other candidates must obtain a higher number of votes than what would be required in the absence of privileges in that respect it also has to be noted that the essential aims of the association can be accomplished without the contested provisions of the memorandum and without the specific name of the association under the provisions of the constitution of the republic of poland national and ethnic minorities have equal rights as regards their freedom to preserve and develop their own language to maintain their customs and traditions to develop their culture to establish educational institutions or institutions designed to protect their religious identity and to participate in the resolution of matters relating to their cultural identity see article article of the constitution which was

law of the shall be the constitution statutes ratified international treaties and ordinances. article states as soon as a ratified international treaty has been promulgated in the journal of laws of the it shall become part of the domestic legal order and shall be applied directly unless its application depends on the enactment of a statute an international treaty ratified after prior consent has been given in the form of a statute shall have precedence over statutes where the provisions of such a treaty can not be reconciled with their provisions where a treaty ratified by the establishing an international organisation so provides the rules it lays down shall be applied directly and have precedence in the event of a conflict of laws. the relevant part of section of the law on associations reads polish citizens shall exercise the right of association in accordance with the constitution and the legal order as specified by law the exercise of the right of association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary for ensuring the interests of national security or public order and for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the

declaration shall be binding on electoral colleges. the relevant part of section provided an electoral committee which has registered its regional electoral lists in at least half of the constituencies in the whole of shall be entitled to register a national electoral list the electoral committee s of organisations of national minorities shall be entitled to register a national electoral list provided they ha ve registered their regional electoral lists in at least five constituencies on and april the constitutional court dealt with an application by the president of the supreme administrative court naczelny sąd administracyjny seeking a universally binding interpretation of sections and of the elections act in its ruling the addressed among other things the following question whether it is implicit in the expression 'shall promptly acknowledge receipt of the declaration as used in section of the elections act that in order to issue such acknowledgment the state electoral college must verify whether an electoral committee that has submitted the declaration referred to in section of the act is in fact the electoral committee of a registered national minority organisation and may for the purposes of such verification require the committee to produce documents other than those listed in section i of the elections act such as the memorandum of association of the organisation the held as follows the state electoral college in performing its duties as set out in section of the elections act shall verify whether the declaration referred to in section of that act was submitted by the authorised electoral committee of one or more registered national minority organisations and may in case of doubt require documentary evidence of such authorisation. it further explained that it must be stressed at the outset that the basis for section of the elections act is to give polish citizens belonging to national minorities an equal opportunity to participate in representative bodies however the possibility provided by this provision for electoral committees of registered national minority organisations to take advantage of exemptions from electoral thresholds is an exception to the principle of equality of electoral rights in a material sense in practice the electoral committee that has submitted a given national minority list of candidates will participate in the distribution of seats in parliament despite the fact that its list has not attained the corresponding threshold this solution reflects a certain understanding of the equality principle that involves entities participating in elections being given equal opportunities this amounts to discrimination in favour of electoral committees of registered national minority organisations in comparison with other electoral committees since they constitute an exception to the equality principle provisions governing such discrimination can not be interpreted extensively secondly section reserves the privilege of exemption from electoral thresholds to lists of candidates supplied by the electoral committees of one or more registered national minority organisations and only committees of that type may submit corresponding declarations to the state electoral college the emphasis should be placed on both the reference to 'registered organisations of national minorities and to electoral committees acting in their name for this privilege is available to 'national minority organisations that are organised and act as such a condition of the validity and hence of effectiveness of a declaration seeking to take advantage of the exemption is that it must be submitted by an entity entitled to do so it is therefore the responsibility of that entity to provide documentary evidence of its entitlement to submit the declaration in practice this amounts to a responsibility to submit to the state electoral college documents unambiguously demonstrating that the electoral committee submitting the declaration is an entity entitled to do so that is to say the electoral committee of not just any organisation but of one or more registered national minority organisations in accordance with section the state electoral college is required to acknowledge without delay receipt of the declaration referred to in subsection in other words a declaration that has been submitted by an entity entitled to do so in that connection the college has a duty to verify whether the declaration was submitted by such an entity and if in doubt may require documentation unambiguously confirming the entity 's right to submit the declaration as the declaration gives rise to legal consequences so justifying the need for specific verification if such documents are not submitted the state electoral college is precluded from acknowledging receipt of the declaration referred to in section since apart from the requirement that it be made at the prescribed time to the appropriate electoral college a vital condition for the validity of the declaration is that it be made by an entitled entity on the other hand the state electoral college does not verify the content of the declaration for which the electoral committee takes full responsibility determining which documents are to be accepted by the state electoral college as confirmation of the electoral committee 's entitlement to submit the declaration referred to in section is a separate issue i t can be assumed that the state electoral college may require the presentation of appropriate documents such as a memorandum of association that will allow it unambiguously to ascertain that the entity submitting the declaration is the electoral committee of one or more registered national minority organisations. article of the civil code reads no one shall exercise any right held by him or her in a manner contrary to its socio-economic purpose or to the principles of co-existence with others zasady współżycia społecznego no act or omission matching this description on the part of the holder of the right shall be deemed to be the exercise of the right and be protected by law the relevant part of article provides a ny act which is contrary to the law or aimed at evading the law shall be null and void unless a statutory provision provides for other legal effects such as the replacement of the void

the case originated in an application no against the republic of bulgaria lodged with the court on march under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a bulgarian national mr kiril kostadinov ivanov the applicant the applicant was represented by mr k. kanev chairman of the bulgarian helsinki committee a non-governmental organisation based in sofia and by mr s. ovcharov a lawyer working with the bulgarian helsinki committee and practising in sofia on january the president of the section gave mr kanev leave to represent the applicants in all pending and future cases in which he personally acts as a representative rule a in fine of the rules of court the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agent ms r. nikolova of the ministry of justice in his original application the applicant alleged that a rally planned for september in whose organisation he had taken part had been banned by the authorities and that he had not had an effective domestic remedy in respect of that this he alleged had been due to the macedonian ethnic consciousness of the people who had intended to take part in it in follow-up submissions filed with the court on november the applicant alleged that another rally planned for september which he had also helped organise had been banned by the authorities for the same reasons on december the government were given notice of the application in his observations in reply to those of the government filed with the court on june the applicant in addition alleged that he had not had an effective domestic remedy in respect of the second rally either on april mr yonko grozev the judge elected in respect of bulgaria withdrew from sitting in the case rule accordingly on october the president selected ms maiia rousseva as ad hoc judge from the list of five persons whom the republic of bulgaria had designated as eligible to serve in that office article of the convention and rule a the applicant was born in and lives in blagoevgrad the background to the banning of the two rallies at issue in the present case has been set out in detail in the judgments in the following cases stankov and the united macedonian organisation ilinden v. bulgaria nos and echr united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v. bulgaria no october united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria no october ivanov and others v. bulgaria no november united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. no january united macedonian organisation

one of the applicants in united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov united macedonian organisation ilinden and others united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov no and united macedonian organisation ilinden and others no all cited above on september the applicant acting on behalf of the unregistered organisation the macedonian initiative committee notified blagoevgrad s mayor that the committee intended to stage a rally at p.m. on september in macedonia square to commemorate the eighty-second anniversary of the day of the genocide of macedonians in bulgaria september the rally would consist of the laying of wreaths and flowers and the reading of a short address the same day the mayor replied to the applicant that the rally could not proceed as the municipality had planned an event in macedonia square for the same date a concert marking the day of music that parallel event made the staging of the rally impossible on september again acting on behalf of the macedonian initiative committee the applicant sought judicial review of the mayor s decision he argued that under the applicable international-law agreements that organisation was entitled to stage peaceful rallies without being registered in a final decision of september the blagoevgrad district court held that the application was admissible and that the mayor s decision was amenable to judicial review however it went on to find that the mayor s decision was lawful because there was a risk that the rights and freedoms of others might be infringed it was not appropriate to hold the rally which in view of its intended theme was political in character alongside the municipality s event the performance of musical works could not at all be reconciled with political addresses it was not proper to force music lovers to listen to political speeches and declarations especially ones not accepted unequivocally by bulgarian society which was particularly sensitive to assertions that a macedonian minority existed in bulgaria and that its rights were being infringed as a result the macedonian initiative committee called off the rally the applicant submitted that he was not aware of whether the municipality s event had in fact taken place he had made a request for information in that connection under freedom-of-information laws but had not received a reply the municipality s cultural calendar for showed that the concert marking the day of music had been scheduled for october rather than september an earlier attempt by the united macedonian organisation ilinden ilinden an unregistered association based in south-western bulgaria in an area known as the pirin region or the geographic region of pirin macedonia to organise a similar rally on or september had also been fruitless blagoevgrad s mayor had banned that rally and a legal challenge to his decision had been dismissed by the blagoevgrad district court on september see united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov no cited above the circumstances relating to the rally organised by ilinden on september are set out in united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov no cited above in the following way on august ilinden notified the mayor of blagoevgrad of its intention to stage a rally on macedonia square in front of gotse delchev s monument at p.m. on september the event which was to mark the anniversary of ‘ the genocide against the macedonians would consist of the laying of a wreath and flowers on the monument and a short speech it would last one hour on august the mayor replied that the notification could not be examined as ilinden had not produced documents proving its official registration it was thus impossible to identify the ‘ managing bodies of the event moreover the municipality had planned an event on macedonia square for the same date a children s holiday under the name ‘ hello school to mark the beginning of the school year which made the holding of the rally impossible on august ilinden sought judicial review by the newly created blagoevgrad administrative court reiterating the arguments raised in its previous applications in a decision of august the blagoevgrad administrative court found that under the meetings and marches act which was lex specialis in relation to the general rules of administrative procedure the court competent to examine an application for judicial review of a mayor s decision to ban a rally was the district court it therefore sent the file to the blagoevgrad district court in a final decision of september the blagoevgrad district court dismissed the application it held that while the lack of registration did not amount to sufficient grounds to prohibit the rally the fact that another event likely to draw a number of people many of whom were children was due to take place on the same date in macedonia square was enough to justify the ban in the court s view it was inopportune to allow two wholly different events to be staged at the same time and place according to the applicants no school event took place at p.m. on september on macedonia square when a number of members and supporters of ilinden gathered in front of the american university in blagoevgrad at about p.m. they were stopped by the police and a number of them were arrested they were taken to a police station held for about three hours and charged with committing administrative offences for having tried to take part in a banned rally on october the deputy mayor of blagoevgrad imposed administrative punishments fines of bulgarian levs euros each on mr yordan kostadinov ivanov and on a number of members of ilinden for having taken part in a banned rally in breach of a public-order regulation issued by the blagoevgrad municipal council all of them sought judicial review in a series of judgments delivered on and february march and and may the blagoevgrad district court annulled the fines in some of the judgments it found that they were invalid as under the applicable rules the deputy mayor had no power to impose administrative punishments in other judgments the court found that the deputy mayor s decisions were defective because they did not specify which administrative offences had been committed in others it held that although the mayor s ban on the rally planned for september was legally binding the actions of the members of ilinden on that date had not amounted to the staging of a rally as they had been too few and had not tried to wave banners and make speeches but merely to lay flowers on gotse delchev s monument the court went on to say that every person regardless of their political convictions had the right to honour the memory of national heroes in peace. it was the applicant who acted on behalf of ilinden in its dealings with blagoevgrad s mayor and the courts in relation to that rally the relevant domestic law and practice have been set out in united macedonian organisation

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by mr tomasz bączkowski mr robert biedroń mr krzysztof kliszczyński ms inga kostrzewa mr tomasz szypuła and by the foundation for equality fundacja równości on december the applicants were represented before the court by professor zbigniew hołda a lawyer practising in the respondent government were represented by their agent mr jakub wołąsiewicz of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicants complained that their right to peaceful assembly had been breached by the way in which the domestic authorities had applied relevant domestic law to their case they alleged that they had not had at their disposal any procedure which would have allowed them to obtain a final decision before the date of the planned assemblies they also complained that they had been treated in a discriminatory manner in that they had been refused permission to organise the assemblies whilst other persons had received such permission by a decision of december the court declared the application admissible it decided to join to the merits of the case the examination of the government 's preliminary objections the applicants filed further written observations rule the applicants a group of individuals and the foundation for equality of whose executive committee the first applicant is also a member empowered to act on its behalf in the present case wished to hold within the framework of equality days organised by the foundation and planned for june an assembly a march in warsaw with a view to alerting public opinion to the issue of discrimination against minorities sexual national ethnic and religious and also against women and disabled persons on may the organisers held a meeting with the director of the safety and crisis management unit of warsaw city council during this meeting an initial agreement was reached as to the itinerary of the planned march on may mr bączkowski obtained an instruction of the warsaw mayor 's office on requirements which organisers of public assemblies have to comply with under the road traffic act should the assembly be regarded as an event impreza within the meaning of article of that act on may the organisers applied to the city council road traffic office for permission to organise the march the itinerary of which would lead from the parliament buildings sejm to plac defilad in the centre of on june the traffic officer acting on behalf of the mayor of warsaw refused permission for the march relying on the organisers failure to submit a traffic organisation plan projekt organizacji ruchu within the meaning of article a of the road traffic act which they had allegedly been ordered to submit on the same day the applicants informed the mayor of warsaw about stationary assemblies they intended to hold on june in seven different squares in four of these assemblies were intended to protest about discrimination against various minorities and to support actions of groups and organisations combating discrimination the other three planned assemblies were to protest about discrimination against women on june the mayor issued decisions banning the stationary assemblies to be organised by mr bączkowski mr biedroń mr kliszczyński ms kostrzewa mr szypuła and another person mr n. who is not an applicant who are active in various nongovernmental organisations acting for the benefit of persons of homosexual orientation in his decision the mayor relied on the argument that assemblies held under the provisions of the assemblies act of ustawa o zgromadzeniach had to be organised away from roads used for road traffic if they were to use roads more stringent requirements applied the organisers wished to use cars carrying loudspeakers they had failed to indicate where and how these cars would park during the assemblies so as not to disturb the traffic and how the movement of persons and these cars between the assembly sites would be organised moreover as a number of requests had been submitted to organise other assemblies on the same day the tenor of which ran counter to the ideas and intentions of the applicants permission had to be refused in order to avoid any possible violent clashes between participants in the various demonstrations on the same day the municipal authorities acting on the mayor 's behalf allowed the three planned assemblies concerning discrimination against women to be held as requested by the applicants on the same day the same authorities permitted six other demonstrations to be held on june the themes of these assemblies were as follows for more stringent measures against persons convicted of paedophilia against any legislative work on the law on partnerships against propaganda for partnerships education in christian values a guarantee of a moral society christians respecting god 's and nature 's laws are citizens of the first rank against adoption of children by homosexual couples on june despite the decision given on june the march took place it followed the itinerary as planned in the original request of may the march attended by approximately people was protected by the police in addition to the march nine stationary assemblies were held on the same day under permission granted by the mayor on june see paragraphs above appeal proceedings on june the applicant foundation appealed to the local government appeals board against the decision of june refusing permission for the march it was argued that the requirement to submit a traffic organisation plan lacked any legal basis and that the applicants had never been requested to submit such a document prior to the refusal it was also argued that the decision amounted to an unwarranted restriction of freedom of assembly and that it had been dictated by ideological reasons incompatible with the tenets of democracy on august the board quashed the contested decision finding that it was unlawful the board observed that under the applicable provisions of administrative procedure the authorities were obliged to ensure that parties to administrative proceedings had an opportunity of effectively participating in them in the applicant 's case this obligation had not been respected in that the case file contained no evidence that the applicant foundation had been informed of its procedural right to have access to the case file the board 's decision further read inter alia in the written grounds of the decision complained of the firstinstance authority refers to the fact that no traffic organisation plan is to be found in the case file under section a item an organiser of a demonstration is obliged to develop such a plan in cooperation with the police if he or she is required to do so by the authority however in the case file there is no mention that the organisers were obliged to submit such a plan the document on the procedure for obtaining permission to organise an event which was served on the organisers contained no information on such an obligation either having regard to the fact that the organisers request concerned a march to be held on june and that the appeal was received by the board 's office together with the case file on june the proceedings had already become devoid of purpose by that latter date. on june the applicants appealed to the mazowsze governor against the mayor 's refusals of june of permission to hold several of the planned assemblies they argued that the assemblies were to be entirely peaceful and that banning them breached their freedom of assembly guaranteed by the constitution they submitted that the assemblies did not pose any threat to either public order or morals they contested the argument relied on in the decision that they were required to submit a document on the planned itinerary between the places where the assemblies were to be held arguing that they only intended to organise stationary assemblies not any movement of persons between them and that they should not be held responsible for the organisation or supervision of such movement on june the mazowsze governor quashed the contested june refusals of authorisation to hold the assemblies it was first observed that these decisions breached the law in that the parties had been served only with copies of the decisions not with originals as required by the law on administrative procedure it was further noted that the mayor had informed the media of his decisions before they had been served on the applicants which was manifestly in breach of the principles of administrative procedure it was further observed that the assemblies act was a guarantee of freedom of assembly in respect of both the organisation of and participation in assemblies the constitution clearly guaranteed freedom of assembly not a right it was not for the state to create a right to assembly its obligation was limited to ensuring that assemblies were held peacefully thus the applicable law did not provide for any permit for the holding of an assembly the governor noted that the requirement to submit a permit to occupy a part of the road based on the provisions of the road traffic act lacked any legal basis in the provisions of the assemblies act the mayor had assumed that the demonstration would occupy a part of the road but had failed to take any steps to clarify whether this had really been the organisers intention which he was obliged to do by law it was further observed that a decision banning an assembly had to be regarded as a method of last resort because it radically restricted freedom of expression the principle of proportionality required that any restriction of constitutionally protected freedoms be permitted only in so far as it was dictated by the concrete circumstances of a particular case the governor noted in this connection that the mayor 's reliance on the threat of violence between the demonstrations organised by the applicants and the counterdemonstrations planned by other persons and organisations for the same day could not be countenanced it was tantamount to the administration endorsing the intentions of organisations which clearly and deliberately intended to breach public order whereas protecting the freedom of expression guaranteed by the assemblies act should be an essential task of the public powers he then discontinued the proceedings as they had become devoid of purpose the assemblies having taken place on june e siedlecka the assemblies act says that freedom of assembly can be restricted only if a demonstration might entail a danger to life or limb or a major danger to property did the organisers of the march write anything in their application that indicates that there is such a danger mayor of i do n't know i have n't read the application but i will ban the demonstration regardless of what they have written i am not for discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation for example by ruining people 's professional careers but there will be no public propaganda about homosexuality s. what you are doing in this case is precisely discrimination you are making it impossible for people to use their freedom only because of their particular sexual orientation mow i do not forbid them to demonstrate if they want to demonstrate as citizens not as homosexuals s. everything seems to suggest that like last year the governor will quash your prohibition and if the organisers appeal to the administrative court they will win because preventive restrictions on freedom of assembly are unlawful but the appeal proceedings will last some time and the date for which the march is planned will pass is this what you want mow we will see whether they win or lose i will not let myself be persuaded to give my permission for such a demonstration s. is it right that the exercise of people 's constitutional rights should depend on the views of the powers that be mow in my view propaganda about homosexuality is not to the same as exercising one 's freedom of assembly. article of the constitution reads freedom of peaceful assembly and participation in such assemblies shall be ensured to everyone limitations upon such freedoms may be imposed by statute article of the constitution which entered into force on october provides as follows in accordance with principles specified by statute everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed shall have the right to appeal to the constitutional court for a judgment on the conformity with the constitution of a statute or other normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the constitution. article of the constitution insofar as relevant provides as follows judgments of the shall be universally binding and final judgments of the shall be published without delay a judgment of the shall take effect from the day of its publication however the may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act such time-limit may not exceed months in relation to a statute or months in relation to any other normative act pursuant to section of the assemblies act everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly a gathering of at least fifteen persons called in order to participate in a public debate or to express an opinion on a given issue is to be regarded as an assembly within the meaning of the act under section freedom of assembly can be restricted only by statute and where it is necessary for the protection of national security or public safety for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others all decisions concerning the exercise of freedom of assembly must be taken by the local authorities in the municipality where the assembly is to be held these decisions can be appealed against to the governor under section of the act the municipality must be informed by the organisers of the intention to hold a public gathering in the open air for an indeterminate number of persons under section such information must be submitted to the municipality not earlier than thirty days before the planned date of the demonstration and not later than three days before it the information must include the names and addresses of the organisers the aim and programme of the demonstration its place date and time as well as information about the itinerary if the demonstration is intended to proceed from one place to another pursuant to section the municipality shall refuse permission for the demonstration if its purpose is in breach of the act itself or of provisions of the criminal code or if the demonstration might entail a danger to life or limb or a major danger to property a first-instance refusal of permission to hold a demonstration must be served on the organisers within three days of the date on which the relevant request was submitted and not later than three days before the planned date of the demonstration an appeal against such a refusal must be lodged within three days of the date of its service the lodging of such an appeal does not have a suspensive effect on the refusal of permission to hold the demonstration a decision given by the appellate authority must be served on the organisers within three days of the date on which the appeal was submitted under section of the road traffic act of as amended in the organisers of sporting events contests assemblies and other events which may obstruct road traffic are obliged to obtain permission for the organisation of such assemblies under section read together with section a of the act organisers of such events are obliged to comply with various administrative obligations specified in a list contained in that provision and numbering nineteen items including the obligation to submit a traffic organisation plan to the authorities these provisions were repealed as a result of the judgment of the referred to below in its judgment of january the constitutional court examined a request submitted to it by the ombudsman to determine whether the requirements imposed on organisers of public events by the provisions of the road traffic act were compatible with the constitution in so far as they impinged on freedom of assembly or whether they amounted to an excessive limitation of that freedom the observed that the essence of the constitutional problem was whether the requirements imposed by section of the act were compatible with freedom of expression as formulated by the constitution and developed by the assemblies act it noted that the assemblies act was based on the premise that the exercise of this freedom did not require any authorisations or licences issued by the state as it was a freedom the state was obliged to refrain from hindering its exercise and to ensure that it was enjoyed by various groups despite the fact that their views might not be shared by the majority accordingly the assemblies act provided for a system based on nothing more than the registration of the proposed assembly the court observed that subsequently when it enacted the road traffic act the legislature had incorporated various administrative requirements which were difficult to comply with into the procedure created for the organisation of sporting events contests and assemblies thus replacing the registration system by a system based on permission in so doing it placed assemblies within the meaning of the assemblies act on a par with events of a commercial character or organised for entertainment purposes this was incompatible with the special position that freedom of expression occupied in a democratic society and rendered nugatory the special place that assemblies had in the legal system under the constitution and the assemblies act the court also had regard to the fact that the list of requirements imposed by the road traffic act contained as many as nineteen sundry administrative obligations the restrictions on freedom of assembly imposed by that act were in breach of the requirement of proportionality applicable to all restrictions imposed on the rights guaranteed by the constitution the court concluded that section of the road traffic act was incompatible with the constitution in so far as it applied to

march the rsfsr ministry of justice registered the charter of the administrative centre of the religious organisation of jehovah 's witnesses in the on december the ministry of justice of the registered the charter of the administrative centre of the regional religious organisation of jehovah 's witnesses the applicant community which is the branch of the jehovah 's witnesses obtained legal-entity status on december from the moscow city justice department according to its charter the purpose of the applicant community was joint profession and dissemination of their faith and carrying on religious activity to proclaim the name of god the jehovah in the committee for the salvation of youth from totalitarian cults the salvation committee a non-governmental organisation aligned with the russian orthodox church filed a complaint against the members of the applicant community 's management with the savyolovskiy district prosecutor 's office in it alleged in particular that jehovah 's witnesses burdened their followers with exorbitant membership dues that put their families in a financially precarious situation and that they incited hatred toward traditional religions on august the prosecutor 's office refused to institute a criminal investigation finding no breaches of the community 's registered charter the constitution or other laws it was also noted that no complaints from private persons or legal entities concerning the activity of the applicant community had been filed in the salvation committee complained again and the inquiry into the same allegations was reopened on april the prosecutor of the northern district of moscow discontinued the investigation having heard several jehovah 's witnesses and completed a study of their literature the prosecutor found that the applicant community did not cause any harm to the health of citizens or their rights and did not incite citizens to refuse to fulfil their civil duties or commit disorderly acts following a third complaint by the salvation committee the prosecutor in charge of supervising compliance with laws on inter-ethnic relations in the general prosecutor 's office ordered the case to be reopened on september an investigator with the prosecutor 's office of the northern district of moscow again discontinued the investigation she scrutinised in detail the salvation committee 's allegations concerning the death of a jehovah 's witness who had refused a blood transfusion and accusations about alienation of family members resulting from their involvement in the religious activity of the applicant community the investigator established that no harm allegedly caused by the management of the applicant community to other persons could be proven following a fourth complaint lodged by the salvation committee the investigation was reopened on november the complaint was based on the same allegations as the previous ones on december the same investigator discontinued the proceedings for the same reasons as those set out in her earlier decision in particular she pointed out that the committee for the salvation of youth 's statements are based upon their active hostility towards this particular religious organisation whose members they the committee deny the mere possibility of exercising their constitutional rights because of their religious beliefs the salvation committee requested a new investigation for the fifth time the prosecutor 's office reopened the case and assigned it to another investigator on march on april the new investigator in charge of particularly important cases in the northern district of moscow terminated the criminal proceedings her findings in respect of substantially the same allegations were different however she found that jehovah 's witnesses alienated their followers from their families intimidated believers and controlled their mind as well as inciting them to civil disobedience and religious discord the investigator pointed out that the community acted in breach of russian and international laws but that no criminal offence could be established accordingly she discontinued the criminal case but recommended that the prosecutor of the northern district of moscow lodge a civil action for the applicant community to be dissolved and its activity banned on april the prosecutor of the northern administrative district of moscow filed a civil action for the applicant community to be dissolved and its activity banned the prosecutor 's charges against the applicant community were i incitement to religious discord ii coercion into destroying the family iii encouragement of suicide or refusal on religious grounds of medical assistance to persons in life- or healththreatening conditions iv infringement of rights and freedoms of citizens and v luring teenagers and minors into the religious organisation on september hearings before the golovinskiy district court of moscow began the presiding judge admitted several new witnesses for the prosecution and allowed the salvation committee to take part in the proceedings as a third party on the ground that it defends the rights of citizens overruling an objection by the defence on november the hearing was adjourned to february because the prosecutor was not ready on january the prosecutor filed a supplementary action based on the same allegations and corroborated by references to quotations from the religious literature of jehovah 's witnesses on february the proceedings resumed the judge reversed her previous decision and on a request by the defence removed the salvation committee as third party in the case the court proceeded to hear witnesses and experts on march the court stayed the proceedings the judge found that contradictions between the expert opinions submitted by the parties could not be resolved and ordered a new expert study of the applicant community 's religious beliefs the court appointed five experts two in religious studies two in linguistics and one in psychology and asked them whether the literature or materials of jehovah 's witnesses contained indications of incitement to religious discord coercion into destroying the family or infringements of the rights and freedoms of others the source material for the study included two volumes of evidence in the civil case literature and documents of jehovah 's witnesses and the synodal translation of the bible on october the five-expert composite study was completed on february the proceedings resumed and on february the district court gave judgment the golovinskiy district court heard over forty witnesses and experts and examined religious literature and documents it scrutinised the experts report and took their oral testimony a fifteen-page report by four experts endorsed the prosecutor 's allegations while the fifth expert dissented in a refutation of pages the court noted that he was the only expert who had ever observed how jehovah 's witnesses carry out their preaching work in different countries while the four other experts confirmed that they did not examine anyone belonging to the indicated group jehovah 's witnesses or potential members of jehovah 's witnesses as to the four experts conclusions the court also stated however not one of the experts including the psychologist could explain to the court on the basis of what objective information or research they came to this conclusion regarding the influence of the literature of jehovah 's witnesses on people 's perceptions it is simply the experts appraisal of this particular religious organisation and is not supported by any actual facts showing incitement to religious discord infringements of the personality and rights and freedoms of citizens etc. the district court also referred to the conclusions of an expert examination of april performed by the expert council for state expert examinations in religious studies at the ministry of justice the examination which was carried out at the request of the ministry of justice for the purpose of granting re-registration to the administrative centre of the jehovah 's witnesses in russia found with certain minor reservations concerning blood transfusion that jehovah 's witnesses teachings inflicted no harm on citizens the district court also had regard to the fact that in over religious entities of jehovah 's witnesses had obtained state registration in other russian regions the district court assessed the allegations advanced by the prosecutor and found that none of them had been based on any objectively verifiable facts the court 's examination of testimony by the prosecutor 's witnesses who spoke in support of the allegation of coercion into destroying the family established that the testimonies simply show the stand relatives take when a member of their family becomes a jehovah 's witness and when it is unacceptable from the relatives standpoint the district court determined that the other allegations were likewise unfounded facts indicating deliberate incitement to religious discord discrimination hostility or violence coercion into destroying the family infringements of the personality and rights and freedoms of citizens were not adduced by the prosecutor or established by the court t he court came to the conclusion that there is no basis for the dissolution and banning of the activity of the religious community of jehovah 's witnesses in moscow since it has not been established that this community in moscow violates the russian constitution or russian laws incites religious discord coerces members into destroying the family infringes the personality or rights or freedoms of citizens encourages others to commit suicide or to refuse medical care for individuals who are in a life- or health-threatening condition for religious reasons. on an appeal by the prosecutor on may the moscow city court quashed the judgment of february and remitted the claim for a fresh examination by a different bench the city court held that the district court had not properly assessed the circumstances of the case and that it should have ordered a new expert study in order to elucidate differences between the existing expert opinions on october a new law on freedom of conscience and religious associations the religions act entered into force it required all religious associations that had previously been granted legal-entity status to bring their articles of association into conformity with the act and obtain re-registration from the competent justice department on april the ministry of justice of the russian federation re-registered the administrative centre of the religious organisation of jehovah 's witnesses in as a centralised religious organisation on october the first application for re-registration of the applicant community was lodged with the moscow justice department on november the moscow justice department refused to examine the application on the ground that some documents were missing without specifying which documents these were on december and may a second and third application for re-registration were filed both of which were rejected by the moscow justice department on the same ground on october the second applicant mr chaykovskiy sent a written enquiry to the moscow justice department asking which documents were missing on the same day he brought an action against the moscow justice department before the presnenskiy district court of moscow seeking a court order to oblige the moscow justice department to consider the third application the court set a hearing date for november and requested the moscow justice department to provide a response by october on october the deputy head of the moscow justice department informed the applicant community that it had failed to submit the original charter and registration certificate of he also informed the applicants that he was under no legal obligation to specify the missing documents on october the applicants filed a fourth application which included the original charter and registration certificate on november the moscow justice department issued the first formal refusal of re-registration it referred to two allegedly incorrect wordings in the submitted documents the community had adopted rather than approved its charter and the organisation had indicated its legal address only but no location on december the fifth application was filed in which the two required wordings were used this was the last application because on december the time-limit for submitting applications for re-registration expired on january the moscow justice department issued the second formal refusal of re-registration in respect of the fifth application it based its decision on the fact that the proceedings to have the applicant community dissolved and its activity banned were pending before the golovinskiy district court of moscow on january the fifth applicant mr marchenko as an individual and founding member of the community filed a complaint with the kuzminskiy district court of moscow against the moscow justice department 's first refusal of november the court stayed the proceedings pending a decision of the presnenskiy district court on april the third applicant mr denisov filed a complaint with the butyrskiy district court of moscow against the moscow justice department 's second refusal of january the court asked for official information from the golovinskiy district court about the proceedings to dissolve the applicant community on september the kuzminskiy district court of moscow dismissed the fifth applicant 's complaints finding that the refusal of re-registration restricted only the rights of the community and not those of the fifth applicant himself on december the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal on october the butyrskiy district court of moscow dismissed the third applicant 's claim the court held that pursuant to section of the religions act re-registration could not be granted to organisations that might be liquidated or banned pursuant to section of the religions act the court added that the third applicant 's religious rights were not restricted by the refusal which had only entailed legal consequences for the community as a legal entity on february the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal on august the presnenskiy district court of moscow allowed the action in part the court found that the moscow justice department had wrongly requested the original documents copies of which had been available on file it held that the moscow justice department 's reference to ongoing proceedings before the golovinskiy district court was inadmissible because it had first invoked this argument before the court and had never referred to it as a ground for its earlier refusals the court declared the moscow justice department 's refusals unlawful but did not order re-registration of the applicant community on the ground that new application forms for religious organisations had been introduced and that the applicant community had to submit a fresh application for registration on an appeal by the applicant community on december the moscow city court upheld the decision of august it decided that the application for registration could not be processed not only because of the newly introduced application forms but also with regard to the ongoing proceedings in the golovinskiy district court on october a new round of proceedings began in the golovinskiy district court under a new presiding judge on november the hearing was adjourned following the adjournment the community of jehovah 's witnesses in collected signatures on a petition to protest against the prosecutor 's claim that she was protecting the rights of the community members copies of the petition were sent to the district court the president and the prosecutor general of the on an unspecified date in the district court ordered a new composite psycho-linguistic expert study of the applicant community 's literature and teachings the proceedings were stayed pending its completion on january the composite study was completed and its findings made available to the court following several oral hearings on march the golovinskiy district court of moscow decided to uphold the prosecution 's claim to dissolve the applicant community and to impose a permanent ban on its activities the district court found the applicant community responsible for luring minors into religious associations against their will and without the consent of their parents section of the religions act and for coercing persons into destroying the family infringing the personality rights and freedoms of citizens inflicting harm on the health of citizens encouraging suicide or refusing on religious grounds medical assistance to persons in life- or health-threatening conditions and inciting citizens to refuse to fulfil their civil duties section however the court found the applicant community not liable for extremist activity in the form of inciting religious discord with calls for violent acts section likewise it found unproven the allegation that the applicant community had collected contributions from its members for its benefit regarding the allegation of coercion into destroying the family the district court relied on the statements by seven family members of jehovah 's witnesses five of which were members of the salvation committee who had been unhappy about their relatives abidance by the religious norms their active involvement in the applicant community and their estrangement from non-religious family members thus one husband had blamed the applicant community for the collapse of his family life claiming that since his wife had joined the jehovah 's witnesses she fulfil led all their orders he c ould not discuss anything with her or even watch tv with her because of her comments on everybody including the leadership of the country and the orthodox church other witnesses complained that their adult children or in one case the daughter-in-law had spent less time caring for elderly relatives because they had been constantly busy within the community the district court further relied on the majority opinion of the expert study of october which determined that the texts of jehovah 's witnesses do not contain direct coercion into destroying the family but apply and propose for application direct psychological pressure which risks causing the destruction of families assessing the opinion by the dissenting expert and the findings of the new study of january which found no coercion into destroying the family the district court considered that these experts had limited the scope of their inquiry to publicly available literature of jehovah 's witnesses and had not analysed the actual activity of the moscow community or implementation of the religious commandments and recommendations in real life and their influence on family relations the district court rejected statements by the witnesses for the defence who had jehovah 's witnesses in their families and the conclusions of a sociological study of community members randomly selected conducted by the department of family sociology at the moscow state university on the ground that it had been based on the lists of respondents supplied by the community itself and failed to report a single instance of an internal family confrontation which objectively existed as to the charge of infringement of the personality rights and freedoms of citizens the district court firstly found a violation of the right to privacy in that the applicant community determined the place and nature of work of its members recommended that they engage in part-time employment so as to have time for preaching prohibited them from celebrating holidays or birthdays and required them to preach door to door thus also invading other people 's privacy as evidence of attempts to interfere with other people 's private life the district court referred to the criminal conviction of a mr k. for beating a female community member who had offered religious literature to his wife at their home moreover in the district court 's view the applicant community violated its members right to a free choice of occupation as it recommended that they engage in part-time employment and provided applications for voluntary service at bethel the community centre near where they only received a monthly living allowance and no salary the district court found a violation of the constitutional guarantee of equality between parents in relation to the upbringing and education of children article of the constitution because some parents involved their children in the religious activity of the applicant community without the permission of the other parent a non-member of the community it relied on the fact that there were pending custody disputes between parents in courts where religious education had been in issue it noted that where a witness parent had been represented in the custody dispute by a community-retained lawyer this amounted to a manifestation of interest in the outcome of the cases of the community itself and an interference with the family and private affairs of its members the district court also relied on the opinions of three psychiatrist witnesses for the prosecution who stated that the literal following of the bible principles as practised by jehovah 's witnesses restricted the person 's independent thinking and arrested psychological development in their view a child who did not celebrate holidays would become a social outcast and the community 's teachings hindered the development of patriotic feelings and love for the motherland the district court found that the applicant community violated the right to freedom to choose one 's religion by resorting to active proselytising and mind control according to the prosecution experts jehovah 's witnesses were set apart from traditional religions because of the theocratic hierarchy of the community their striving to integrate families into the life of a totalitarian non-secular collective and military-like discipline in domestic life the district court accepted the opinions of the prosecution experts and rejected the contrary conclusion in the expert study that the defence expert psychiatrist had conducted of community members on the grounds that participants had been selected from lists supplied by the organisations and that the study only concerned the community members whereas their relatives had not been examined the district court also considered that the petitions signed by the community members in its support had been evidence of the pressure that the community exercised on its members ruling on the charge of encouragement of suicide or the refusal of medical assistance on religious grounds the district court found that under the influence of the applicant community its members had refused transfusions of blood and/or blood components even in difficult or lifethreatening circumstances that finding was based on the following evidence the prohibition on blood transfusion contained in the literature of the applicant community the no blood card distributed within the community for the benefit of its members testimonies by community members who confirmed carrying such cards the existence of the hospital liaison committee with the applicant community and stories of patients who had refused a blood transfusion on religious grounds and whose refusal had been noted in their medical records the district court also had regard to a letter from the moscow health protection department that listed a number of instances in which patients had refused blood transfusions for themselves and in one case in respect of a newborn child even though the medical outcome of those cases was not specified the district court held that the proven fact of damage to the health of at least one individual was a sufficient ground for terminating the activities of the community it further noted the opinions of medical experts who clarified that bloodless surgery was a prospective trend in medicine but that in case of certain diseases the transfusion of blood or its components was still indispensable finally in the district court 's view the no blood card contravened the patient 's right to take medical decisions for himself by delegating that right in the eventuality of his being unconscious to his fellow believers as to harming the health of citizens the district court found that in addition to the prohibition on blood transfusion the activities of the applicant community had had a negative influence on the mental state and mental health of the followers this assessment rested on opinions of nonwitness family members who testified that they had seen sudden and negatives changes of personality in their relatives who had joined the applicant community and that many participants at religious meetings of jehovah 's witnesses had cried and had complained thereafter about colossal emotional exhaustion as to luring minors into the religious association the district court found on the basis of statements by two non-witness parents that where a witness parent involved the child in the activities of the applicant community there was an encroachment on the child 's freedom of conscience and the joint right of parents to participate in the child 's upbringing finally the district court found that the applicant community 's literature incited citizens to refuse to fulfil their civil duties. this included refusal to serve in the army and to perform alternative service and promotion of a disrespectful attitude towards state emblems the flag and the national anthem as well as a prohibition on celebrating state holidays the district court held that the interference with the applicant community 's rights was justified prescribed by law and pursued a legitimate aim because the applicant community had violated rights and freedoms of citizens and its activity led to the destruction of families encroachments on the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens and calls to refuse to perform duties to society taking into account that the applicant community violated constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens the contemplated restriction on its rights and termination of its activity is justified and proportionate to the constitutionally significant aims the applicant community was ordered to bear the costs of the expert studies of october and january and to pay costs of russian roubles to the state the applicant community appealed claiming in particular that the interference with its right to freedom of religion was not justified from the standpoint of articles and of the convention it also invoked articles and of the convention on june the moscow city court dismissed the applicants appeal in a summary fashion and upheld the judgment of the golovinskiy district court endorsing its reasons the no blood card referred to in the proceedings is a pre-printed foldable card that bears the words no blood in capital letters on the front page and empty fields to be filled out concerning the person s to be contacted in case of emergency and the holder 's allergies diseases and medicine s the text inside the card reads as follows medical

involvement of minors in religious associations as well as the religious education of minors against their will and without the consent of their parents or guardians section the founding documents of religious organisations that had been established before the religions act were to be amended to conform to the act and submitted for re-registration until so amended the founding documents remained operative in the part which did not contradict the terms of the act section re-registration of religious organisations was to be completed by december section with subsequent amendments the list of

provided without the consent of the individuals concerned if they suffer from highly contagious diseases grave mental disorders or if they have committed a criminal offence and been ordered to follow medical treatment by a judicial decision article on november the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld at final instance a judgment of the lower court by which the prosecutor 's request to liquidate the local organisation of jehovah 's witnesses had been refused one of the grounds advanced by the prosecutor in support of the liquidation claim was that a witness mother had refused a blood transfusion for her child the supreme court noted that the mother had refused a blood transfusion but had been in favour of blood substitutes which had been successfully used during surgery it also pointed out that the teachings of jehovah 's witnesses did not require believers to refuse blood but let everyone make an independent decision on that issue in the ontario supreme court in canada upheld a decision of the lower court to hold a medical doctor liable for administering blood transfusions to an unconscious patient carrying a card stating that she was a jehovah 's witness and as a matter of religious belief rejected blood transfusions under any circumstances malette v. shulman o.r it held in particular as follows the principles of self-determination and individual autonomy compel the conclusion that the patient may reject blood transfusions even if harmful consequences may result and even if the decision is generally regarded as foolhardy to transfuse a jehovah 's witness in the face of her explicit instructions to the contrary would in my opinion violate her right to control her own body and show disrespect for the religious values by which she has chosen to live her life the state undoubtedly has a strong interest in protecting and preserving the lives and health of its citizens there clearly are circumstances where this interest may override the individual 's right to self-determination for example the state may in certain cases require that citizens submit to medical procedures in order to eliminate a health threat to the community the state 's interest in preserving the life or health of a competent patient must generally give way to the patient 's stronger interest in directing the course of her own life as indicated earlier there is no law prohibiting a patient from declining necessary treatment recognition of the right to reject medical treatment can not in my opinion be said to depreciate the interest of the state in life or in the sanctity of life individual free choice and self-determination are themselves fundamental constituents of life to deny individuals freedom of choice with respect to their health care can only lessen and not enhance the value of life a landmark case from the united kingdom involved an adult daughter of a jehovah 's witness who had been prevailed upon by her mother to refuse blood transfusions for religious reasons in re t. adult refusal of treatment weekly law reports court of appeal lord donaldson gave the following summary of his opinion prima facie every adult has the right and capacity to decide whether or not he will accept medical treatment even if a refusal may risk permanent injury to his health or even lead to premature death furthermore it matters not whether the reasons for the refusal were rational or irrational unknown or even non-existent this is so notwithstanding the very strong public interest in preserving the life and health of all citizens however the presumption of capacity to decide which stems from the fact that the patient is an adult is rebuttable in some cases doctors will not only have to consider the capacity of the patient to refuse treatment but also whether the refusal has been vitiated because it resulted not from the patient 's will but from the will of others it matters not that those others sought however strongly to persuade the patient to refuse so long as in the end the refusal represented the patient 's independent decision if however his will was overborne the refusal will not have represented a true decision in this context the relationship of the persuader to the patient for example spouse parents or religious adviser will be important because some relationships more readily lend themselves to overbearing the patient 's independent will than do others in united states law the doctrine of informed consent required for any kind of medical treatment has been firmly entrenched since when justice cardozo on the court of appeals of new york described this doctrine as follows every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient 's consent commits an assault schloendorff v. society of new york hospital n.y. n.e the logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent that is to refuse treatment cruzan v. director mdh u.s. the following summary of the relevant case-law can be found in the case of fosmire v. nicoleau the state has a well-recognized interest in protecting and preserving the lives of its citizens a distinction should be drawn between the state 's interest in protecting the lives of its citizens from injuries by third parties and injuries resulting from the individual 's own actions see e.g. public health trust v. wons ehrlich ch j. concurring when the individual 's conduct threatens injury to others the state 's interest is manifest and the state can generally be expected to intervene but the state rarely acts to protect individuals from themselves indicating that the state 's interest is less substantial when there is little or no risk of direct injury to the public this is consistent with the primary function of the state to preserve and promote liberty and the personal

february supreme court of japan the relevant part of the report by the committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by member states of the council of europe monitoring committee doc march on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the stated the russian constitution safeguards freedom of conscience and of religion article the equality of religious associations before the law and the separation of church and state article and offers protection against discrimination based on religion article the law on freedom of religion of december has led to a considerable renewal of religious activities in according to religious organisations met in this law has opened a new era and led to a revitalisation of churches it was replaced on september by a new federal law on freedom of conscience and religious associations this legislation has been criticised both at home and abroad on the grounds that it disregards the principle of equality of religions in february the ombudsman on human rights oleg mironov also acknowledged that many articles of the law on freedom of conscience and religious associations do not meet russia 's international obligations on human rights according to him some of its clauses have led to discrimination against different religious faiths and should therefore be amended according to the regulations by the ministry of justice responsible for the implementation of the law on freedom of conscience and religious associations religious organisations established before the law came into force september had to re-register before december the registration process was finally completed on january as the state duma decided to extend the deadline twice about religious organisations and groups have been registered and only were refused their registration most of them because they failed to produce a complete file many others have for a variety of reasons failed to register the minister of justice mr chaika strongly rejected allegations that the orthodox church had exerted pressure on the ministry to prevent some religious organisations from obtaining their registration mr chaika also indicated that experts of the ministry had closely examined the status of the salvation army and the jehovah 's witnesses and had come to the conclusion that nothing prevented the latter 's registration at the federal level indeed there have been cases where even if a religious organisation had re-registered nationally local authorities created obstacles this has especially been the case with the jehovah 's witnesses whose congregation has long been the target of civil and criminal proceedings designed to prevent its activities the jehovah 's witnesses were registered at federal level in and its communities have also been registered throughout nevertheless the community in was forced completely underground and prevented from possessing properties and places of worship the civil trial against jehovah 's witnesses since has been considered by many as an important test case the co-rapporteurs thought then that the case has come to an end with a judgment issued on february dismissing the charges against jehovah 's witnesses however on may the moscow city court set aside this ruling and ordered the golovinskiy district court to hear the case once again the retrial started on october until a definitive ruling is reached jehovah 's witnesses in will be without registration and unable to profess their faith without hindrance the co-rapporteurs regard the length of the judicial examination in this case as an example of harassment against a religious minority and believe that after six years of criminal and legal proceedings the trial should finally be halted. resolution on the honouring of obligations and commitments by the russian federation adopted by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on april noted as follows however the assembly is concerned about a number of obligations and major commitments with which progress remains insufficient and the honouring of which requires further action by the russian authorities the assembly regrets the problems of the salvation army and jehovah

the case originated in an application no against the slovak republic lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the trade union of the police in the slovak republic odborový zväz polície v slovenskej republike and three individuals who are members of it the applicants on february the applicants were represented by mr i. syrový a lawyer practising in the slovak government the government were represented by their agent ms m. pirošíková the applicants alleged that their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and association had been breached as a result of statements made by the minister of the interior on march the application was communicated to the government it also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the trade union of the police in the slovak republic the first applicant is registered as a trade union of members of the police corps of the it is a legal person with its registered office in the application on its behalf was lodged by mr m. litva the trade union s president mr štefan dvorský the second applicant is a slovak national who was born in and lives in malacky at the relevant time he was vice-president of the first applicant association mr marián magdoško the third applicant is a slovak national who was born in and lives in prešov he is the first applicant s vice-president mr karol michalčík the fourth applicant is a slovak national who was born in and lives in he is a member of the first applicant association on october the first applicant of which nearly policemen were members at that time organised a public meeting in one of the main squares in its aim was to protest against envisaged legislative amendments concerning the social security of policemen and their low remuneration in its course the participants spontaneously shouted inter alia that the government should step down one of the banners displayed by the participants read if the state doesn t pay a policeman the mafia will do so with pleasure subsequently the minister of the interior criticised the meeting and its organisers he considered it to be an attempt to involve policemen in politics in particular because of the slogan calling for the government s resignation which he considered incompatible with the ethical code of the police apart from the public statements described below the minister of the interior on october removed mr litva the president of the first applicant from the post of director in the police force and assigned him to a different post as an ordinary policeman at an extra-ordinary general meeting of the police joint health insurance company held on november the third applicant was removed upon a proposal by the minister of the interior from the company s supervisory board the policeman who had carried the above-mentioned banner was summoned by the inspection service of the ministry of the interior and was asked to explain its content the applicants refer to the following public statements by the minister of the interior in particular in an article published on october in the daily newspaper sme the minister of the interior was quoted as saying that if anyone acted contrary to the ethical code of the police again they would be dismissed in an interview published in the same newspaper on october the minister stated that he did not challenge the policemen s right to elect their trade union representatives he expressed the view that nevertheless he was not obliged to negotiate with those representatives as they had lost credibility in a tv debate broadcast on october the minister of the interior stated among other things mr litva was demoted because he misled the public those policemen whom he had lured out to the square mr litva was not demoted because of his opinion but for having lied he lied in that he called into question the fact that the government had money at their disposal for increasing policemen s salaries the police corps of the is an armed security force as such it must remain strictly apolitical this means in practice as article of the ethical code of the police indicates that when expressing his or her views in public a policeman must act in an impartial and reserved manner so that there can be no doubt about his or her impartiality thus slogans calling for the government s resignation are in complete contradiction to that code i am telling you it will not be possible for excesses like the ones at that meeting to reoccur in the future this is what i guarantee to you if a policeman behaves in such a way in the future he or she will no longer be a policeman i still proceeded in a particularly moderate manner in this case where the sanction applied concerned mr litva exclusively. on december the applicants lodged a complaint with the they alleged a breach of articles and of the convention and their constitutional equivalents the applicants specifically referred to the above-mentioned statements of the minister of the interior which had been published in sme on and october and to the statements he had made in context of the tv broadcast of october in particular the applicants maintained that the minister s statements when considered in the light of his powers in respect of the police gave rise to a fear that members of the police force would be sanctioned for availing themselves of their freedoms of expression assembly and association there had been no breach of the ethical code of the police in the context of the public meeting organised by the first applicant the minister s statements had been repressive as he had indicated that he was not obliged to negotiate with the representatives of the first applicant those statements accompanied by the transfer of the president of the first applicant to a different position deterred the police from defending their rights through their trade union on october the found that the statements in question had not breached the applicants rights the judgment stated that the freedom of assembly and association under article of the convention and the ilo convention no extended exclusively to natural persons the minister s statements complained of could not therefore amount to a breach of that freedom in respect of the first applicant the considered that in the context of the meeting held on october the applicants had exercised their right to freedom of expression at the same time the second third and fourth applicants had exercised their right to freedom of association with others they had done so freely and independently of the will of the minister of the interior the minister s statements published in the media were to be understood as part of a dialogue between both parties who had thus been given the opportunity to express their opinions and standpoints admittedly the minister s statements could be characterised as bold and from a certain point of view capable of creating an atmosphere of fear however their nature and intensity were not such as to amount to a breach of the freedoms in issue the further held that the minister of the interior had been entitled to express his opinion on the situation within the ministry for which he was politically responsible his statements represented an immediate reaction to ideas and views expressed at the meeting those statements had not interfered with the applicants rights in issue they merely described a situation which might occur under specific circumstances however the was exclusively entitled to examine complaints of breaches of rights which were based on facts that had actually occurred in a separate opinion to the decision on admissibility one of the constitutional judges expressed the view that the applicants complaint should have been rejected for their failure to use the other remedies available namely to seek redress

democratic society for the protection of rights and freedoms of others the security of the state public order or protection of health and morals paragraph of article article provides that everybody

in st petersburg had been dissolved by a judicial decision because of gross violations of legal requirements on the number of members and the procedure for election of the management body finally the ministry of justice claimed that the applicant party had breached section of the political parties act in that the management bodies and audit commission had not been elected by secret ballot the applicant party objected to the ministry s claims it argued that neither the regional justice departments nor the ministry of justice itself had uncovered any defects in the documents when taking the decision to register the party in in the ministry had carried out an inspection of all regional branches of the party and found no major irregularities the allegation that the elections had not been by secret ballot was unsubstantiated because the documents reflected the outcome but not the procedure of the election on april the basmanniy district court of moscow granted the ministry s application it recalled that section of the political parties act required a political party to have no fewer than ten thousand members in at least one half of russian regions that is forty-five regions the applicant party had submitted for registration minutes of reorganisation of fifty-three regional branches having a total membership of persons the district court observed that an inspection by the ministry had revealed that twenty-five minutes of regional conferences had contained untrue information as per the above-cited list see paragraph above the district court further noted that regional branches in the kemerovo and leningrad regions and in st petersburg had been dissolved by a judicial decision on account of gross violations of legal requirements of minimum membership and the procedure for election of management bodies on the basis of those elements the district court reached the conclusion that the applicant party had submitted untrue information to the registration body and that at the date of its registration it had not had properly established regional branches in one half of russian regions or a ten-thousand-strong membership thus the applicant party did not meet the requirements for a political party within the meaning of section of the political parties act furthermore the district court considered it established that the applicant party s management and audit bodies had not been elected by secret ballot in breach of section of the political parties act in the district court s view that omission amounted to a gross and irreparable violation of the law because it put into doubt the legality of the management s decisions the district court further stated that section of the political parties act did not limit the scope of the competent authorities monitoring of the political parties compliance with the law to their compliance with the provisions of the said act the ministry of justice was right to apply for the applicant party s dissolution with a reference to the legal entities registration act on the ground of the breaches committed at the moment of the party s registration the court ordered that the applicant party be dissolved because of gross and irreversible violations of the law committed at the time of its registration on august the moscow city court in a summary fashion upheld the judgment of the basmanniy district court it rejected the applicant party s arguments in the following terms the arguments to the effect that the justice departments have previously carried out inspections of compliance by the conservative party of russia with the legislation and have not uncovered any violations do not undermine the district court s finding that violations were committed at the time of registration materials in the case-file prove the existence of such violations the fact that the registration authority had no comments on the documents submitted for registration at the time of registration only indicates that these violations had not been revealed at that stage it does not prevent the registration body from applying to a court with an application for dissolution of a legal entity if it discovered such violations at a later stage the appeal court does not agree with the argument that the violations could still be remedied the legal requirements concerning the minimum number of regional branches and party members should have been fulfilled already at the moment of registration of the political party the arguments that the violations which the ministry of justice referred to were not proven are similar to the arguments reviewed by the first-instance court these arguments are unsubstantiated and find no basis in the case materials. a political party must have regional

the case originated in four applications nos and against the republic of turkey lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a political party registered under turkish law refah partisi the welfare party hereinafter refah and three turkish nationals necmettin erbakan şevket kazan and ahmet tekdal the applicants on may the applicants were represented by mr yasar gürkan a lawyer practising in istanbul and mr laurent hincker a lawyer practising in strasbourg france the turkish government the government were represented by their co-agent mr ergun özbudun a university lecturer the applicants alleged in particular that the dissolution of refah by the turkish constitutional court and the suspension of certain political rights of the other applicants who were leaders of refah at the material time had breached articles and of the convention and articles and of protocol no to the convention the applications were transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the applications were allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule of the rules of court the chamber decided to join the applications rule by a decision of october it declared them partly admissible the government filed additional written observations on december a hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on january rule there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr özbudun and mr hincker refah was founded on july it took part in a number of general and local elections ultimately obtaining approximately of the votes in the general election of and about of the votes in the local elections of november the results of the general election made refah the largest political party in the turkish parliament with a total of seats in the grand national assembly out of altogether on june refah came to power by forming a coalition government with the centre-right true path doğru yol party led by mrs tansu ciller on may principal state counsel at the court of cassation applied to the turkish constitutional court to have refah dissolved on the grounds that it was a centre mihrak of activities contrary to the principles of secularism in support of his application he referred to the following acts and remarks by leaders and members of refah whenever they spoke in public refah s chairman and other leaders advocated the wearing of islamic headscarves in state schools and buildings occupied by public administrative authorities whereas the constitutional court had already ruled that this infringed the principle of secularism enshrined in the constitution at a meeting on constitutional reform refah s chairman necmettin erbakan had made proposals tending towards the abolition of secularism in turkey he had suggested that the adherents of each religious movement should obey the rules of their own organisations rather than turkish law on april necmettin erbakan had asked refah s representatives in the grand national assembly to consider whether the change in the social order which the party sought would be peaceful or violent and would be achieved harmoniously or by bloodshed at a seminar held in january in sivas necmettin erbakan had called on muslims to join refah saying that only his party could establish the supremacy of the koran through a holy war jihad and that muslims should therefore make donations to refah rather than distributing alms to third parties during ramadan necmettin erbakan had received the heads of the islamist movements at the residence reserved for the prime minister thus assuring them of his support several members of refah including some in high office had made speeches calling for the secular political system to be replaced by a theocratic regime these persons had also advocated the elimination of the opponents of this policy if necessary by force refah by refusing to open disciplinary proceedings against the members concerned and even in certain cases facilitating the dissemination of their speeches had tacitly approved the views expressed on may a refah mp i̇brahim halil çelik had said in front of journalists in the corridors of the parliament building that blood would flow if an attempt was made to close the i̇mam-hatip theological colleges that the situation might become worse than in algeria that he personally wanted blood to flow so that democracy could be installed in the country that he would strike back against anyone who attacked him and that he would fight to the end for the introduction of islamic law sharia the minister of justice şevket yılmaz a refah mp and vice-chairman of the party had expressed his support for the mayor of sincan by visiting him in the prison where he had been detained pending trial after being charged with publicly vindicating international islamist terrorist groups principal state counsel further observed that refah had not opened any disciplinary proceedings against those responsible for the above-mentioned acts and remarks on july principal state counsel submitted new evidence against refah to the constitutional court on august refah s representatives filed their defence submissions in which they relied on international human-rights-protection instruments including the convention pointing out that these instruments formed part of turkish written law they further referred to the case-law of the commission which had expressed the opinion that article of the convention had been breached in the cases concerning the turkish united communist party and the socialist party and to the case-law of the court and the commission on the restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of association authorised by the second paragraphs of articles and of the convention they contended that the dissolution of refah had not been prompted by a pressing social need and was not necessary in a democratic society nor according to refah s representatives was their party s dissolution justified by application of the clear and present danger test laid down by the supreme court of the united states of america refah s representatives further rejected principal state counsel s argument that the party was a centre of activities which undermined the secular nature of the republic they submitted that refah was not caught by the criteria laid down in the law on the regulation of political parties for determining whether a political party constituted a centre of activities contrary to the constitution they observed inter alia that the prosecuting authorities had not issued any warning to refah which had four million members that might have enabled it to expel any of its members whose acts had contravened the provisions of the criminal code refah s representatives also set out their point of view on the concept of secularism they asserted that the principle of secularism implied respect for all beliefs and that refah had shown such respect in its political activity the applicants representatives alleged that in accusing necmettin erbakan of supporting the use of force to achieve political ends and of infringing the principle of secularism the prosecuting authorities had merely cited extracts from his speeches which they had distorted and taken out of context moreover these remarks were covered by mr erbakan s parliamentary immunity they further noted that the dinner mr erbakan had given to senior officials of the religious affairs department and former members of the theology faculty had been presented by principal state counsel as a reception organised for the leaders of religious movements which had in any event been legally proscribed since with regard to the remarks of other refah leaders and members criticised by principal state counsel s office refah s representatives observed that these did not constitute any criminal offence they asserted that none of the mps concerned was authorised to represent refah or held office within the party and claimed that the prosecuting authorities had not set in motion the procedure laid down in the law on the regulation of political parties so as to give refah the opportunity if the need arose to decide whether or not the persons concerned should continue to be members of the party the first time refah s leadership had been informed of the remarks criticised in the case had been when they read principal state counsel s submissions the three mps under attack had been expelled from the party which had thus done what was necessary to avoid becoming a centre of illegal activities within the meaning of the law on the regulation of political parties on august principal state counsel filed his observations on the merits of the case with the constitutional court he submitted that according to the convention and the case-law of the turkish courts on constitutional law issues nothing obliged states to tolerate the existence of political parties that sought the destruction of democracy and the rule of law he contended that refah by describing itself as an army engaged in a jihad and by openly declaring its intention to replace the republic s statute law by sharia had demonstrated that its objectives were incompatible with the requirements of a democratic society refah s aim to establish a plurality of legal systems in which each group would be governed by a legal system in conformity with its members religious beliefs constituted the first stage in the process designed to substitute a theocratic regime for the republic in their observations on the merits of the case refah s representatives again argued that the dissolution of their party could not be grounded on any of the restrictions permitted by the second paragraph of article of the convention they went on to say that article of the convention was not applicable in the case as refah had nothing in common with political parties which sought to instal a totalitarian regime furthermore the plurality of legal systems which it proposed was actually intended to promote the freedom to enter into contracts and the freedom to choose which court should have jurisdiction on november principal state counsel submitted his observations orally on and november necmettin erbakan submitted his oral observations on behalf of refah in a judgment of january the constitutional court referring to article of the constitution ruled that the second paragraph of section of the law on the regulation of political parties was unconstitutional and declared it null and void that provision taken together with section d of the same law provided that for a political party to be considered a centre of activities contrary to the elementary principles of the republic its members had to have been convicted of criminal offences according to the constitutional court that statutory restriction did not cover all cases contrary to the principles of the republic it pointed out among other observations that after the repeal of article of the turkish criminal code activities contrary to the principle of secularism no longer attracted criminal penalties on january the constitutional court dissolved refah on the ground that it had become a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism it based its decision on sections b and of law no on the regulation of political parties it also ordered the transfer of refah s assets to the treasury as an automatic consequence of dissolution in accordance with section of law no in its judgment the constitutional court first dismissed the preliminary objections raised by refah in that connection it held that the parliamentary immunity of the mps whose remarks had been mentioned in principal state counsel s submissions of may had nothing to do with consideration of an application for the dissolution of a political party and temporary forfeiture by its members of certain political rights but was a question of the criminal responsibility of the mps concerned which was not a matter of constitutional law with regard to the merits the constitutional court held that while polutical parties were the main protagonists of democratic politics their activities were not exempt from certain restrictions in particular activities by them incompatible with the rule of law could not be tolerated the constitutional court referred to the provisions of the constitution which imposed respect for secularism on the various organs of political power it also cited the numerous provisions of domestic legislation requiring political parties to apply the principle of secularism in a number of fields of political and social life the constitutional court observed that secularism was one of the indispensable conditions of democracy in turkey the principle of secularism was safeguarded by the constitution on account of the country s historical experience and the specific features of islam the democratic regime was incompatible with the rules of sharia the principle of secularism prevented the state from manifesting a preference for a particular religion or belief and constituted the foundation of freedom of conscience and equality between citizens before the law intervention by the state to preserve the secular nature of the political regime had to be considered necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court held that the following evidence proved that refah had become a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism refah s chairman necmettin erbakan had encouraged the wearing of islamic headscarves in public and educational establishments on october at the party s fourth ordinary general meeting he had said when we were in government for four years the notorious article of the persecution torture code was never applied against any child in the country in our time there was never any question of hostility to the wearing of headscarves in his speech of december before the general election he had said university chancellors are going to retreat before the headscarf when refah comes to power but manifesting one s religion in such a manner amounted to exerting pressure on persons who did not follow that practice and created discrimination on the ground of religion or beliefs that finding was supported by various rulings of the constitutional court and the supreme administrative court and by the case-law of the european commission of human rights on applications nos and concerning the wearing of headscarves at universities the plurality of legal systems proposed by necmettin erbakan was nothing to do with the freedom to enter into contracts as refah claimed but was an attempt to establish a distinction between citizens on the ground of their religion and beliefs and was aimed at the installation of a theocratic regime on march mr erbakan had made the following speech to the national assembly ‘ you shall live in a manner compatible with your beliefs we want despotism to be abolished there must be several legal systems the citizen must be able to choose for himself which legal system is most appropriate for him within a framework of general principles moreover that has always been the case throughout our history in our history there have been various religious movements everyone lived according to the legal rules of his own organisation and so everyone lived in peace why then should i be obliged to live according to another s rules the right to choose one s own legal system is an integral part of the freedom of religion. in addition mr erbakan had spoken as follows on october at a refah party conference we shall guarantee all human rights we shall guarantee to everyone the right to live as he sees fit and to choose the legal system he prefers we shall free the administration from centralism the state which you have installed is a repressive state not a state at the people s service you do not allow the freedom to choose one s code of law when we are in power a muslim will be able to get married before the mufti if he wishes and a christian will be able to marry in church if he prefers. the plurality of legal systems advocated by mr erbakan in his speeches had its origin in the practice introduced in the first years of islam by the medina agreement which had given the jewish and polytheist communities the right to live according to their own legal systems not according to islamic law on the basis of the medina agreement some islamist thinkers and politicians had proposed a model of peaceful co-existence under which each religious group would be free to choose its own legal system since the foundation of the nizam party in dissolved by the decree of may mr erbakan had been seeking to replace the single legal system with a plurality of legal systems and thus destroy legislative and judicial unity which were preconditions for secularism and the consciousness of nationhood in addition mr erbakan had made a speech on april to the refah group in parliament in which he had advocated setting up a theocratic regime if necessary through force the second important point is this refah will come to power and a just social order adil düzen will be established the question we must ask ourselves is whether this change will be violent or peaceful whether it will entail bloodshed i would have preferred not to use those terms but in the face of all that in the face of terrorism and so that everyone can see the true situation clearly i feel obliged to do so today turkey must take a decision the welfare party will establish a just order that is certain but will the transition be peaceful or violent will it be achieved harmoniously or by bloodshed the sixty million citizens must make up their minds on that point. the reception given by necmettin erbakan at the prime minister s residence to the leaders of the various religious movements who had attended in vestments denoting their religious allegiance clearly evidenced refah s chairman s support for these religious groups vis-à-vis public opinion in a public speech in april şevki yılmaz mp for the province of rize had issued a clear call to wage a holy war jihad and had argued for the introduction of islamic law making the following declaration we shall certainly call to account those who turn their backs on the precepts of the koran and those who deprive allah s messenger of his jurisdiction in their country. in another public speech also in april şevki yılmaz had said in the hereafter you will be summoned with the leaders you have chosen in this life have you considered to what extent the koran is applied in this country i have done the sums only of the rules in the koran are applied in this country six thousand five hundred verses have been quietly forgotten you found a koranic school you build a hostel you pay for a child s education you teach you preach none of that is part of the chapter on jihad but of that on the amel-i salih peacetime activities jihad is the name given to the quest for power for the advent of justice for the propagation of justice and for glorification of allah s word allah did not see that task as an abstract political concept he made it a requirement for warriors cahudi what does that mean that jihad must be waged by an army the commander is identified the condition to be met before prayer namaz is the islamisation of power allah says that before mosques it is the path of power which must be muslim it is not erecting vaulted ceilings in the places of prayer which will lead you to paradise for allah does not ask whether you have built up vaulted ceilings in this country he will not ask that he will ask you if you have reached a sufficient level today if muslims have a hundred books they must give thirty to the koranic schools to train our children girls and boys and the sixty remaining books must be given to the political establishments which open the road to power allah asked all his prophets to fight for power you can not name a single member of a religious movement who does not fight for power i tell you if i had as many heads as i have hairs on my head even if each of those heads were to be torn from my shoulders for following the way of the koran i would not abandon my cause the question allah will ask you is this ‘ why in the time of the blasphemous regime did you not work for the construction of an islamic state erbakan and his friends want to bring islam to this country in the form of a political party the prosecutor understood that clearly if we could understand that as he did the problem would be solved even abraham the jew has realised that in this country the symbol of islam is refah he who incites the muslim community cemaat to take up arms before political power is in muslim hands is a fool or a traitor doing the bidding of others for none of the prophets authorised war before the capture of state power muslims are intelligent they do not reveal how they intend to beat their enemy the general staff gives orders and the soldiers obey if the general staff reveals its plan it is up to the commanders of the muslim community to make a new plan our mission is not to talk but to apply the war plan as soldiers in the army criminal proceedings had been brought against şevki yılmaz although his antipathy to secularism was well-known refah had adopted him as a candidate in local-government elections after he had been elected mayor of rize refah had made sure that he was elected as an mp in the turkish grand national assembly in a public speech on march and a television interview first recorded in and rebroadcast on november hasan hüseyin ceylan refah mp for the province of ankara had encouraged discrimination between believers and non-believers and had predicted that if the supporters of applying sharia came to power they would annihilate non-believers our homeland belongs to us but not the regime dear brothers the regime and kemalism belong to others turkey will be destroyed gentlemen people say could turkey become like algeria just as in algeria we got of the votes here too we will reach we will not remain on do not waste your energy on us– i am speaking here to you to those of the imperialist west the colonising west the wild west to those who in order to unite with the rest of the world become the enemies of honour and modesty those who lower themselves to the level of dogs of puppies in order to imitate the west to the extent of putting dogs between the legs of muslim women it is to you i speak when i say ‘ do not waste your energy on us you will die at the hands of the people of kırıkkale. the army says ‘ we can accept it if you re a supporter of the pkk but a supporter of sharia never. well you won t solve the problem with that attitude if you want the solution it s sharia. refah had ensured that ceylan was elected as an mp and its local branches had played videotapes of this speech and the interview refah s vice-chairman ahmet tekdal in a speech he made in while on pilgrimage in saudi arabia which was shown by a turkish television station had said that he advocated installing a regime based on sharia in countries which have a parliamentary regime if the people are not sufficiently aware if they do not work hard enough to bring about the advent of ‘ hak nizami a just order or god s order two calamities lie ahead the first calamity is the renegades they will have to face they will be tyrannised by them and will eventually disappear the second calamity is that they will not be able to give a satisfactory account of themselves to allah as they will not have worked to establish ‘ hak nizami and so they will likewise perish venerable brothers our duty is to do what is necessary to introduce the system of justice taking all these subtleties into consideration the political apparatus which seeks to establish ‘ hak nizami in turkey is the welfare party. on november the governor of kayseri province şükrü karatepe had urged the population to renounce secularism and asked his audience to keep their hatred alive until the regime was changed in the following terms the dominant forces say ‘ either you live as we do or we will sow discord and corruption among you so even welfare party ministers dare not reveal their world-outlook inside their ministries this morning i too attended a ceremony in my official capacity when you see me dressed up like this in all this finery don t think it s because i m a supporter of secularism in this period when our beliefs are not respected and indeed are blasphemed against i have had to attend these ceremonies in spite of myself the prime minister other ministers and mps have certain obligations but you have no obligations this system must change we have waited we will wait a little longer let us see what the future has in store for us and let muslims keep alive the resentment rancour and hatred they feel in their hearts. mr karatepe had been convicted of inciting the people to hatred on the ground of religion on may i̇brahim halil çelik refah mp for the province of şanlıurfa had spoken in parliament in favour of the establishment of a regime based on sharia and approving acts of violence like those which were taking place in algeria if you attempt to close down the i̇mam-hatip theological colleges while the welfare party is in government blood will flow it would be worse than in algeria i too would like blood to flow that s how democracy will be installed and it will be a beautiful thing the army has not been able to deal with members of the pkk how would it see off six million islamists if they piss into the wind they ll get their faces wet if anyone attacks me i will strike back i will fight to the end to introduce sharia. çelik had been expelled from the party one month after the application for dissolution had been lodged his exclusion was probably only an attempt to evade the penalty in question refah s vice-chairman the minister of justice şevket kazan had visited a person detained pending trial for activities contrary to the principle of secularism thus publicly lending him his support as a minister on the basis of the evidence adduced on july by principal state counsel s office the constitutional court held that the following further evidence confirmed that refah was a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism in a public speech on may necmettin erbakan had emphasised the importance of television as an instrument of propaganda in the holy war being waged in order to establish islamic order a state without television is not a state if today with your leadership you wished to create a state if you wanted to set up a television station you would not even be able to broadcast for more than twenty-four hours do you believe it is as easy as that to create a state that s what i told them ten years ago i remember it now because today people who have beliefs an audience and a certain vision of the world have a television station of their own thanks be to god it is a great event conscience the fact that the television channel has the same conscience in all its programmes and that the whole is harmonious is very important a cause can not be fought for without the support of television besides today we can say that television plays the role of artillery or an air force in the jihad that is the war for domination of the people it would be unthinkable to send a soldier to occupy a hill before those forces had shelled or bombed it that is why the jihad of today can not be waged without television so for something so vital sacrifices must be made what difference does it make if we sacrifice money death is close to all of us when everything is black after death if you want something to show you the way that something is the money you give today with conviction for channel kanal it was to remind you of that that i shared my memories with you that is why from now on with that conviction we will truly make every sacrifice until it hurts may those who contribute with conviction to the supremacy of allah be happy may allah bless you all and may he grant channel even more success greetings. by a decree of january the cabinet in which the refah members formed a majority had reorganised working hours in public establishments to make allowances for fasting during ramadan the supreme administrative court had annulled this decree on the ground that it undermined the principle of secularism the constitutional court observed that it had taken into consideration international human-rights-protection instruments including the convention it also referred to the restrictions authorised by the second paragraph of article and article of the convention it pointed out in that context that refah s leaders and members were using democratic rights and freedoms with a view to replacing the democratic order with a system based on sharia it held that where a political party pursued activities aimed at bringing the democratic order to an end and used its freedom of expression to issue calls to action to achieve that aim the constitution and supranational human-rights-protection rules authorised its dissolution the constitutional court observed that the public statements of refah s leaders namely those of necmettin erbakan şevket kazan and ahmet tekdal had directly engaged refah s responsibility with regard to the constitutionality of its activities it further observed that the public statements made by mps şevki yılmaz hasan hüseyin ceylan and i̇brahim halil çelik had likewise engaged the party s responsibility since it had not reacted to them in any way or sought to distance itself from them or at least not before the commencement of the dissolution proceedings as an additional penalty the constitutional court decided to strip necmettin erbakan şevket kazan ahmet tekdal şevki yılmaz hasan hüseyin ceylan and i̇brahim halil çelik of mp status in accordance with article of the constitution it found that these persons by their words and deeds had caused refah s dissolution the constitutional court also banned them for five years from becoming founder members ordinary members leaders or auditors of any other political party pursuant to article of the constitution judges haşim kılıc and sacit adalı expressed dissenting opinions stating inter alia that in their view the dissolution of refah was not compatible either with the provisions of the convention or with the case-law of the european court of human rights on the

doctor andreas hadjiloizou a pathologist practising in ayios dhometios on december it reads as follows mrs petrakidou visited me at my clinic on after she was released by the turks and complained of headaches difficulty in moving her head and pain in the right lower part of the arm following violent twisting from the examination it was established that she had mild concussion difficulty in moving her head and pain in the right lower part of the arm due to violent twisting she was advised to remain in bed for one week she has since visited me several times complaining of dizziness and headaches the second certificate was a medical opinion issued on an unspecified date by doctor simos nissiotis a specialist orthopaedic surgeon practising in it reads as follows the patient alkiviadous petrakidou marianna has been followed by me from for various problems that have been troubling her since the ill-treatment she was subjected to in the prisons of the turkish-cypriot pseudo-state in the patient participated in an anti-occupation demonstration on july and was arrested by the authorities of the pseudo-state during her arrest as well as during her detention she was beaten and ill-treated by the above authorities she was released on and was immediately taken to to be examined by doctors and to be administered medical treatment on july she visited me in my clinic for further examination and treatment she presented the following picture injury to the head concussion the patient had diffuse haematomas to the head and mainly in her hair and was complaining of headache and dizziness the patient seemed to be in a very bad shape and had a lot of phobias contusion of the nape the patient complained of pain and stiffness in the nape and the muscles of the nape were contracted the movements of the head bending extension and rotation were painful and limited and caused an aggravation of the headache and dizziness contusion of the right forearm the patient wore an elastic bandage on her right forearm and was complaining mainly of pain with movements in the extensor and flexor i removed the bandage and she had a haematoma in the area of the round extensor for the orthopaedic problems of the patient i recommended anti-inflammatory muscle relaxant and analgesic medicines i put her forearm in a special sock and recommended that after the acute phase approximately days she start doing exercise and swimming for her concussion i recommended that she avoid gazing fixedly and exposure to the sun the patient then returned to work on august though still having problems resulting both from her contusions and her concussion which however decreased in frequency with the passage of time ever since then and until today the patient has been suffering mainly from pain in the neck particularly in the cold months during these attacks she takes her medicines and the problems disappear this is due to the weakness of the muscles of the nape caused to her old injury as regards the problems resulting from her concussion her phobias and her psychological problems she is being treated by a specialist colleague from an orthopaedic point of view i recommend that she takes her medicines during attacks and that she swims in the summer in order to strengthen her muscular system this will help her to have rarer and milder attacks of neck pain. the applicant produced a photograph of herself with a bandage on her right arm this photograph was allegedly taken on her return home after her release by the authorities of the turkish republic of northern the trnc the government alleged that the applicant had participated in a violent demonstration with the aim of inflaming anti-turkish sentiment the demonstrators supported by the greek-cypriot administration were demanding that the green line in should be dismantled some carried greek flags clubs knives and wire-cutters they were acting in a provocative manner and shouting abuse the demonstrators were warned in greek and english that unless they dispersed they would be arrested in accordance with the laws of the trnc the applicant was arrested by the turkish-cypriot police after crossing the un buffer zone and entering the area under turkish-cypriot control the turkish-cypriot police intervened in the face of the manifest inability of the greek-cypriot authorities and the un force in to contain the incursion and its possible consequences no force was used against demonstrators who did not intrude into the trnc border area and in the case of demonstrators who were arrested for violating the border no more force was used than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances in order to arrest and detain the persons concerned no one was ill-treated it was possible that some of the demonstrators had hurt themselves in the confusion or in attempting to scale barbed wire or other fencing had the turkish police or anyone else assaulted or beaten any of the demonstrators the un secretary general would no doubt have referred to this in his report to the security council the applicant was charged tried found guilty and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment she pleaded not guilty but did not give evidence and declined to use the available judicial remedies she was asked if she required assistance from a lawyer registered in the trnc but refused and did not ask for legal representation interpretation services were provided at the trial by qualified interpreters all the proceedings were translated into greek in his report of december on the un operations in the un secretary general stated inter alia a serious situation however arose in july as a result of a demonstration by greek cypriots in the details are as follows a in the evening of july some greek cypriot demonstrators mostly women forced their way into the un buffer zone in the ayios kassianos area of the demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by unficyp and destroyed an unficyp observation post they then broke through the line formed by unficyp soldiers and entered a former school complex where unficyp reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further a short while later turkish-cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended persons of them women b the ayios kassianos school complex is situated in the un buffer zone however the turkish forces claim it to be on their side of the cease-fire line under working arrangements with unficyp the turkish-cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions this patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last may c in the afternoon of july some greek cypriots gathered at the main entrance to the un protected area in in which the un headquarters is located to protest the continuing detention by the turkish-cypriot authorities of those apprehended at ayios kassianos the demonstrators whose number fluctuated between and blocked all un traffic through this entrance until july when the turkish-cypriot authorities released the last two detainees d the events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made both at the un headquarters and at to contain and resolve the situation on july i expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the un buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated i also urged the turkish-cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained on july the president of the security council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties on behalf of the members of the council the council s deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of july he also stressed the need strictly to respect the un buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained he asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations. the applicant produced photographs taken at different times during the demonstration on july photographs to were intended to show that notwithstanding the deployment of the turkish-cypriot police the demonstration was peaceful in photographs to members of the turkish-cypriot police are seen breaking up the unficyp cordon the final set of photographs show members of the turkish-cypriot police using force to arrest some of the women demonstrators the english translation of the trnc nicosia district court judgment of july indicates that the applicant together with other women was charged with two offences entering trnc territory without permission contrary to sections and of law no see paragraph below and entering trnc territory other than through an approved port contrary to subsections and of the aliens and immigration law see paragraph below the judgment was given in the presence of the accused and of an interpreter who was reminded of his oath the trial judge noted the following i the accused did not accept the charges against them and stated that they did not wish to use the services of a lawyer registered in the trnc ii the public prosecutor called seven witnesses whose statements were translated into greek for the accused s benefit iii the witnesses mainly police officers on duty at the time of the demonstration declared that the accused had illegally entered the trnc buffer zone shouted abuse at the turkish-cypriot forces resisted arrest by pulling and pushing knives and other cutting objects had been found in the bags of some of the demonstrators who had been arrested vi the accused had been told that they could cross-examine witnesses in turn and if they wished choose one of their number to cross-examine the witnesses on behalf of all the accused however they did not do so some of the accused including the applicant put questions to the prosecution witnesses most of the accused women did not make use of their right of cross-examination v the applicant made the following statement i consider our arrest as illegal because we were arrested while we were on a territory which however you look at it is hellenic by troops we do not recognise we had come in peace but were faced by violence not by the turkish army but by the turkish cypriots who until then we had considered as brothers vi some of the other women accused gave statements declaring that the demonstration was peaceful that they had not carried weapons and that they did not recognise the trnc as a valid state vii relying on the statements of the prosecution witnesses the trnc district court came to the conclusion that the accused had crossed the borders of the trnc at an unapproved entry point and without permission and had resisted by various means the un and turkish forces which had tried to stop them the statements made by some of the accused were mainly of a political nature and did not undermine the statements of the prosecution witnesses viii the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt so that the accused were guilty on both counts ix in deciding on the sentence the trnc district court had taken into account the seriousness of the offence and the fact that the accused had shown no remorse and continued to deny the validity of the trnc section of the cypriot criminal code reads as follows where five or more persons assembled with intent to commit an offence or being assembled with intent to carry out some common purpose conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace or will by such assembly needlessly and without any reasonable occasion provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace they are an unlawful assembly it is immaterial that the original assembling was lawful if being assembled they conduct themselves with a common purpose in such a manner as aforesaid when an unlawful assembly has begun to execute the purpose whether of a public or of a private nature for which it assembled by a breach of the peace and to the terror of the public the assembly is called a riot and the persons assembled are said to be riotously assembled. according to section of the criminal code any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to imprisonment for one year section of the criminal code provides any person who carries in public without lawful occasion any offensive arm or weapon in such a manner as to cause terror to any person is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years and his arm or weapons shall be forfeited. according to section of the criminal code it is an offence to carry a knife outside the home the relevant part of chapter section of the criminal procedure law states any officer may without warrant arrest any person b who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment c who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty section of law no states any person who enters a prohibited military area without authorization or by stealth or fraudulently shall be tried by a military court in accordance with the military offences act those found guilty shall be punished. subsections and of the aliens and immigration law read as follows no person shall enter or leave the colony except through an approved port any person who contravenes or fails to observe any of the provisions of subsections or of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to

subversive activities within the cpl/cpsu up until the failed coup in august xvii the cpl/cpsu was thus recognised as an anti-state organisation within the meaning of article of the criminal code as then in force see paragraph below similarly the lssr citizens committee the lssr party s interior committee the association of free businessmen the radio station soviet lithuania the workers vigilance committees the congress of democratic forces of lithuania and the lithuanian national rescue committee were also recognised as such organisations the cpl/cpsu having set up or controlled all of them

capacity as a member of the central committee of the cpl/cpsu and director of the radio station soviet lithuania he had participated in the activities of anti-state organisations between march and august he had been responsible for broadcasting various transmissions urging inter alia the forceful overthrow of the lawful government of lithuania and the abolition of the sovereignty of the the

various types of bodily harm during the events the other three co-defendants were also convicted on february the court of appeal amended the applicants conviction under article of the then criminal code insofar as it related to their activities in the cpl/cpsu and its subsidiary organisations between march and november the court of appeal found that prior to the legislative amendment of november article of the criminal code dealt with the activities of anti-soviet organisations and could not be applied by analogy to the activities of anti-lithuanian organisations however in view of the legislative amendment criminal responsibility was thereafter clearly established by article for actions directed against the sovereignty of the see paragraph below the court therefore held that the domestic criminal law did not provide for criminal responsibility on the ground of the applicants membership of the cpl/cpsu until november and that they could only be convicted for their activities within that party and other anti-state organisations after that date the appellate court also quashed the third applicant s conviction insofar as it related to complicity in causing medium and mild bodily harm articles and of the then criminal code in conjunction with article in view of the expiry of the statutory time-limit for bringing criminal proceedings in respect of those offences his conviction remained insofar as it related to his being an accomplice to aggravated murder and causing serious bodily harm articles and of the then criminal code in conjunction with article the first and the third applicants convictions under article of the code and their sentences remained unchanged the second applicant s sentence was reduced to one year and six months imprisonment the court of appeal otherwise confirmed a substantial part of the first instance court s findings and held that under international law the new government of lithuania had had legitimate authority as of march over the territory of lithuania and that the occupation and annexation by the soviet union for over years had been annulled as of that date the later recognition of this fact by foreign states merely acknowledged the existing reality the fact that it took the new government time to replace the previous soviet structures of the state did not imply any continued dependence on the however the applicants being leading anti-state activists and communist party executives had unlawfully sought to overturn the lithuanian government and re-instate soviet power on december the supreme court dismissed the applicants cassation appeals that decision was final the first applicant s attempts to obtain release on licence were to no avail it seems he was eventually released on august on an unspecified date the second applicant was also released from prison after having served his sentence the third applicant was released on january the act on the re-establishment of the state of

council and was not referred to again in official documents taking into account the fact that the delegation did not agree to sign a protocol for the start of interstate negotiations the supreme council renounced the principles laid down for that procedure including the conditional moratorium it envisaged the possibility that negotiations could nevertheless start without signing a protocol but only if the sovereignty of the state of lithuania were not violated in view of the response given by the majority of the lithuanian population in a nation wide referendum on february the supreme council adopted a law stating that the notion that the lithuanian state is an independent and democratic republic was a basic constitutional principle on january the supreme council adopted a decision on the so-called lithuanian national rescue committee in which it declared its creation and actions to be anti-constitutional subversive and thus illegal. on august the supreme council adopted a decision confirming the illegality of the cpl/cpsu the applicants were convicted under the criminal code which had been adopted by the supreme council of the lssr on june and which continued to apply to the with numerous amendments until the entry into force of a new criminal code on on the basis of the provisional basic law of march the provisions of the criminal code hereafter the cc were deemed to apply following the re-establishment of s independence as long as those provisions were compatible with that legislation see paragraph above article of the cc dealt with issues of complicity article of the cc punished anti-soviet agitation and propaganda it penalised inter alia especially serious crimes against the and the propagation of anti-soviet defamatory fiction by a legislative amendment of october which came into force on november article of the cc was rephrased specifying the criminalisation of acts directed against the sovereignty of the paragraph of that article punished such acts if committed at the request of a foreign state or organisation with up to years imprisonment article of the cc prohibited the creation of and active participation in anti-soviet organisations with a view to preparing or committing especially serious crimes against the state following the legislative amendment of november article of the cc was rephrased to prohibit participation in acts aimed at disturbing the public or social order established by the provisional basic law the constitution to limit the sovereign powers of the lithuanian state or to separate any part of its territory by force prior to these amendments to the criminal code on may the law on the rehabilitation of persons repressed for resistance to the former occupying regimes was adopted by the supreme council thereby those persons who had been convicted under the previous anti-soviet version of articles and of the cc were declared innocent in the eyes of the and their civil rights restored to them article of the cc punished acts of aggravated murder article of the cc punished acts causing serious bodily harm the committee on legal affairs and human rights of the parliamentary assembly monitored the human rights situation in which process included a visit by a delegation to that country and a meeting with the third applicant in lukiškės prison the rapporteur commented afterwards in his report of january as/jur that the main conclusion to be drawn is that justice can not be used as a means of mastering recent history concerning which very little research exists there is a great danger of inspiring and feeding a desire for revenge in the national conscious and unconscious thus bringing about new injustices for example it is impossible to determine the degree of independence and hence the responsibility of a provincial communist party leader before historical research has been done to assess the decision-making autonomy and the real powers of such an official under the communist party system that prevailed in the former soviet union,case originated three applications nos republic lithuania lodged court article convention protection human rights

archdiocese to submit a report on its revenues and expenditure to the assembly of priests and ţ ask the archdiocesan council to notify it on a quarterly or annual basis of any decisions relating to appointments transfers and allocation of budgetary resources. in accordance with the trade unions act law no the union s elected president applied to the craiova court of first instance for the union to be granted legal personality and entered in the register of trade unions submitting that the application for registration was in conformity with that act and that the formation of a trade union was not prohibited by the religious freedom act law no the public prosecutor s office representing the state in the proceedings supported the application for registration submitting that the establishment of a trade union for members of the clergy and lay staff was not in breach of any provision of the law it added that since the union s members were employees working under contracts of employment they were entitled like any other employees to join together as part of a trade union to defend their rights the archdiocese of craiova intervening in the proceedings as a third party confirmed that the union s members were employed by the archdiocese but argued that the establishment of the union without the archbishop s consent and blessing permission was prohibited by the statute of the romanian orthodox church as approved by government ordinance no it added that the statute barred priests from taking part in proceedings in the civil courts even in connection with personal disputes without the archbishop s prior written permission pointing out that priests chaired parish assemblies and governing bodies the archdiocese submitted that they were thus unable to form trade unions since the trade unions act prohibited anyone performing management functions from doing so lastly it produced written statements from eight members of the union indicating that they no longer wished to be part of it having observed that the application for registration satisfied the formal requirements of the trade unions act the court decided that the application should be examined in the light of articles and of that act article of the labour code article of the constitution article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the european convention on human rights in a judgment of may the court allowed the union s application and ordered its entry in the register of trade unions thereby granting it legal personality the relevant passages of the judgment read as follows the third party submits that the application to form the trade union infringes both the special legislation on religious freedom and the legal status of religious denominations and also in the absence of any blessing from the archbishop or of any prior written permission to take part in court proceedings a requirement that applies even to personal disputes the statute of the romanian orthodox church having regard to the provisions of the church s statute and of the religious freedom act law no the court dismisses the third party s arguments as unfounded for the reasons set out below the court notes that pursuant to section of law no religious communities associations and groups are required to observe the constitution and their activities must not threaten national security public order public health and morals or fundamental rights and freedoms the court further observes that the statute of the church as approved by government ordinance no does not expressly forbid the establishment of a trade union for clergy and lay staff in accordance with labour legislation the third party which contends that the right to form a trade union is subject to receiving the archbishop s blessing has not disputed that the union s founding members are contractual employees the third party s arguments have been analysed in the light of both sections to of the religious freedom act which acknowledges the important role of the romanian orthodox church and its organisational and operational autonomy and section of the same act which provides that ‘ no one shall be prevented from or coerced into embracing a religious opinion or faith contrary to his or her beliefs and that ‘ no one shall suffer discrimination or persecution or be placed in an inferior position on account of his or her faith membership or non-membership of a religious denomination group or association or for exercising freedom of religion in accordance with the law in so far as members of the clergy and laity are recognised as employees they have the statutory right to form a trade union this right can not be subject to any restrictions based on religious affiliation or to prior consent from the hierarchy in the court s opinion the principle of hierarchical subordination and obedience set forth in the statute can not be used as a basis for restricting the right to form a trade union the only permissible restrictions in this sphere must be prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security public safety the prevention of disorder or crime the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others the third party s argument that the applicants did not obtain the archbishop s permission to take part in proceedings in the civil courts must likewise be dismissed given that article of the constitution provides ‘ everyone shall be entitled to apply to the courts for protection of his rights freedoms or legitimate interests the exercise of this right shall not be restricted by any statute. the establishment of a trade union does not necessarily indicate the existence of a dissident strand within the romanian orthodox church with a disregard for hierarchy and the rules imposed by the church on the contrary it is likely to contribute to employer-employee dialogue on such matters as negotiation of employment contracts observance of working and non-working hours and the rules on remuneration protection of health and safety at work vocational training medical cover and the opportunity to elect representatives and stand for election to decision-making bodies with due regard for the special characteristics of the church and its religious spiritual cultural educational social and charitable purpose having regard to the foregoing in accordance with section of law no the court allows the application dismisses the objection by the third party grants legal personality to the union and orders its entry in the register of trade unions. the archdiocese challenged that judgment arguing that the provisions of domestic and international law on which it was based were not applicable to the case at hand relying on article of the constitution which guarantees religious freedom and the autonomy of religious communities it contended that the principle of religious freedom could not be overridden by other constitutional principles such as freedom of association including the right to organise it submitted that the emergence within the structure of the church of a trade union-type organisation for members of the clergy would seriously imperil the freedom of religious denominations to organise themselves in accordance with their own traditions the first-instance court s judgment had added a new institution to the existing church institutions namely a trade union for priests thereby jeopardising the autonomy of religious communities as guaranteed by the constitution the archdiocese also criticised the applicant union s stated aims contending that they conflicted with the duties that were set out in the job description and accepted by priests by virtue of their vow of faith it pointed out that upon ordination all priests had undertaken to abide by all the provisions of the church s statute the rules of procedure of the church s disciplinary and judicial bodies and the decisions of the holy synod of the romanian orthodox church local church assemblies and the parish council in june the holy synod declared that initiatives by priests from various regions of the country to set up trade unions were in breach of the law the canons and the church s statute in a final judgment of july the dolj county court allowed the appeal by the archdiocese and revoked the registration of the trade union the relevant passages of the judgment read as follows the romanian orthodox church is organised and operates in accordance with its statute as approved by government ordinance no the statute prohibits priests from setting up associations foundations or organisations of any kind and hence trade unions this prohibition is designed to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the romanian orthodox church by allowing it to preserve the orthodox tradition and its founding tenets by virtue of section of law no internal regulations may not contain any provisions that are in breach of the constitution or the law the establishment of a trade union would result in the consultative and deliberative bodies provided for by the statute being replaced by or obliged to work together with a new body the trade union not bound by the traditions of the church and the rules of canon law governing consultation and decision-making the freedom to organise religious communities is recognised by the constitution and law no on religious freedom and the legal status of religious denominations each denomination draws up its own statutes governing its internal organisation its members rights and obligations its decision-making procedures and the operation of its disciplinary bodies pursuant to article w of the statute of the orthodox church the holy synod takes decisions concerning the establishment operation or dissolution of national ecclesiastical associations and foundations set up and managed by the romanian orthodox church it grants or denies permission for the establishment operation or dissolution of ecclesiastical associations and foundations which have their own governing bodies and operate within the territorial subdivisions of the romanian orthodox patriarchate it follows from the above-mentioned provisions which make no reference to trade unions that the associations and foundations must be ecclesiastical and national in nature it also follows from article e of the statute of the orthodox church that priests may not represent their parishes in court proceedings without the bishop s prior written consent similarly in view of the oath of obedience towards the bishop which they took upon ordination members of the clergy may not take part in court proceedings concerning personal matters without the bishop s prior written permission law no provides that persons performing management functions or functions involving the exercise of public authority the judiciary the military the police and members of the special forces may not set up trade unions in the present case the statute defines the parish which is a subdivision of the orthodox church as a community of orthodox christians both clergy and laity established within a specified geographical area under the ecclesiastical legal administrative and economic authority of the diocese and led by a priest an examination of the list of priests involved in the present case reveals that they chair their parish assemblies and councils since they perform management functions and receive stipends on that account in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions they may not form trade unions having regard to the foregoing the court allows the appeal quashes the judgment and refuses the application for registration of the trade union. on september the attempt to set up the applicant union was discussed within the synod of the metropolis of oltenia the synod decided that if the union s members were to lodge an application with the court they should be punished and referred to the disciplinary bodies as a result the members concerned were summoned to the archdiocese headquarters where some of them signed declarations to the effect that they no longer wished to pursue the application in a letter of june the chancery of the romanian orthodox patriarchate reminded the archdiocese that priests were forbidden to apply to domestic and international courts without the consent of their hierarchy and asked it to obtain written declarations from the priests in question stating that they no longer wished to pursue the application and in the event of their refusal to refer them to the appropriate disciplinary bodies some of the priests despite having signed the declarations informed the court that they intended to pursue the application lodged on behalf of the union on april three priests who had been members of the applicant union set up an association called apostolia together with five other people the association received the approval of the archbishop of craiova who made premises available for use as its headquarters it was registered with the craiova court of first instance on june the association s aims as set out in its constitution are to educate the people in the spirit of orthodox morality to promote a sense of solidarity between the clergy and the faithful to raise funds for the publication of documents to defend the faith and

diocese had complied with these rules in three decisions delivered on june july and april the constitutional court acknowledged that the existence of internal disciplinary bodies within religious communities and the fact that their decisions could not be challenged in the civil courts amounted to a restriction of the right of access to a court but held that the restriction was justified by the

were those concerning criminal offences the relevant provisions of convention no of the international labour organisation ilo on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise adopted

workers in an employment relationship the determination of the existence of such a relationship should be guided primarily by the facts relating to the performance of work and the remuneration of the worker notwithstanding how the relationship is characterized in any contrary arrangement contractual or otherwise that may have been agreed between the parties for the purpose of facilitating the determination of the existence of an employment relationship members should within the framework of the national policy referred to in this recommendation consider the possibility of the following members should consider the possibility of defining in their laws and regulations or by other means specific indicators of the existence of an employment relationship those indicators might include romania ratified the revised european social charter on may article of the charter concerning the right to organise is worded as follows with a view to ensuring or promoting the freedom of workers and employers to form local national or international organisations for the protection of their economic and social interests and to join those organisations the contracting parties undertake that national law shall not be such as to impair nor shall it be so applied as to impair this freedom the extent to which the guarantees provided for in this article shall apply to the police shall be determined by national laws or regulations the principle governing the application to the members of the armed forces of these guarantees and the extent to which they shall apply to persons in this category shall equally be determined by national laws or regulations. article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all levels in particular in political trade union and civic matters which implies the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions for the protection of

union whereas the right of all persons to equality before the law and protection against discrimination constitutes a universal right recognised by the universal declaration of human rights the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women united nations covenants on civil and political rights and on economic social and cultural rights and by the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all member states are signatories convention no of the international labour organisation ilo prohibits discrimination in the field of employment and occupation it is important to respect such fundamental rights and freedoms this directive does not prejudice freedom of association including the right to establish unions with others and to join unions to defend one s interests the european union in its declaration no on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations annexed to the final act of the amsterdam treaty has explicitly recognised that it respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the member states and that it equally respects the status of philosophical and non-confessional organisations with this in view member states may maintain or lay down specific provisions on genuine legitimate and justified occupational requirements which might be required for carrying out an occupational activity has adopted this directive article occupational requirements member states may provide that a difference of treatment which is based on religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate member states may maintain national legislation in force or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of this directive pursuant to which in the case of occupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief a difference of treatment based on a person s religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out a person s religion or belief constitute a genuine legitimate and justified occupational requirement having regard to the organisation s ethos provided that its provisions are otherwise complied with this directive shall thus not prejudice the right of churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief acting in conformity with national constitutions and laws to require individuals working for them to act in good faith and with loyalty to the organisation s ethos. in the practice of european states relations between churches and the state are governed by a variety of constitutional models in the majority of the council of europe s member states the law itself does not define the nature of the legal relationship between a religious community and its clergy the religious community may conclude an employment contract with its ministers but is not under any obligation to do so and in most cases does not however even where there is no employment contract members of the clergy are often entitled to welfare benefits under the same conditions as other beneficiaries of the social-security system in a minority of states the relationship is governed by the applicable labour law although members of the clergy are required to observe a heightened duty of loyalty towards the religious community that employs them lastly in other states the domestic courts determine on the basis of the individual circumstances whether or not the employment relationship can be classified as contractual with regard to the trade-union rights of members of the clergy no states formally ban them from setting up trade unions and in some states they are even expressly afforded this right it should also be noted that for instance in austria bulgaria finland turkey france the united kingdom ireland and the netherlands there are trade unions for ministers of religion or associations that defend interests closely resembling those defended by workers trade unions,case originated application romania lodged court article

the case originated in an application no against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by ten russian nationals mr vasiliy anatolyevich berladir mr aleksandr edmundovich guryanov ms viktoriya borisovna ignatyeva mr yuriy borisovich lyakhov mr pavel anatolyevich marchenko mr oleg petrovich orlov mr andrey zbignevich rachinskiy mr yan zbignevich rachinskiy ms yelena zusyevna ryabinina and mr serguey yuriyevich trifonov the applicants on august the applicants were represented by lawyers of the ehrac-memorial moscow office the russian government the government were represented by mr g. matyushkin representative of the at the european court of human rights on june the court decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the applicants were born in and respectively they live in in november the city administration authorised a public gathering called the right march by a number of nongovernmental organisations such as the movement against illegal immigration and the eurasian youth movement the declared aim of the event was to commemorate the liberation of moscow from occupation and to express the participants dissatisfaction with the flow of immigration into this public event included a parade from the chistiye prudy underground station down to where a demonstration was held the event lasted for some two and a half hours and attracted several thousand people according to the applicants reportedly a number of participants shouted russia for russians for moscovites and displayed banners with slogans such as let s clean the unwelcome guests out of the city chechens the war is over it s time to go home or belongs to us following the above event a steering committee for an anti-fascist march was formed which included representatives of various human rights organisations it was decided to hold a public gathering on november to mark their opposition to the values proclaimed by the right march the event was planned to progress through several streets in central moscow to near the mayor s office where they would hold a demonstration on november the city administration stated that they would give permission only for the demonstration the administration also wanted it to be held in a different place and for one hour instead of two the organisers did not challenge in court the conditions imposed by the mayor s office instead they preferred to withdraw their application to hold the march as planned apparently considering that the modified conditions would work against the aims they sought to achieve by holding a public gathering instead the organisers opted to picket on the same date november from p.m. to p.m. next to the dolgorukiy monument they expected that up to fifty people would join the picket пикетирование there they intended to express their disagreement with the mayor s office as to the location of the previously planned march and demonstration it does not appear that this new event was meant any longer to be a direct reply to the right march on november thirteen persons including one of the applicants mr orlov gave notice of the event this time to the district authority in order to comply with the public gatherings act see relevant domestic law and practice cited in paragraph below in a letter of november referring to the security of the participants and the need to avoid causing obstruction to pedestrians and vehicles the district authority suggested that this new event also be held in tverskaya zastava square instead of tverskaya square from p.m. to p.m it was explained that under a order the area around the dolgorukiy monument was restricted to service vehicles of the mayor s office the organisers of the new event sent a letter expressing their disagreement with the authorities decision on the same day they informed the mayor s office that they were no longer intending to hold a march and a demonstration as initially planned in view of the mayor s reply of november prior to the date of the event the organisers did not challenge in court the conditions imposed on the event by the district authority see however the court decisions of march and october below instead despite the position of the district authority the organisers decided to hold a public gathering in on november at p.m the special security squad proceeded to arrest some participants allegedly without giving them time or opportunity to disperse after a verbal order to do so the applicants with fifty other people were taken to the tverskoy police station and remained there until p.m. while various records including administrative offence records were compiled on and november the justice of the peace delivered judgments finding the applicants guilty of a breach of the procedures for public gatherings article of the code of administrative offences they were ordered to pay a fine of russian roubles rub except for the ninth applicant who had to pay rub the justice of the peace referred to the district authority s letter of november concluding that the public gathering was unlawful the court held as follows in respect of the first applicant under the public gatherings act a picket means an expression by one person or several people of his or their opinion in public by way of displaying posters banners and other means of visual propaganda albeit without movement or use of sound-amplifying technical means it follows from the act that a right to hold public gatherings entails a corresponding duty of the public authorities it should be noted that representatives of the relevant public authorities should be appointed to ensure the lawfulness of the event public safety and public security thus to enable the event participants and the public officers to fulfil their obligations and duties there should be rules laid down for the event it follows from the material available that despite the orders of the police the event participants refused to stop the picket and thus committed a premeditated administrative offence it has not been established that the applicant acted as one of the event organisers however his actions disclosed a violation of the procedures for public gatherings because he did participate in a picket in a venue which had not been assigned for this purpose at the same time the court notes that he intended to take part in a public event and to express his opinion in relation to issues of general and political interest he should also have observed the rules laid down for the event however failing to respect the circumstances which were significant for the event and the police orders he refused to stop the picket. the court made similar findings in respect of other applicants except for mr orlov the court added in respect of mr orlov as follows the circumstances of the case and mr orlov s actions disclosed a violation of the procedure for a picket because no proper notification had been made to the competent public authority in relation to the picket the applicants appealed by separate appeal decisions taken between february and april the tverskoy district court of moscow upheld the decisions taken by the justice of the peace in separate proceedings mr orlov and another person sought to challenge the position taken by the district authority in its letter of november in a judgment of march the taganskiy district court of moscow cited the relevant legislative provisions and concluded that the circumstances of the case did not disclose any violation of those provisions on october the moscow city court endorsed the above conclusion on appeal under article of the russian constitution citizens have a right of peaceful assembly this right can be limited by a federal statute in so far as it is necessary to protect the constitutional regime morals health or rights or interests of others article of the constitution under sections and of the public gatherings act in force at the relevant time the organiser of a public event except for an event involving one person was to inform the competent authority of the event at least ten days in advance at least three days in advance for a picket пикетирование the organiser was required to indicate the purpose of the event its form the venue and the itinerary as well as the date timing and approximate number of participants the competent authority was to notify the organiser if it had a reasoned proposal for another venue and/or timing for the event the organiser was required to inform the competent authority whether he or she refused or accepted the suggested new venue and/or timing the event could not take place if the event organiser and authority had not approved the alternative proposal section a public event could be stopped if i there was a real threat to life or physical integrity of persons or property ii the event participants had acted unlawfully or if the event organiser had knowingly breached the requirements of the act as regards the conduct of the event section in such circumstances the representative of the public authority who should be present at the event could order the event organiser to put an end to the event this representative should also explain the reasons for such order and should provide time for compliance with the above order if the organiser had not complied the public official could issue the same order to the participants if both failed to comply the police was to take the appropriate measures to stop the event section a public event could not be held in zones

the case originated in an application no against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by fourteen russian nationals who live in voronezh or the voronezh region the applicants see the appended list on may the applicants were represented by ms olga anatolyevna gnezdilova a lawyer practising in voronezh the russian government the government were represented by mr g. matyushkin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights and then by his successor in that office mr m. galperin the applicants alleged in particular that their right to freedom of peaceful assembly had been violated and that some of them had been the victims of excessive use of force by the police on august the application was communicated to the government the applicants either owned businesses at voronezh municipal market and rented the market pitches for their businesses or worked as vendors for these businesses it appears that in august the title to the plot of land on which the market was located was transferred from the town to a municipal enterprise and then to a private company which intended to demolish the market and build a shopping centre it appears that in and court proceedings were ongoing between the prosecutor s office and the municipal enterprise in relation to the land in question disagreeing with this course of action which would adversely affect their businesses and employment the applicants and some other people several dozen in total decided to remain on the market premises permanently doing night shifts according to the applicants on an unspecified date and in a specified manner the entrepreneurs notified the town administration of their intention to constantly do night shifts at the market until the matters relating to the legality of the land s transfer and the demolition of the market were settled they started their night shifts on an unspecified date on august the police told the entrepreneurs who had gathered at the market to leave the premises some refused to comply in the absence of any court order and argued that under their rent contracts they had a right to remain at the market on august some of the applicants mr annenkov mr khripunov mr khavantsev mr finskiy ms suprunova ms zakharova and ms guseva were arrested see also paragraphs below these applicants were accused of an offence under article of the federal code of administrative offences the cao which punished disobeying or resisting the lawful order of a public official see paragraph below the applicants who were assisted by counsel before the trial court pleaded not guilty and denied that they had disobeyed or resisted any specific lawful orders from the police or that they had otherwise breached the public order or endangered public safety by a judgment of august a justice of peace convicted mr finskiy of the offence and sentenced him to five days administrative detention the court held as follows the defendant violated the procedure for organising and managing a gathering собрание he disobeyed a lawful order issued by police officers in relation to their duties to ensure public order and safety he also obstructed their exercise of the above duties the defendant s guilt is confirmed by the following documents the record of the administrative offence a complaint and written statements issued by the market director written reports by police officers and statements from witnesses on the same day mr khripunov was sentenced to five days detention the court held as follows the defendant violated the procedure for organising and managing a gathering he disobeyed a lawful order issued by police officers in relation to their duties to ensure public order and safety he also obstructed their exercise of the above duties a witness made the following statement before this court ‘ on august a group of entrepreneurs were doing night shifts to prevent the demolition of the market building suddenly police officers arrived and started to grab people and take them to the police station the defendant was also grabbed by the police he did not show any resistance during this procedure the court adopts a critical stance in relation to the testimony of this witness who is the defendant s acquaintance and colleague because this testimony is refuted by the bulk of the other evidence namely the officers written reports made in their official capacity a judgment apparently in similar terms was issued in respect of mr khavantsev who was sentenced to ten days detention as required under the cao the applicants started to serve their sentences of administrative detention immediately following the trial judgments in their cases at the same time the applicants appealed to the sovetskiy district court of voronezh hereafter the district court mr khripunov argued that the trial court had not made a proper assessment of the testimonies of eyewitnesses he and mr finskiy argued inter alia that they had taken part in a gathering and the public events act did not require that prior notice be given to the competent public authority for this type of public event see paragraph below moreover in breach of the act no written requirement to cease any unlawful conduct had been issued to them or the other entrepreneurs and the penalty of administrative detention had been disproportionate mr finskiy argued before the appeal court that he had been present on the market premises in the early morning of august because he had been performing a duty having heard some noise he had gone out of the building and had seen other entrepreneurs being arrested he had started to film the events on his camera but had then been ordered to delete the video and had been arrested the appeal court examined a written statement from m. the new executive director of the market he had arrived at the marketplace but could not get into the office building because a number of entrepreneurs were blocking the entrance by holding hands or linking their arms following a request by him for assistance the police had ordered the entrepreneurs to stop their activity the entrepreneurs including mr finskiy had not complied with that order the appeal court also examined written statements from b. ma and l. who provided testimony in the following terms while passing through the marketplace on the morning of august they had seen a group of some fifty people these people had been shouting slogans and calling for people in the town and regional administrations to be dismissed as well as calling for the violation of public order the police had told them to stop but they had not complied with that order thereafter the police had repeated the warning to the most active participant after he had failed to comply he had been taken to a police car while grabbing the officers uniforms and trying to run away officers s. y. and f. submitted written reports in the following terms on august noting the blocking of the entrance to the office building they had ordered the people present to disperse the same thing had happened on august approaching one of the most active participants mr finskiy they had ordered him to stop after he had refused they had taken him to the police station the appeal court heard ms d. who stated that mr finskiy had been trying to film the ongoing events when the police had taken him away he had not shown any resistance on august the district court upheld the judgment in respect of mr finskiy stating as follows the court has no reason to doubt the testimonies of police officers and l. b. and ma. because they were not previously acquainted with the defendant or other entrepreneurs and have no reason to give false testimony against him the court dismisses the argument that l. b. and ma could not be eyewitnesses since the market was surrounded by a wall their testimonies indicate that they effectively passed through the marketplace the court dismisses the argument that the police acted unlawfully in relation to the entrepreneurs presence at a gathering requiring no prior authorisation as the material in the file and testimonies indicate the police acted lawfully with the aim of ensuring public order and public safety because the entrepreneurs were blocking access to the market for employees and had not reacted to lawful orders from the police to stop these actions the court adopts a critical attitude in respect of the testimony of d. who tried to help her colleague avoid responsibility for the offence because this testimony is refuted by the other evidence by a decision of august in respect of mr khripunov the district court held p. a witness stated before the appeal court ‘ on august people in plain clothes and the police arrived at the market and following orders from the chief officer of the sovetskiy police station started to arrest entrepreneurs without explaining the reasons for such arrests the defendant was also arrested while showing no resistance or disobedience to any specific orders the fact that the defendant committed the offence is confirmed by the record of the administrative offence stating ‘ after his violation of the procedure for organising and managing public events while being arrested he disobeyed the lawful order of a police officer grabbed his uniform and tried to escape written statements from three passers-by who while passing through the market area saw some fifty people chanting slogans and calling for the dismissal of the mayor and the governor and for violations of the public order despite the police s order to stop what they were doing the entrepreneurs refused thereafter the police approached the defendant who appeared particularly active and again ordered him to stop what he was doing but he did not respond to this order while being placed in the police car he resisted and threated the officers with violence and prosecution the officers written statements in similar terms having approached one of the most active men subsequently identified as the defendant they warned him against committing offences but he did not react and refused to stop finskiy sic was thus arrested and taken to the police station the court dismisses the defence s argument that the defendant lawfully participated in a gathering requiring no prior authorisation because the police s actions were lawful and aimed to secure public order and public safety since the entrepreneurs were blocking the market employees access to the building the court adopts a critical attitude in respect of the testimony of p. who is the defendant s colleague and wants to help him because this testimony is refuted by the bulk of the other evidence. an appeal decision in similar terms was issued in respect of mr khavantsev thereafter learning in late september that the court decisions in respect of certain other participants in the same events had been quashed on appeal in september see paragraph below on october mr finskiy mr khavantsev and mr khripunov lodged applications under article of the cao for review of the final judgments in respect of them on november the deputy president of the voronezh regional court upheld the lower courts decisions in respect of each defendant the reviewing judge stated as follows i dismiss the defence s argument that the lower courts judges omitted to specify the type of public event in which the defendant had participated the relevant regulations on such public events and the specific details concerning the police s orders to the defendant it was established by the justice of the peace that the impugned event was a ‘ gathering by judgments of august the female defendants in the proceedings and mr annenkov were fined on and september the district court set aside the judgments in respect of the female defendants and mr annenkov as regards mr annenkov the appeal court held as follows neither the record of the administrative offence nor the judgment contains references to specific circumstances or actions relating to the corpus delicti of the imputed offence disobeying the lawful order of a police officer in particular neither of the two documents specifies what order was given to the defendant which was then not complied with moreover the judgment does not indicate that the defendant did disobey a lawful order issued by a police officer. in respect of ms guseva the appeal court held as follows it is indicated in the record of the administrative offence that the defendant violated the procedure relating to the organisation and management of demonstrations meetings and gatherings and that during her arrest she disobeyed the lawful order of a police officer in relation to his work to ensure public order the record does not specify what type of public event was being held which above-mentioned procedure was violated or what orders relating to maintaining public order during a public event were not complied with by the defendant. in respect of ms suprunova the appeal court held as follows the record of the administrative offence indicates that on august the defendant violated the procedure relating to the organisation and management of demonstrations meetings and gatherings and that during her arrest she resisted the lawful order of a police officer and grabbed his uniform and tried to escape the record does not indicate what type of public event was being held which applicable procedure the defendant allegedly violated what orders relating to maintaining public order during such an event were issued to the defendant by the police or which of those orders was not complied with. in respect of ms zakharova the appeal court held as follows neither the record of the administrative offence nor the first-instance judgment refers to specific facts and actions forming part of the offence imputed to the defendant namely disobeying the lawful order of a police officer or the specific order given to her which she failed to comply with moreover it does not follow that what the defendant disobeyed was a lawful order given by a police officer the record does not specify what the defendant s violation of the procedure concerning the organisation and management of demonstrations meetings and gatherings was or what type of event was being held. the appeal court ordered the return of the case files to the relevant justice of the peace thereafter the justice of the peace returned the files to the police station apparently for the documents to be amended or the administrative-offence records to be redrafted the files were not resubmitted for a retrial at a.m. on august the police arrested some twenty people at the market including certain applicants such as mr buzov ms garkavets ms zuravleva ms khavantseva and ms suprunova on august a justice of the peace examined a case against mr buzov the court heard ms khr. who stated that a group of people had impeded security guards as they tried to re-establish access to the market building the police had then arrived and had taken some people to the police station it appears that during the hearing the applicant who was assisted by counsel first sought to have some other witnesses and police officers examined in open court however according to the government he then withdrew his application by a judgment of august mr buzov was convicted of an offence under article of the cao and was sentenced to ten days administrative detention the justice of the peace found as follows the defendant disobeyed the police officers and did not comply with lawful orders to stop violating public order the defendant s guilt is confirmed by the administrative-offence record the police officers reports and the written testimonies of witnesses according to the government mr buzov did not serve his sentence as he was taken to the cardiology unit of a local hospital on the evening of august mr buzov appealed to the district court which held a hearing on august it heard his lawyer and ms yef. who stated that she had seen the applicant making a video recording while he was surrounded by security guards who had torn his clothes colleagues had managed to get him of the security guards grasp then the police had arrived and had started to push certain entrepreneurs aside one of the security guards had given an order to arrest mr buzov mr buzov had not disobeyed any orders and had not resisted arrest see also paragraph below by a decision of august the appeal court upheld the judgment of august in respect of the applicant learning in late september that the court decisions in respect of certain other participants in the events on august and august had been quashed on appeal see paragraphs above and paragraphs below the applicant and his counsel ms gnezdilova thought that they had a reasonable prospect of success in seeking a further review of the court decisions of and august in early october they lodged an application for review of those court decisions they argued inter alia that the lower courts had not specified what specific order the applicant had disobeyed or whether such an order was lawful under russian law the courts had not heard any officers or eyewitnesses who had witnessed the impugned reprehensible conduct on the part of the applicant and the courts had not specified any particular actions on his part which constituted a breach of public order on november the deputy president of the voronezh regional court upheld the lower courts decisions the judge held as follows the applicant was part of the group of people who impeded market officials as they tried to gain access to their office building the guards from a private security company intervened and a fight ensued between them and some participants these participants did not respond to orders from police officers the officers required the applicant who was one of the most active participants to cease his unlawful conduct but he did not respond to this order thereafter he was taken to the police station. on august a justice of the peace sentenced several female defendants to a fine however on september the district court heard appeals from them and set aside the judgments against them in respect of ms zhuravleva it held as follows article of the cao requires that a record of an administrative offence must describe among other things the factual elements relating to the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed the record concerning the defendant specifies that she disobeyed the police officers did not respond to their lawful requests to stop unlawfully violating the public order and grabbed the officers uniforms while being escorted to the police vehicle trying to push them away and run away the record of the administrative offence does not specify which requests relating to public order were addressed to the defendant and were not complied with or which actions of the applicant such requests related to the deficiencies of the record make it impossible to establish the defendant s liability for an administrative offence and the record must be returned to the police in respect of ms khavantseva and ms garkavets the appeal court held as follows neither the record of the administrative offence nor the justice of the peace s judgment specifies how the defendant violated public order or which specific order was given by the police in this connection but not complied with by her. it appears that the files were then returned to the police for the documents to be amended the files were not resubmitted to the relevant justice of the peace for a retrial on august mr annenkov s wife ms shatalova also an applicant in the present case lodged a criminal complaint with the sovetskiy investigations unit ms shatalova alleged that officer ku. a senior officer at the sovetskiy police station had subjected her elderly husband to ill-treatment on august she sought the institution of criminal proceedings against this officer she stated as follows at her request her husband had arrived at the market in the early morning of august where she had been doing night shifts with others in order to bring her some warm clothes officer ku had struck a blow to his chest causing the man to fall to the ground and sustain a head injury as he hit his head against the corner of a table mr annenkov was examined on august by a neurosurgeon a traumatology specialist and a therapist who concluded that he had a contused wound on his head measuring cm by cm by cm some swelling on his upper right arm and some other injuries this part of the certificate is not legible in her submissions before the court the applicant s lawyer alleged that mr annenkov had sustained a rib fracture she maintained this assertion following communication of the case to the government the latter did not comment on this matter unspecified officials carried out an inquiry between and august looking into whether any police officers had committed the offence of abuse of power defined at the time as actions manifestly outside the scope of official duties causing a significant violation of one s rights or legitimate interests an offence under article of the criminal code three other applicants ms guseva ms suprunova and ms zakharova also sought medical assistance on august ms suprunova was diagnosed with concussion and soft-tissue bruises on her head and right arm ms zakharova was diagnosed with soft-tissue bruises on her head and right shoulder ms guseva was examined by a forensic expert who concluded that she had bruises on the front upper part of her right arm measuring cm by cm and cm by cm and a smaller one on the inner part of her right arm abrasions on her right and left hip measuring cm by cm and cm by cm respectively and abrasions on her right and left ankle joints measuring cm by cm and cm by cm respectively it appears that on an unspecified date ms suprunova ms zakharova and ms guseva were heard in the context of the pre-investigation inquiry regarding mr annenkov ms zakharova stated that she had arrived at the market early on the morning of august and had seen a police officer dragging ms guseva she had protested to officer ku. who had then pushed her she had fallen to the ground hitting her shoulder and the back of her head against wooden objects on the ground ms suprunova stated that officer ku had ordered take this one and had started to pull her hair and hands but other entrepreneurs had tried to shield her ms guseva stated that she had tried to shield ms suprunova from officer ku. who was pulling her hair officer ku and officer kh had pushed ms guseva against a wall causing her to fall to the ground and lose consciousness she had then been dragged along the ground by her hands and had been kicked in the back by one of the officers as she was placed in the police car ms yef. the applicants colleague made a written statement that in the early morning of august some thirty people had been at the market upon being alerted to the arrival of the police she had gone out and seen some sixteen police officers including officer ku. a senior officer who was giving orders and indicating that the officers should take this one or something similar she had seen an officer twisting ms suprunova s arms and ms guseva being dragged along the ground then she had seen mr annenkov ask officer ku what are you doing and officer ku had suddenly hit him in the chest causing mr annenkov to fall to the ground and hit against the top of a table mr annenkov had fainted officer ku had then kicked him on the leg and ordered take this one officer ku made the following written statement during the inquiry on august the police station received information that in the early morning of august a group of three hundred people might take violent action in order to take possession of the market at a.m. some thirty officers under my supervision arrived at the market to prevent disorder and unlawful actions we saw some twenty people outside the building who were holding a meeting chanting slogans and shouting about the regional prosecutor and the governor the entrepreneurs had previously been issued with warnings against unlawful actions on their part suddenly some five women started to shout and call for help grabbing our uniforms we arrested some thirteen people including the most active perpetrators all of them resisted during the arrest we did use physical force against some people namely sambo fighting techniques such as twisting hands behind backs none of the officers including myself inflicted any blows on august an investigator issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings referring to the statements of several officers including officer ku. and the testimonies of mr annenkov ms shatalova ms zakharova and ms suprunova it appears that the refusal of august was then overruled for unspecified reasons and the inquiry was resumed written statements were obtained from some other participants in the gathering officer kh was also heard and he confirmed officer ku. s earlier statement on september the investigator issued a new refusal to institute criminal proceedings against officer ku. officer kh or other officers having summarised the above testimonies he concluded as follows no sufficient and objective data could be gathered during the inquiry to show that any police officers had committed any criminal offence the grievances presented in the complaints are refuted by the testimonies from the officers injuries could have been sustained during the arrest procedure owing to the resistance displayed to the police officers such resistance later being confirmed by the prosecution for the administrative offences furthermore in view of the important and irremediable inconsistencies in various testimonies there is no possibility of drawing a truthful conclusion regarding the commission of a criminal offence by ku. kh or others for unspecified reasons a new refusal to prosecute was issued on october it was then overruled on october by the deputy director of the district investigations department he indicated that it was necessary to assess the available court decisions regarding administrative offences concerning the events on august identify and interview people who had been kept with the arrested people at the police station identify and interview all police officers who had been present at the station and had compiled administrative-offence files against the arrested entrepreneurs and identify and interview all the officers who had been on duty on that date and had been present at the market four applicants mr annenkov ms suprunova ms guseva and ms zakharova sought judicial review in respect of the refusal dated october they learnt at a hearing on october that the refusal had already been overruled the case was therefore discontinued a new refusal was issued on november on december the regional investigations department set aside the refusal of november because it contained an insufficient assessment of the factual circumstances no plausible explanation for the applicants injuries and no assessment of the legality of the police s actions being unaware of the above decision one of the applicants sought judicial review of the refusal to prosecute dated november on november the district court discontinued the proceedings because the supervising authority had overruled the impugned refusal decision according to the government a new refusal to prosecute was issued on june it was overruled on october by the district prosecutor s office thereafter a criminal case was opened under article of the criminal code apparently mr annenkov and ms suprunova at least were interviewed again by an investigator mr annenkov also had a formal confrontation procedure with an unspecified witness who had allegedly seen the applicant stumble and fall to the ground by himself on august at the material time article of the cao punished the following behaviour with a fine or administrative detention disobeying the lawful order of a police officer a military officer or a detention facility staff member in relation to the fulfilment of their official duties aimed at securing public order and public safety and resisting the fulfilment of such duties by these public officials pursuant to article of the cao the penalty of administrative detention can not be imposed for an administrative offence committed by a pregnant woman a woman with children a person below the age of majority a person with a category or category disability military personnel or individuals in some other categories in its decision no of june the constitutional court considered that the legislator was empowered to provide for different types of penalty depending on whether the same administrative offence was committed by a man or a woman the aim of such differentiation was to protect the health and social well-being of a woman who was a mother in any event the penalty of administrative detention could only be imposed by a court and only in exceptional circumstances when a less intrusive penalty such as a fine would not be appropriate in a case involving a male defendant a judge should take into consideration whether the defendant was the sole parent taking care of his child or children for a summary of the domestic law and practice in relation to the review of final judgments issued by courts of general jurisdiction under the cao prior to and after certain legislative changes in december and august see smadikov v. russia dec. no january and orlovskaya iskra v. russia no february the federal law on gatherings meetings demonstrations processions and pickets no of june the public events act provides that a public event is an open peaceful event accessible to all organised at the initiative of citizens of the russian federation political parties other public associations or religious associations the aims of a public event are to express or develop opinions freely and to voice demands on issues related to political economic social or cultural life in the country as well as issues related to foreign policy section of the public events act the public events act provides for the following types of public events a gathering собрание an assembly of citizens in a specially designated or arranged location for the purpose of the collective discussion of socially important issues a meeting митинг a mass assembly of citizens at a certain location with the aim of publicly expressing an opinion on topical mainly social or political issues a demonstration демонстрация an organised expression of public opinion by a group of citizens with the use while advancing of placards banners and other means of visual expression a march шествие a procession of citizens along a predetermined route with the aim of attracting attention to certain problems a picket пикетирование a form of public expression of opinion which does not involve movement or the use of loudspeaker equipment where one or more citizens with placards banners and other means of visual expression station themselves near the target object of the picket section an organiser of a public event except for a gathering and a picket which is held by one person must notify the competent authority section it appears that only a solo picket was not subject to the requirement of prior notification see for instance decisions nos and of the moscow city court dated november and december while certain courts considered that both a gathering and a solo picket were not subject to this requirement see for instance decision no of the samara regional court dated june the police act federal law no of april authorised police officers to use physical force including combat fighting techniques to stop crimes being committed apprehend offenders and overcome resistance to lawful orders if less intrusive means had not allowed the officers to fulfil their functions section of the act everyone was to comply with the lawful order of a police officer failure to comply with such an order or obstruction in relation to such an order would result in the person concerned incurring legal liability police officers could not be held responsible for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage or damage to health caused by the use of physical force if the damage was proportionate to the resistance of the person concerned section of the act when using physical force a police officer was required to i strive to limit any damage caused to the person concerned bearing in mind the nature and degree of the danger posed by the offence and the danger posed by the person concerned as well as his or her resistance ii ensure an injured person s access to medical assistance section of the act the use of force in the context of exceeding authority constituting abuse of power could entail legal liability ibid. a police officer could rely on the provisions of the criminal code relating to self-defence causing damage during the arrest of a person who had committed a crime and extreme necessity section of the act article of the criminal code reads as follows the harming of legally protected interests in a state of extreme necessity that is for the purpose of removing a direct danger to a person or his rights to the rights of other persons or to the legally protected interests of society or the state shall not be deemed to be a crime if this danger could not be removed by other means and if there was no exceeding the limits of extreme necessity the infliction of harm that clearly does not correspond to the nature and the degree of danger threatened nor to the circumstances under which the danger was removed when equal or more considerable harm was caused to the abovementioned interests than the harm averted shall be deemed to exceed extreme necessity such exceeding authority shall

the case of the swedish engine drivers union was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights hereinafter referred to as the commission the case originated in an application against the kingdom of sweden lodged with the commission by the swedish engine drivers union on july the commission 's request to which was attached the report provided for under article art of the convention was lodged with the registry of the court on october within the period of three months laid down by articles para and art art the request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration made by the recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the purpose of the commission 's request is to obtain a decision from the court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a failure on the part of the kingdom of sweden to comply with the obligations binding on it under articles and art art art of the convention the president of the court deemed it conducive to the proper administration of justice to constitute a single chamber to consider both the present case and the schmidt and dahlström case rule para on october the president of the court drew by lot in the presence of the registrar the names of five of the seven judges required to sit as members of the chamber mr. s. petrén the judge of swedish nationality and mr. g. balladore pallieri the president of the court being ex officio members under article art of the convention and rule para b of the rules of court respectively the five judges so selected were mr. h. mosler mr. e. rodenbourg mr. a. favre mr. g. wiarda and mr. p. o'donoghue article in fine of the convention and rule para art mr. favre died in november and mr. rodenbourg in october they were replaced by mr. j. cremona and mrs. h. pedersen substitute judges balladore pallieri assumed the office of president of the chamber in accordance with rule para the president of the chamber ascertained through the registrar the views of the agent of the swedish government hereinafter referred to as the government and of the delegates of the commission regarding the procedure to be followed by an order of october the president of the chamber decided that the government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on february and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the government 's memorial the government 's memorial was received at the registry on february and that of the delegates on march on april the government lodged a document with the registry after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission the president decided by an order of june that the oral hearings should open on september on september the court held a preparatory meeting to consider the oral stage of the procedure on this occasion the court compiled a list of questions which it sent to the persons appearing before it requesting them to supply the required information in the course of their addresses the oral hearings were held in public at the human rights building in on and september there appeared before the court for the government mr. o. bergqvist legal adviser at the ministry of labour advisers for the commission mr. j. e. s. fawcett principal delegate mr. j. custers delegate mr. f. schmidt professor at the and mr. k. norström who had represented the applicant before the commission assisting the delegates under rule para second sentence the court heard the addresses of mr. fawcett mr. schmidt and mr. norström for the commission and mr. danelius for the government as well as their replies to questions put by the court and one judge the commission produced a document during the oral hearings the swedish engine drivers union svenska lokmannaförbundet is a trade union founded in with its head office in it is open to the five to six thousand employees of the swedish state railways who are either crewmen or personnel from among whom crewmen are recruited its membership rose from some in to in then dropped to in september thus the applicant union comprises between to of the eligible railway personnel by far the majority of whom to belong to the railwaymen 's section of the state employees union statsanställdas förbund sf one of the three principal federations of employees the applicant union is an independent trade union it complains that the swedish national collective bargaining office statens avtalsverk hereinafter referred to as the office concluded collective agreements on terms of employment and conditions of work only with the said federations it maintains that this policy has led to stagnation and a drop in its own membership the government challenges these statements general background for more than a hundred years workers and employers in the private sector in have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the state certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in and by the following legislation i the collective agreements act lag om kollektivavtal ii the act lag om arbetsdomstol and iii the act on the right to organise and negotiate lag om förenings-och förhandlingsrätt the collective agreements act deals with collective labour agreements between employers or employers associations and trade unions it specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements for example the parties may not take strike or lock-out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them the labour court act contained rules governing the composition jurisdiction and procedure of the the was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of the act on the right to organise and negotiate it also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation and application of collective agreements but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue unions or non-union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable paragraph below were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts as the case might be the above-mentioned act guarantees two distinct rights to the parties on the labour market namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate the right to organise is defined in section of the act as the right of employers and employees to belong to an employers organisation or a trade union to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union without interference or pressure by the other party the act specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer as the case may be to refrain from becoming a member of or to resign from an association to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer as the case may be on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association the only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the act is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as interference in the affairs of the association the right to negotiate is defined in section of the act as the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general it imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations to attend meetings for negotiations and where necessary to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved this provision is applicable to all trade unions including the applicant union as the ruled in see paragraph below this does not mean that the negotiation must lead to the conclusion of an agreement even where the substantive terms are not in dispute prior to the state determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the state and the employees as from january the state officials act statstjänstemanalag has virtually assimilated state employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights strikes lock-outs etc the act made the collective agreement act the act and the act on the right to organise and negotiate applicable in the public sector furthermore the act provided for collective agreements to be concluded subject to certain exceptions between the office representing the state as employer and the organisations of state employees the ministry of finance has a nominee on the governing board of the office the legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the swedish trade union movement one factor that contributed much to its adoption was the conclusion in december of a basic agreement on negotiations procedure slottsbacksavtalet between the office and the four main organisations of state employees namely i the state employees union statsanställdas förbund abbreviated to sf and known prior to july as statstjänarkartellen ii the national federation of state employees statstjänstemännens riksförbund abbreviated to sr iii the swedish confederation of professional associations sveriges akademikers centralorganisation abbreviated to saco iv the civil servants section of the central organisation of salaried employees tjänstemännens centralorganisations statstjänstemannasektion abbreviated to tco-s according to the information at the disposal of the court these federations of which numbers ii and iii recently merged represent the large majority of employees more than out of the whose terms of employment are negotiated by the office about forty trade unions are affiliated to these organisations the few independent trade unions including the applicant represent only about state employees in all clause of the above-mentioned basic agreement provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees behalf by the main organisation concerned unless the office and the main organisation agree otherwise a note is appended stating that it is not thereby intended to depart from the earlier practice observed in regard to negotiations with a particular association as to any question which exclusively concerns that association one exception was made to this rule in the case of the association of physicians sveriges läkarförbund some other exceptions have been or are made from time to time for instance in april the state concluded a separate collective agreement with an independent union of forestry workers the government and the applicant union disagree about the circumstances surrounding the making of such exceptions the royal order of june relating to certain public collective agreements kk om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m includes the following provisions article collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the king-in-council or by parliament shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the king-in-council article an authority which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement certain forms of employees representation are confined to parties to a collective agreement thus the applicant union complains inter alia of being disqualified from representation on the central works council of the swedish state railways established by royal order of on the working hours council established by the king-in-council and on the works committees the applicant further complains that it can not appoint official trade union representatives under the act of may on the status of trade union representatives at the place of work lagen om facklig förtroendemans ställning på arbetsplatsen or safety inspectors under article of the workers protection act as amended on november lagen om ändring i arbetarskyddslagen the law described above at paragraphs to has in recent years undergone various changes thus trade union rights in both the public and private sectors have been embodied in the new swedish constitution which came into force on january in addition the act of may on the procedure for the settlement of labour disputes lag om rättegången i arbetsvister has replaced the act since july the new act has enabled any trade union whether a party to a collective agreement or not to bring before the any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of such an agreement facts of the particular case between july and december the terms of employment and conditions of work of state employees were governed by a collective agreement concluded by the office and the four federations the applicant was not affiliated to any of these federations but the collective agreement was made directly applicable to it by an accessory agreement which the office concluded with the applicant on september on july the applicant indicated that it wished to terminate the accessory agreement as from the end of and it asked for negotiations regarding a new agreement indicating certain general guidelines for the negotiations on november the applicant union submitted more detailed demands regarding the terms of employment of its members and again asked for negotiations which were to start at the same time as the negotiations with other comparable unions this request was repeated in february and march in february and march the office held exploratory meetings with the four federations and provided them with certain proposals regarding the terms of employment which were to apply to state employees in and following these meetings the office also held a meeting with the applicant on march on this occasion the office and the applicant union examined the demands formulated by the union in its letter of november the office also handed over the proposals which it had previously presented to the four federations these proposals concerned all state employees including engine drivers finally the office declared that it did not intend to conclude a collective agreement with the applicant for the years and nor even an accessory agreement such as that concluded in it stated however that it was prepared to continue discussing engine drivers terms of employment with the applicant union on march the applicant union asked the office to reconsider its refusal to conclude a separate agreement with the union but the office replied on april that it maintained its previous position according to the government the new attitude of the office which even after the reform had concluded accessory agreements with the applicant and other independent trade unions could be explained by the fact that in at the end of and in the trade union structures in the public sector were tending to disintegrate on april the applicant union proclaimed a strike and a blacklisting of jobs as from may after certain legal and other questions regarding the strike and the blacklisting of jobs had been discussed in writing and orally between the office and the applicant the office decided on may to proclaim a lock-out of members of the applicant union as from may the strike and the blacklisting became effective on may but were cancelled as from may consequently the lock-out did not become effective however in retaliation against the strike action the state refused to apply retroactively to the members of the applicant union a new agreement concluded with the federations on july this caused each member of the applicant union a loss of to swedish crowns proceedings brought in the name of one of the applicant 's members concerning this dispute ended on october by a judgment of the supreme court of sweden dismissing the applicant 's claim on june the office transmitted to the applicant a copy of the final proposal made in the course of its negotiations with the four federations at a meeting on july the applicant requested the office to conclude with it an agreement which apart from certain clauses would be identical with the agreement to be concluded with the four federations the office rejected this proposal on july the office concluded with the four federations a general collective agreement for the years and in principle the agreement applied to all state employees including engine drivers in accordance with article of the royal order relating to certain public collective agreements the application of this agreement was extended to the members of the applicant union at a meeting on october the latter submitted to the office its demands for the period beginning january the applicant union also raised the question of a separate agreement a further meeting was held on november at which the demands presented by the applicant on october were examined in detail by letters of january and february the applicant union reverted to the question of a separate agreement but the governing board of the office decided on february to maintain its refusal to conclude such an agreement with the union negotiations between the office and the applicant union took place at three further meetings on february march and april at these meetings the office and the applicant discussed the terms of employment of engine drivers and the office informed the union about proposals which had been presented during the negotiations between the office and the four federations on june the office concluded a general collective agreement with two of the four federations namely sf and tco-s this agreement regulated the terms of employment of state employees including engine drivers for the period under article of the royal order of this general agreement became applicable to the members of the applicant union as well as to the members of the other two federations on june the applicant union introduced proceedings against the state before the labour court seeking a declaration that the office was obliged to enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement with the applicant union and also to conclude such an agreement with the applicant union if the parties were in accord on the substantive issues the applicant union referred to sections and of the act on the right to organise and negotiate the union also invoked article of the swedish constitution then in force some general principles of swedish law and a number of international instruments including the european convention on human rights the dismissed the applicant 's claim in a lengthily reasoned judgment delivered on february the court held that section of the act neither debarred a party from declaring at the outset of negotiations that it would not conclude an agreement nor implied an obligation to conclude an agreement following negotiations the court added that section of the same act did not afford trade union organisations any protection in their own right the noted that the international instruments relied on could serve to clarify swedish law while they had not been incorporated into swedish law it must be assumed that swedish law intended to respect them nevertheless the court found that the submissions on this point in the instant case did not cause it to alter its judgment on the questions in dispute on several subsequent occasions the applicant union attempted unsuccessfully to secure the conclusion of a collective agreement its latest attempt was in march in its application lodged with the commission on july the applicant union alleged violation of articles and art art art of the convention the commission declared the application admissible on july in its report on may the commission expressed the unanimous opinion that the conduct of the office might in principle raise an issue under article art of the convention even if the office were fulfilling typical employer functions that the refusal by the respondent government to enter into collective agreements with the applicant did not violate article para art as such that the different treatment of the applicant and the federations with regard to the enjoyment of the freedom of association was reasonably and objectively justified and did not therefore contravene article read in conjunction with article art that article art had not been violated in the present case the report contains a separate concurring opinion shared by four other

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by an association established under french law parti nationaliste basque organisation régionale d iparralde the applicant party on april the applicant party was represented before the court by mr j. chalbaud mr i. quintana and mr a. carballo lawyers practising in the french government the government were represented by their agent mrs e. belliard director of legal affairs ministry of foreign affairs having regard to the observations submitted by the respondent government and those submitted in reply by the applicant party and to the opinion adopted by the european commission for democracy through law venice commission at its plenary session march cdl-ad produced at the court s request rule of the rules of court the chamber declared the application admissible by a decision of october the applicant party is established as an association registered on the basis of the associations act of july its name in basque is euzko alderdi jeltzalea iparraldeko erakundea basque nationalist party iparralde regional organisation and its registered office is in bayonne iparralde is the basque designation for part of south-western its constitution of august states that it is formed as a regional branch of the eaj-pnb in the provinces of laburdi labourd benafarroa lower navarre and zuberoa soule and adopts the national ideology of the eaj-pnb and the traditional principles and modus operandi of the eaj-pnb to the extent that they are compatible with the present constitution the eaj-pnv euzko alderdi jeltzalea partido nacionalista vasco the french abbreviation is eaj-pnb is a political party established under spanish law whose aim is to defend and promote basque nationalism the applicant party states that its activities are the same as those of any political party it devises political programmes puts forward candidates for elections and takes part in election campaigns in order to be able to receive funds in particular financial contributions from the eaj-pnv the applicant party formed a funding association in accordance with section of the political life financial transparency act of march on september it applied to the national commission on election campaign accounts and political funding commission nationale des comptes de campagnes et des financements politiques the ccfp under section of the same act for authorisation of the funding association on january the ccfp rejected the application giving the following reasons in its decision the ccfp has been asked to authorise the funding association for the parti nationaliste basque as that political organisation s funding association within the meaning of section of the act of march as amended it was noted in the commission s opinion published in the official gazette of november and was acknowledged by the applicant party s chairman in his letter of january that the party receives funds from the spanish basque nationalist party section of law no of march as amended by section of law no of january prohibits the funding of a political party by any foreign legal entity personne morale the parti nationaliste basque receives financial support from the spanish basque nationalist party whose official recognition under spanish law does not in any way remove its status as a foreign legal entity accordingly this unlawful source of funding which accounts for most of the resources of the parti nationaliste basque precludes the party from having a funding association authorised in accordance with the law on june the applicant party applied to the ccfp to reconsider its decision the application was refused on july in a decision worded as follows as to the alleged absence of a ban on the financing of a french political party by a foreign political party having compared the provisions of article l. of the elections code applicable to election campaigns and section of the act of january the applicant contends that section simply states that only a political party can fund another political party and that contrary to the position regarding election campaigns no provision of any statute or regulations expressly prohibits the funding of a political party by another political party established under the law of a foreign country this argument disregards the fifth subsection of section of the act of march as amended by the acts of january and january which provides ‘ no funding association or financial agent may receive direct or indirect contributions or material assistance from a foreign state or a foreign legal entity. pursuant to section of the act of march the intervention of a funding association or financial agent is compulsory for the receipt of funds it thus follows from these two provisions read together that a party can not receive funds from a political party that is a foreign legal entity as to the alleged infringement of the community principle of the free movement of capital and alleged incompatibility with developments in national electoral law these two principles conflict with express provisions of french law firstly the free movement of capital does not prevent local law from regulating certain aspects of this principle secondly the transnational representativeness of parties does not necessarily presuppose financial support from abroad and contrary to what the applicant argues the prohibition of such support does not in any way impair the full exercise of the right to vote and to stand for election on september the applicant party applied for judicial review of that decision to the conseil d etat which dismissed the application on december in a judgment worded as follows section of the political life financial transparency act law no of march in the wording resulting from law no of january provides that political parties and their territorial and specialist organisations ‘ collect funds through the intermediary of an agent duly designated by them which may be either a funding association or an individual section inserted into the act of march by the act of january provides that ‘ authorisation to act as a political party s funding association shall be given by the national commission on election campaign accounts and political funding it follows from the first subsection of section inserted into the act of march by the act of january that the granting of authorisation is subject to the funding association s compliance with the requirements of sections and of the act among the requirements concerned are those set forth in the penultimate subsection of section which provides ‘ no funding association or financial agent of a political party may receive direct or indirect contributions or material assistance from a foreign state or a foreign legal entity. substantive legality the applicant group argues that the commission erred in its application of section of the act of march and that should the commission s interpretation be held to prevail the statutory provisions cited in support of its decision should be struck down as being contrary to the constitution and incompatible with france s international obligations as to the alleged erroneous application of section of the act of march the penultimate subsection of section of the act of march prohibits funding associations from receiving financial contributions ‘ from a foreign state or a foreign legal entity foreign political parties which belong to the category of foreign legal entities fall within the purview of that prohibition the amendments resulting from the act of january to the second subsection of section with the effect firstly of prohibiting a legal entity from funding a party or a political group and secondly of excluding ‘ political parties and groups from this prohibition on account of the role conferred on them by article of the constitution of october had neither the purpose nor the effect of exempting foreign political parties from the prohibition on the funding of a french political party by any foreign legal entity consequently the applicant group has no basis for arguing that the impugned decision was based on an erroneous application of the provisions of the penultimate subsection of section of the act of march in conjunction with the second subsection of that section as to the alleged breach of article of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen it is not for the conseil d etat acting in its judicial capacity to assess whether the law is compatible with the constitution accordingly the argument that section of the act of march contravenes article of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen to which the preamble to the constitution refers fails as to the alleged incompatibility of the law with s international obligations as regards the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the applicant group relies on the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms article paragraph of which secures freedom of expression to everyone ‘ without interference by public authority and regardless of borders and article of which provides that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the convention is to be secured ‘ without discrimination on any ground such as national origin even accepting as the applicant group argues that the rules on the conditions for funding political parties have a bearing on the right to freedom of expression within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention which includes as well as the freedom to hold opinions ‘ the freedom to receive and impart information and ideas paragraph of the same article nonetheless provides that ‘ t he exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such ‘ restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society to the extent that they satisfy one or other of the requirements set forth in that paragraph among which is ‘ the prevention of disorder political groups and parties falling within the purview of article of the constitution of the are intended to contribute to the exercise of suffrage in the implementation of national sovereignty in prohibiting foreign states and foreign legal entities from funding national political parties the legislature sought to preclude the possibility of creating a relationship of dependency which would be detrimental to the expression of national sovereignty the aim thus pursued is linked to the ‘ prevention of disorder within the meaning of paragraph of article of the convention on account of both the justification of this measure and the fact that the right to freedom of expression is affected only indirectly by the rules governing the funding of political parties and in view of the margin of appreciation which article paragraph affords the national legislature the provisions of section of the act of march are not incompatible either with the requirements of article of the convention or indeed with those of article as regards community law the applicant group argues that since the resources obtained by the funding association whose authorisation has been refused stem from a political party with its registered office in a member state of the european community the provisions of the penultimate subsection of section of the act of march in so far as they apply to a situation governed by community law are incompatible with a number of provisions of the treaty establishing the european community thirdly even supposing that the rules governing the funding of political parties may in certain respects have a bearing on the free movement of capital between member states as guaranteed by article of the ec treaty that article as article clearly indicates does not affect the right of member states to ‘ take measures which are justified on grounds of public security regard being had both to the aim it pursues and to the limited impact it has on the free movement of capital the prohibition set forth in the penultimate subsection of section of the act of march is to be counted among the measures that may be taken by a member state under article of the treaty accordingly the submission that the act is incompatible with article must be dismissed fourthly the provisions of section of the act of march which as stated above are intended to avoid creating any relationship of dependency between political parties in the performance of their function and a foreign state or a foreign legal entity are likewise not incompatible with the provisions of article of the treaty which appear in a part of the treaty dealing with the community institutions and more specifically the european parliament and which read ‘ political parties at european level are important as a factor for integration within the union they contribute to forming a european awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the union. accordingly and even supposing that article creates any rights in respect of private individuals this submission must fail the first paragraph of article of the constitution of october provides political parties and groups shall contribute to the exercise of suffrage they shall be formed and carry on their activities freely they shall respect the principles of national sovereignty and democracy. section of the political life financial transparency act law no of march reaffirms that political parties and groups shall be formed and shall carry on their activities freely adding that they have legal personality and are entitled to take part in court proceedings and to acquire movable and immovable property by way of gift or for consideration and that they may perform any actions consistent with their purpose including establishing and running newspapers and training institutions in accordance with the statutory provisions in force the financing of politics in general and political parties in particular is governed by law main source technical files on the senate s website www.senat.fr in addition to the operating costs they have to meet in the same way as any other association political parties incur significant expenditure during election campaigns they have two main sources of funds private funding which is generally modest and state funding which nowadays accounts for a decisive share like any association political parties may charge membership fees in practice however these account for only a very small proportion of their resources the act of march as amended gives them the further possibility of receiving donations from individuals donations from other legal entities are in principle prohibited however voluntary contributions from individuals are traditionally modest the following provisions of the act of march as amended are relevant to the present case section political parties and the territorial or specialist organisations they may designate for this purpose shall collect funds through the intermediary of an agent duly designated by them which may be either a funding association or an individual. section authorisation of a political party s funding association shall be granted by the national commission on election campaign accounts and political funding referred to in article l. of the elections code provided that the sole object of the association is the funding of a political party and that its articles of association comply with the provisions of the following subsections of this section the authorisation shall be published in the official gazette the articles of an association authorised to act as a political party s funding association must include the delimitation of the geographical area within which the association is to carry on its activities and an undertaking to open a single bank or post-office account into which all donations received for the funding of a political party are to be deposited. section the political party shall declare in writing to the prefecture of the département in which its registered office is situated the name of the individual it has chosen as its financial agent the declaration must be accompanied by the express consent of the person designated and must specify the geographical area within which the financial agent is to perform his or her duties the financial agent must open a single bank or post-office account into which all donations received for the funding of the political party are to be deposited. section donations made by duly identified individuals to one or more associations authorised as funding associations or to one or more financial agents of the same political party may not exceed euros per annum other legal entities with the exception of political parties or groups may not contribute to the funding of political parties or groups either by making donations in any form to their funding associations or financial agents or by providing them with property services or other direct or indirect benefits for less than the usual price the funding association or financial agent shall provide the donor with a receipt a decree issued after consultation of the conseil d etat shall lay down the conditions for drawing up and using such receipts this decree shall also determine the procedure whereby receipts issued for donations by individuals of amounts lower than or equal to euros shall not mention the name of the receiving party or group all donations of more than euros to a funding association or financial agent of a political party must be made by cheque no funding association or financial agent of a political party may receive direct or indirect contributions or material assistance from a foreign state or a foreign legal entity notices and documents issued by the funding association or financial agent to third parties for the purpose of soliciting donations must indicate as appropriate the name of the association and the date of its authorisation or the name of the agent and the date of the declaration to the prefecture and also the political party or group for which the sums collected are intended. section anyone who makes or accepts donations in breach of the provisions of the preceding section shall be liable to a fine of euros or one year s imprisonment or both. section the authorisation of any association that has failed to comply with the requirements laid down in sections and of this act shall be revoked in that event or where the summary statement mentioned in section is found not to have been transmitted the votes obtained in the geographical area of the association s activity by the political party or group which requested its authorisation shall be discounted for the following year from the total referred to in the first subsection of section above. section no political party or group which has obtained authorisation for a funding association or has appointed a financial agent may receive donations from duly identified persons other than through the intermediary of such association or agent in the event of a breach of this requirement the provisions of the last subsection of section shall apply. every year appropriations are set aside in the budget bill for political parties and groups one half is allocated according to their results in the last election to the national assembly and the other half according to their representation in parliament section of the act of march as amended the first portion of these subsidies is distributed among parties and groups which put forward candidates who each obtained at least of the votes cast in at least fifty constituencies in the most recent election to the national assembly or which put forward candidates solely in one or more overseas départements or in st pierre and miquelon mayotte new caledonia french polynesia or wallis and futuna who obtained at least of the votes cast in all constituencies in which they stood the second portion is distributed among parties and groups eligible for the first portion in proportion to the number of members of parliament belonging to or attached to them section of the act of march as amended state subsidies are now the main source of political parties funding euros eur was distributed among more than forty parties or groups in in addition the state grants parties resources which may be regarded as indirect funding outside election campaign periods political organisations represented by parliamentary groups in the national assembly or the senate are entitled to air time allowing them to broadcast on public radio stations and television channels they are also granted certain tax concessions reduced-rate corporation tax on some of their own income for example from leasing out their buildings and undeveloped land except in the case of the election of département councillors in cantons with fewer than inhabitants or municipal councillors in municipalities with fewer than inhabitants all candidates intending to receive donations for the organisation of their campaigns are required to do so through a financial agent who is the sole person entitled to collect funds to cover campaign costs and the payment of expenses except for those borne by a political party or group donations from individuals are capped at eur per candidate per campaign contributions from other legal entities with the exception of political parties and groups and from foreign states or foreign legal entities are prohibited articles l. and l. of the elections code election expenditure is subject to a ceiling according to the number of inhabitants in the constituency concerned article l. of the elections code the financial agent must keep campaign accounts recording all receipts and expenditure relating to the election campaign the accounts must be certified by an accountant and submitted to the scrutiny of the national commission on election campaign accounts and political funding which approves or rejects them if the accounts are approved the state reimburses candidates who obtain at least of the votes cast in the first round in the form of a lump sum of up to of the maximum permitted expenditure in the constituency in question within the limits of the amounts actually spent see in particular article l. of the elections code the state bears the costs associated with official election material defined as the cost of paper printing of ballot papers circulars posters and official billposting fees these costs are reimbursed on the basis of an official scale to candidates obtaining at least of the votes cast at its plenary meeting march the venice commission adopted guidelines on the financing of political parties document cdl-inf the relevant parts of which read the commission being engaged in the promotion of fundamental principles of democracy of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and in the context of improving democratic security for all noting with concern problems relating to the illicit financing of political parties recently uncovered in a number of council of europe member states taking into account the essential role of political parties within democracy and considering that freedom of association including that of political association is a fundamental freedom protected by the european convention on human rights and is one of the cornerstones of genuine democracy such as that envisaged by the statute of the council of europe paying particular attention to state practice in the area of financing of political parties recognising the need to further promote standards in this area on the basis of the values of european legal heritage has adopted the following guidelines for the purpose of these guidelines a political party is an association of persons one of the aims of which is to participate in the management of public affairs by the presentation of candidates to free and democratic elections such political parties may seek out and receive funds by means of public or private financing regular financing public financing public financing must be aimed at each party represented in parliament in order however to ensure the equality of opportunities for the different political forces public financing could also be extended to political bodies representing a significant section of the electoral body and presenting candidates for election the level of financing could be fixed by legislator on a periodic basis according to objective criteria tax exemptions can be granted for operations strictly connected to the parties political activity the financing of political parties through public funds should be on condition that the accounts of political parties shall be subject to control by specific public organs for example by a court of audit states shall promote a policy of financial transparency of political parties that benefit from public financing private financing political parties may receive private financial donations donations from foreign states or enterprises must however be prohibited this prohibition should not prevent financial donations from nationals living abroad other limitations may also be envisaged such may consist notably of the transparency of private financing of each party should be guaranteed in achieving this aim each party should make public each year the annual accounts of the previous year which should incorporate a list of all donations other than membership fees all donations exceeding an amount fixed by the legislator must be recorded and made public on may the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted recommendation on the financing of political parties the relevant parts of which read the assembly believes that the rules on financing political parties and on electoral campaigns must be based on the following principles a reasonable balance between public and private funding fair criteria for the distribution of state contributions to parties strict rules concerning private donations a threshold on parties expenditures linked to election campaigns complete transparency of accounts the establishment of an independent audit authority and meaningful sanctions for those who violate the rules accordingly the assembly considers that as regards sources of finance states should encourage citizens participation in the activities of political parties including their financial support to parties it should be accepted that membership fees traditional and non-controversial sources of finance are not sufficient to face the ever increasing expense of political competition political parties should receive financial contributions from the state budget in order to prevent dependence on private donors and to guarantee equality of chances between political parties state financial contributions should on the one hand be calculated in ratio to the political support which the parties enjoy evaluated on objective criteria such as the number of votes cast or the number of parliamentary seats won and on the other hand enable new parties to enter the political arena and to compete under fair conditions with the more well-established parties state support should not exceed the level strictly necessary to achieve the above objectives since excessive reliance on state funding can lead to the weakening of links between parties and their electorate besides their financial contributions states may contribute indirectly to financing political parties based on law for example by covering the costs of postage and of meeting rooms by supporting party media youth organisations and research institutes and also by granting tax incentives together with state funding private funding is an essential source of finance for political parties as private financing in particular donations creates opportunities for influence and corruption the following rules should apply in recommendation rec of april on common rules against corruption in the funding of political parties and electoral campaigns the committee of ministers of the council of europe recommended that the governments of member states specifically limit prohibit or otherwise regulate donations from foreign donors article,case originated application lodged court

observations which were received at the registry on june on august the secretary to the commission forwarded to the registrar certain comments from the applicant union on those observations on august the registrar communicated these comments to the government which informed him on september that it did not think it necessary to revert to the explanations it had earlier given to the court the facts of the case may be summarised as follows the applicant the national union of belgian police has its headquarters at brussels-schaerbeek the union descends from the belgian police federation founded in and changed its name in in it was constituted in the form of a non-profit-making association within the meaning of the act of june associations of this kind have capacity in civil law the applicant union is open to all members of the municipal police including rural policemen regardless of rank but members of the two state police forces the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities police judiciaire près les parquets and the gendarmerie may not at present belong to it it numbers police superintendents and deputy superintendents amongst its members the list of the applicant union s members deposited on july in accordance with law contained the names of persons this was not the whole of its membership but only the active members that is to say those who are delegated by the sections to represent them at the general meeting and are alone entitled to vote article of the applicant union s articles of association annexed to the moniteur belge of july the applicant union claims to have had paid-up members in and that their numbers fell to in in in and in it is alleged by the applicant union that this steep decline of some was due specially to the trade union consultation policy contested in the present case the government does not dispute the fact of the decline but does not attribute it to the cause put forward by the applicant there being about men serving in the municipal police whose establishment provides for at the end of the applicant union represented almost half of the members of the force the municipal police whose members are classified as municipal officials is entrusted both with functions of an administrative and crime-deterrent character as well as with criminal-police functions in carrying out its administrative and crime-deterrent duties the municipal police is directly subject to the municipal authorities and placed under the orders of the burgomasters on the other hand in the exercise of its criminal-police functions it is subject solely to the authority of the state and more especially the judicial authorities autorités judiciaires the two state police forces are distinct from the municipal police the gendarmerie itself also vested with both administrative police duties maintenance of order and criminal-police duties can in addition discharge military duties in certain circumstances and is organised on military lines the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities la police judiciaire près les parquets has for its part exclusively criminal-police de police judiciaire duties the municipal police force amounts to some of municipal staff and less than of all municipal and provincial staff at the end of municipal staff totalled officials to which number were added the staff of municipal social welfare boards inter-communal associations and provinces the gendarmerie and criminal police numbered respectively and members as of june under article of its articles of association the aim of the applicant union is any activity directly or indirectly relating to the study protection development improvement and progress of any matter concerning the rights and occupational interests of the belgian police particularly by means of trade union action freedom of association is recognised in by article of the constitution and is guaranteed in all fields by the act of may furthermore is a party to international labour organisation conventions no concerning freedom of association and protection of the right to organise act of july and no concerning the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively act of november these various provisions safeguard inter alia the right freely to form trade unions the right to join or not to join them the right of trade union members freely to elect trade union representatives and the right of trade unions freely to organise their administration while therefore in belgian law freedom is the rule for trade unions in matters of founding organising recruitment and propaganda the same is not true of consultation of trade unions by public authorities acting as employers in order to avoid having to negotiate with an ever increasing number of parties the public authorities have in fact fixed certain criteria for selection based on the idea of representativeness of trade unions they have also introduced this principle in several acts dealing with relations between employees and employers in the private sector for example the act of july on the health and safety of workers and the hygiene of places of work and working conditions the act of may setting up a national labour council and the act of december on collective labour agreements and joint committees apart from a decree of september referred to below paragraph the first regulation on trade union consultation in the public sector dates back to a royal decree of june applicable to state officials exclusively the royal decree confines consultation to organisations having a seat on a trade union advisory committee set up within each ministerial department and a seat in a general trade union advisory committee operating under the aegis of the prime minister these committees are consulted on all proposals concerning the status of state officials organisation of services and work safety health and improvement of places of work the representative character of these trade unions is assessed at two levels first at the level of the different ministerial departments and secondly at the level of the state administration as a whole the sole criterion for representativeness is the number of members determined by elections held in principle every four years in fact the last trade union elections were held in the elections due to be held in were postponed sine die at the request of the large trade union federations which had obtained a low percentage of votes in in the case of the criminal police attached to the prosecuting authorities the government has reserved the benefit of consultation for the organisations which are confined to members of this force royal decree of february the government states that in fact these organisations are in turn affiliated to the three large belgian trade union federations as regards the gendarmerie section para of the act of january provides that members of the gendarmerie may join only occupational associations composed solely of gendarmes the national staff union of the gendarmerie has been recognised as the sole organisation representing members of the corps there are no general regulations governing relations of municipal and provincial authorities with trade unions the municipal authorities are free to set up trade union consultation if they so wish some of them such as the towns of antwerp charleroi mons and verviers have done so and set up commitees generally organised like those which operate at national level on which sit delegates of certain representative trade union organisations otherwise there is no organised consultation but trade unions may as everywhere else in the country lodge claims or make representations on behalf of a member without any condition of representativeness the position proves to be very different as regards relations between the ministry of the interior which is the supervisory authority and the staff of municipalities and provinces after a first attempt a bill of had failed trade union consultation was introduced at this level by an act of july prior to that there had been no statutory provisions a decree issued by the regent on september had set up a trade union consultative committee at the ministry of the interior on this committee there were amongst others delegates of the union of national associations of civil servants and municipal officials including the secretary general of the applicant union but the government states that the commitee was of little importance and soon ceased to meet section of the act of july reads as follows the general arrangements to be made by the king shall be decreed after consulting representatives of those organisations that best represent the staff of the provinces and municipalities the forms of such consultation shall be determined by the king under the same section the representative organisations are to be consulted on the following subjects staffing recruitment and promotion conditions for municipal staff pecuniary status and salary scales for the staff of provinces and municipalities general rules governing certain allowances and bonuses rules governing the adjustment of pay scales and pecuniary status in line with the changes which have occurred since january in the pecuniary status of staff of the ministries conditions for appointment to the posts of police superintendent and deputy superintendent and criteria for up-grading consultation is important on two counts first the government is bound to ask for the opinion of the representative organisations and secondly in the course of consultation it informs the representative organisations of its proposals in order that they may make known their opinions before any decision is reached the consultation machinery is set in motion for the preparation of every rule-making instrument bill royal decree ministerial decree or circular which relates to the matters listed above royal decrees and ministerial circulars have been formulated in this way usually concerning the entire staff of provinces and municipalities but several of them containing measures peculiar to the municipal police and some valid only for that force if an organisation is not recognised as representative it is barred from the consultation procedure but may nonetheless inter alia submit claims to the supervisory authority ask to be heard by it refer cases to it and make representations on behalf of its members the modalities of consultation of trade unions recognised as representative were first fixed by a royal decree of october this decree set up a trade union consultation committee attached to the ministry of the interior on which the only trade union delegates were the representatives of the four large trade union federations listed in the following paragraph article the applicant union applied to the conseil d etat for a declaration of annulment of the decree however on the day of the hearing october the moniteur belge published a royal decree of october withdrawing the provision which was being challenged the case was then removed from the list of the conseil d etat a royal decree of august re-organised the trade union consultation in question while the consultation committee remained its membership was radically changed in respect of both the number and appointment of representatives the representatives were no longer to be appointed by specified trade unions but by the organisations most representative of the staff of the provinces and municipalities article para specified what was to be understood by most representative those organisations which are open to all staff of the provinces and municipalities and which protect such staff s occupational interests shall be deemed to be the organisations most representative thereof each such organisation shall make itself known by sending to the minister of the interior by registered post within forty days of publication of this decree in the moniteur belge a copy of its articles of association and a list of its officers the minister of the interior shall verify whether it complies with the conditions required and shall notify it of his decision four trade unions of which the first two have since merged were recognised as meeting these criteria the liberal union of civil servants the liberal public services union a member of the affiliated belgian trade unions the affiliated public services unions provincial and municipal sector a member of the belgian general federation of labour and the affiliated christian public services unions provincial and municipal sector a member of the christian trade unions it is difficult to specify the number of persons affiliated in these various organisations some of the applicant union s members are also affiliated to one or other of the large federations the government says that two of these federations have policemen as members at least two of the trade union organisations recognised as representative have technical committees for the municipal police which as occasion arises deal with problems particular to this force on september the applicant union asked the minister of the interior to consider it as one of the most representative organisations of staff of provinces and municipalities for the purposes of the implementation of the above-mentioned royal decree by letter of february the minister replied as follows from the documents you have submitted it does not appear that your organisation fulfils the required conditions namely that it should be open to all the staff of the provinces and municipalities and protect such staff s occupational interests prior to that on october the applicant union had applied to the conseil d etat for a declaration of annulment of the royal decree of august alleging that section of the act of july had been contravened the applicant contended that section which was drafted in very wide terms implied that the organisations grouping officials by category and without regard for their opinions should subject to their being the most representative organisations be consulted on an equal footing with the organisations in which officials joined together according to their political feelings and without distinction as to their occupations in the applicant s view the preparatory work to section showed that consultation should extend to every representative organisation which protected the occupational interests of staff governed by particular staff regulations claiming that three quarters of the men in the municipal police belonged to it and that the force had its own regulations and constituted a corps within the personnel of the municipalities the applicant thus maintained that it was representative in a twofold way the number of its members as compared with the number of municipal policemen and the special character of their functions in the submission of the applicant the king had acted ultra vires in stipulating that the condition representative must be confined to organisations open to the whole of provincial and municipal staff the applicant union did not refer to articles and art art of the convention nor to article of the belgian constitution it submitted however albeit in a subsidiary way that article para of the royal decree violated the principle of trade union freedom in that it made it obligatory for police officers to join political trade unions the minister of the interior submitted in reply that section para of the act of july provided explicitly for consultation of the organisations most representative of the staff of the provinces and municipalities the minister added that the conseil d etat in its opinion no l had taken the view that there was no objection to considering as the most representative organisations those which included staff members of all categories the minister inferred from this that the application was ill-founded the conseil d etat dismissed the application on november it held that while the criterion of number advanced by the applicant was acceptable when applied to workers in the private sector or even to civil servants and officials in large government departments belonging to the same hierarchical structure and subject to the same regulations it can not be accepted in the present case since the officers concerned belong to widely different categories which have no link between them some being governed by separate regulations it further considered that this diversity of categories and regulations has the effect of making the consultation of organisations representing staff much more difficult that in each category the persons concerned will tend to claim as many advantages as possible for themselves without paying any heed to the implications of measures on which they are consulted for the position of the other staff members whereas the authority has to take such implications into account that the consultation of the organisations by the government can not in most cases serve any useful purpose unless it concerns organisations which comprise staff belonging to all categories and which therefore have to strike some balance in their claims in order to protect the interests of all their members it found that in considering the organisations representing the occupational interests of all staff of the provinces and municipalities to be the organisations most representative of such staff the decree being challenged is not contrary to the intention of the statute that the applicant is in error in still maintaining that the contested provision is contrary to the principle of trade union freedom by making it obligatory for police officers to join political trade unions that in fact the contested provision does not oblige police officers to join any trade union nor any particular trade union the judgment ended with the conclusion that in the organisation of public services the king may confine the consultation of occupational organisations to whichever organisations are the most representative of the staff as a whole which procedure has repeatedly been given statutory confirmation translated from recueil des arrêts et avis du conseil d etat pp in the meantime a royal decree of august had abolished the committee provided for in the decree of august but preserved consultation of the most representative organisations as provided in article para of the decree since then such consultation takes place in writing an act of december re-organised the relations between public authorities and trade unions of officials in the service of those authorities section i of this act provides that the system which the act establishes may be made applicable by the king with certain exceptions one of which concerns the members of the armed forces not only to the staff of the administration and other government departments particularly of the services which assist the judicial authorities pouvoir judiciaire but also to the staff of the provinces and municipalities including the municipal police the act establishes a procedure of negotiation chapter ii and a procedure of consultation chapter iii for negotiation the act provides that the king shall establish three general committees namely the committee for the national public services the committee for provincial and local public services and the joint committee for all public services section as well as special committees among which will be committees competent for questions relating to the staff of provincial or municipal services section the king shall determine the composition and operation of these committees section on which only representative organisations shall sit from the trade union side section section defines in detail the criteria of representativeness for each of the three general committees section for the special committees consultation shall take place within consultation committees set up by the king for services and groups of services comprising not less than twenty-five officials section section provides that the trade union organisations represented on a special negotiating committee shall be entitled to appoint delegates to sit on the consultation committees set up within the competence of that committee there will be negotiations on the basic regulations concerning staff administration matters pecuniary status pension schemes relations with trade union organisations and the organisation of the social services on regulations internal measures or directives of a general nature relating to the subsequent fixing of staff structures to working hours or to the organisation of work lastly on bills concerning any of these various matters section there will be consultation for decisions determining the staff structure of the services covered by the consultation committee in question regulations which the king has not specified as basic regulations etc section in its observations of february the applicant union expressed the opinion that the present case would probably become pointless if the act of december became applicable to municipal officials at hearings of and may the government stressed that the application of the act to provincial and municipal staff would not be an easy matter and would require more time the government consider that it may in any case be inferred from the text and the preparatory work of the act that even when it becomes applicable to such staff it will not change the trade union status in a way favourable to category-based unions in its view the applicant union will not be entitled to sit on a general or special negotiating committee the applicant accordingly now feels that it is doubtful wether the new law will give just satisfaction to the union and has so informed the court through the commission in its application lodged with the commission on march the national union of belgian police alleged violation of articles and of the convention in conjunction with article art art in that the belgian authorities refused to recognise it as a representative organisation thus debarring it from the consultation provided for by the act of july the union also claimed damages which it provisionally assessed at belgian francs the commission declared the application admissible by a final decision of february after having rejected on may certain of the preliminary objections made by the respondent government during the examination of the merits the applicant union confined itself to relying on article art both on its own and in conjunction with article art in its report of may the commission expressed the opinion unanimously that the state whether acting as legislator or employer assumes obligations within the scope of article para art of the convention by eight votes to five that the right to consultation and more generally freedom to bargain collectively are important and even essential elements of trade union action falling within the scope of article para art by eight votes to five that this right to consultation is not however unlimited the limit being in the case of the applicant union the existence of an objective criterion for representativeness unanimously that the regulations at issue on trade union consultation in do not constitute a breach of article para art of the convention unanimously that the difference in treatment introduced by belgian legislation between different categories of unions is justified in the circumstances of the case and is consistent with articles and art of the convention taken together the report contains a separate concurring opinion to which four other members of the commission subscribed the government made the following final submissions at the oral hearing on may in the afternoon may it please the court in the first place article art does not apply in the present case and there is therefore no reason to consider whether there has been violation of article taken in conjunction with article art

pilsētas domes un pagasta padomes vēlēšanu likums contains similar provisions to the provisions of the parliamentary elections act cited above in particular section is identical to section of that act

procedure civilprocesa kodekss which was inserted by a law of september and is entitled examination of cases concerning the attestation of restrictions on electoral rights the provisions of that chapter read as follows article a request for a statement of restriction on electoral rights may be submitted by the prosecutor the request must be submitted to the court in whose territorial jurisdiction is situated the home of the person in respect of whom the attestation of a restriction on electoral rights is requested the request may be submitted where an electoral commission has registered a list of candidates which includes a citizen in respect of whom there is evidence that subsequent to january he or she actively participated in the cpsu in the cpl .... a request concerning a person included in the list of candidates may also be submitted once the elections have already taken place the request must be accompanied by a statement from the electoral commission confirming that the person in question has stood as a candidate in elections and that the list in question has been registered as well as by evidence confirming the allegations made in the request. article after examining the request the court shall give its judgment finding that after january the person concerned did actively participate in the cpsu in the cpl declaring the request ill-founded and dismissing it the parliamentary elections act was enacted on may by the first parliament elected after the restoration of s independence otherwise known as the fifth legislature the first four legislatures having operated between and the following legislature the sixth elected in october examined three different proposals seeking to repeal section of the above-mentioned act at the plenary session of october the three proposals were rejected by large majorities after lengthy debates likewise on december during a debate on a proposal to restrict section the provision s current wording was confirmed elected in october the following legislature the seventh examined a proposal to repeal section at a plenary session on may after lengthy discussions the majority of members of parliament refused to accept the proposal finally the eighth legislature elected in october examined a similar proposal on january it was also rejected in a judgment of august in case no the constitutional court satversmes tiesa found that the restrictions imposed by section of the parliamentary elections act and section of the municipal elections act were compatible with the latvian constitution and with article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of protocol no in that judgment adopted by four votes to three the first reiterated the general principles laid down in the settled case-law of the convention institutions in applying article of the convention and article of protocol no it further held the argument that the provisions complained of forbidding certain latvian citizens from standing as candidates or being elected to parliament and municipal councils discriminate against them on the basis of their political allegiance is without foundation .... the impugned provisions do not provide for a difference in treatment on the basis of an individual s political convictions opinions but for a restriction on electoral rights for having acted against the re-established democratic order after january accordingly parliament limited the restrictions to the degree of each individual s personal responsibility individuālās atbildības pakāpe in carrying out those organisations objectives and programmes and the restriction on the right to be elected to parliament or to a municipal council is related to the specific individual s activities in the respective associations in itself formal membership of the above-mentioned organisations can not serve as a basis for preventing an individual from standing as candidate or being elected to parliament .... consequently the impugned provisions are directed only against those who attempted subsequent to january and in the presence of the army of occupation to re-establish the former regime through active participation ar aktīvu darbību on the other hand they do not affect persons who have differing political convictions opinions the tendency of certain courts to concentrate solely on the finding of the fact of formal membership and not to evaluate the person s behaviour is inconsistent with the objectives sought by parliament in enacting the provision in issue given that those organisations objectives were linked to the overthrow of the existing state regime pastāvošās valsts iekārtas graušana they were essentially unconstitutional consequently the aim of the restrictions on passive electoral rights is to protect the democratic state order national security and territorial integrity of the impugned provisions are not directed against pluralism of ideas in or against a person s political opinions but against those who through their active participation have attempted to overthrow the democratic state order .... the exercise of human rights may not be directed against democracy as such the substance and effectiveness of law is demonstrated in its ethical nature ētiskums a democratic society has a legitimate interest in requiring loyalty to democracy from its political representatives in establishing restrictions the candidates honour and reputation is not challenged in the sense of personal legal protection personisks tiesisks labums what is challenged is the worthiness of the persons in question to represent the people in parliament or in the relevant municipal council these restrictions concern persons who were permanent agents of the occupying power s repressive regime or who after january participated in the organisations mentioned in the impugned provisions and actively fought against the re-established latvian constitution and state the argument that democratic state order must be protected against individuals who are not ethically qualified to become representatives of a democratic state at political or administrative level is well-founded the removal from the list of a candidate who was involved in the above-mentioned organisations is not an arbitrary administrative decision it is based on an individual judgment by a court in accordance with the law evaluation of individual responsibility comes under the jurisdiction of the courts .... in order to determine whether the measure applied namely the restrictions on passive electoral rights is proportionate to the objectives being pursued namely the protection firstly of democratic state order and secondly of the national security and integrity of the latvian state it is necessary to assess the political situation in the country and other related circumstances parliament having evaluated the historical and political circumstances of the development of democracy on several occasions the court does not consider that at this stage there would be grounds for challenging the proportionality between the measure applied and its aim however parliament by periodically examining the political situation in the state and the necessity and merits of the restrictions should decide to establish a time-limit on these restrictions since such limitations on passive electoral rights may exist only for a specific period. three of the s seven judges who examined the above-mentioned case issued a dissenting opinion in which they expressed their disagreement with the majority s conclusions referring inter alia to the judgments in vogt v. germany of september series a no and rekvényi v. hungary gc no echr they argued that the disputed restrictions could be more extensive with regard to civil servants than to elected representatives according to those judges s democratic regime and institutional system had become sufficiently stable in the years since for individuals who had campaigned against the system ten years previously no longer to represent a real threat to the state consequently the restriction on those persons electoral rights was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued,case originated application lodged court january article european convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention latvian national ms

and shouting abuse the demonstrators were warned in greek and english that unless they dispersed they would be arrested in accordance with the laws of the trnc the applicant was arrested by the turkish-cypriot police after crossing the un buffer zone and entering the area under turkish-cypriot control the turkish-cypriot police intervened in the face of the manifest inability of the greek-cypriot authorities and the un force in to contain the incursion and its possible consequences no force was used against demonstrators who did not intrude into the trnc border area and in the case of demonstrators who were arrested for violating the border no more force was used than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances in order to arrest and detain the persons concerned no one was ill-treated it was possible that some of the demonstrators had hurt themselves in the confusion or in attempting to scale barbed wire or other fencing had the turkish police or anyone else assaulted or beaten any of the demonstrators the un secretary general would no doubt have referred to this in his report to the security council the applicant was charged tried found guilty and

barrier maintained by unficyp and destroyed an unficyp observation post they then broke through the line formed by unficyp soldiers and entered a former school complex where unficyp reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further a short while later turkish-cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended persons of them women b the ayios kassianos school complex is situated in the un buffer zone however the turkish forces claim it to be on their side of the cease-fire line under working arrangements with unficyp the turkish-cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions this patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last may c in the afternoon of july some greek cypriots gathered at the main entrance to the un protected area in in which the un headquarters is located to protest the continuing detention by the turkish-cypriot authorities of those apprehended at ayios kassianos the demonstrators whose number fluctuated between and blocked all un traffic through this entrance until july when the turkish-cypriot authorities released the last two detainees d the events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made both at the un headquarters and at to contain and resolve the situation on july i expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the un buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated i also urged the turkish-cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained on july the president of the security council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties on behalf of the members of the council the council 's deep concern at the tense situation created by the

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on february within the three-month period laid down by article para and article art art of the convention it originated in an application no against the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland lodged with the commission under article art by mr dennis sibson a british citizen on october the commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby the recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under article art of the convention in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of the rules of court the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him rule the chamber to be constituted included ex officio sir john freeland the elected judge of british nationality article of the convention art and mr r. ryssdal the president of the court rule para b on february in the presence of the registrar the president drew by lot the names of the other seven members namely mr j. cremona mr f. matscher mrs e. palm mr a.n loizou mr j.m morenilla mr f. bigi and mr m.a lopes rocha article in fine of the convention and rule para art subsequently mr c. russo substitute judge replaced mr cremona whose term of office had expired and whose successor at the court had taken up his duties before the hearing rules para and para mr ryssdal assumed the office of president of the chamber rule para and through the registrar consulted the agent of the united kingdom government the government the delegate of the commission and the applicant s lawyers on the organisation of the proceedings rules para and pursuant to the orders made in consequence the registrar received on the dates indicated a from the government a memorial and june and observations on the applicant s claims under article art of the convention october b from the applicant a memorial june a letter supplementing that memorial august and a statement of costs claimed under article art september in a letter of august the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would submit his observations at the hearing on august the commission filed a document which the registrar had sought from it on the president s instructions as directed by the president the hearing took place in public in the on october the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr eadie for the government mr marxer for the commission and mr bowers for the applicant as well as a reply to a question put by the president both the government and the applicant filed a written reply to a question put by the court the registrar received on november further observations from the government on the applicant s claims under article art and on january the applicant s comments on those observations mr sibson who was born in was employed by courtaulds northern spinning ltd formerly courtaulds northern textiles ltd cns from november as a heavy goods vehicle driver he was based at its depot at greengate lancashire together with between forty and fifty other drivers his services gave complete satisfaction at all times until the events giving rise to the present case the applicant was a member of the transport and general workers union tgwu from to he was its branch secretary in all the other non-managerial employees at greengate save one belonged to that union at that time however that depot was not a closed shop see paragraph below indeed the later of two statements of his terms of employment furnished to the applicant specified that he had the right to be a member of no trade union and that he would be informed if this right came to be modified by the conclusion of a closed shop agreement in march a fellow driver mr d. allegedly accused mr sibson of having milked the funds of the union whilst he was branch secretary the applicant subsequently lodged with the local tgwu branch a complaint to the effect that mr d. had disseminated false statements tending to depreciate him as one of its officers but it was dismissed by the branch adjudication panel on july mr sibson was so dissatisfied with that decision that he resigned from tgwu by letter of july and joined the united road transport union instead some of his fellow drivers immediately ostracised him and others obstructed him in the performance of his work between july and october cns attempted in vain to resolve the dispute after a period of uneasy peace a substantial majority of the tgwu members at greengate voted on october in favour of a a closed shop agreement with cns and b industrial action if mr sibson continued in employment at that depot after october at a meeting on october between mr dear the personnel manager of cns and the branch committee of the union it was agreed that the strike threat would be lifted if the applicant either rejoined tgwu or was employed on driving work not based at greengate on october the applicant told mr dear that he would rejoin the union only if he received an apology from mr d. and that he would not accept the alternative proposed by mr dear namely a move to chadderton a depot about miles away from greengate in a letter of the same date to the applicant mr dear summarised the discussions to date stated that cns were contractually entitled to transfer the applicant to chadderton where his earnings would be similar to those at greengate denied that the move would be a demotion and expressed the hope that the applicant would give serious thought to his position because his dismissal was a possibility further meetings were then held with the participation of a senior official of the advisory conciliation and arbitration service the applicant declined to accept as an apology a certain statement to be signed by mr d. as regards a transfer to chadderton the applicant expressed concern about conditions there in particular his fear which mr dear assured him was groundless of losing his current lorry and allowances for nights spent away from home he also said that he could not face the aggravation from other drivers which he was sure would continue at that depot at a final meeting on november the applicant declined to accept either of the alternatives then put before him working at greengate after rejoining tgwu or moving to chadderton and suggested that the management should dismiss him mr dear refused to do that and added that if the applicant reported to greengate for work he would be sent home without pay mr sibson citing his solicitor s advice that that would constitute constructive dismissal see paragraph below then said that he would resign with immediate effect which he did by letter of the same date he did not take up mr dear s further offer dated november of employment at chadderton with the same opportunity for earnings and expenses as previously mr sibson then lodged with the industrial tribunal a complaint of unfair dismissal see paragraph below against cns and tgwu in the grounds for his application he stated that he had been ‘ constructively dismissed for refusing to accept ‘ action short of dismissal see paragraph below his representative in these proceedings was not legally qualified legal aid not being available for this purpose cns and tgwu contended that a closed shop agreement was in existence which would have made any dismissal fair see paragraph below cns also denied that there had been either constructive dismissal or action short of dismissal mr dear admitted in cross-examination the absence of any operational reason for moving the applicant to chadderton the sole purpose being to avoid a strike had a strike not been threatened cns would have retained him at greengate and not put any pressure on him to rejoin tgwu by decision of july the industrial tribunal unanimously accepted the complaint of unfair dismissal it did not deal with the merits of the allegation of action short of dismissal it found that mr sibson was entitled to refuse to rejoin tgwu because there was no closed shop agreement in force that the request that he move to chadderton was not reasonable since it was not made for genuine operational reasons but solely to avoid a strike that cns had no right to suspend the applicant without pay that he was therefore entitled to treat himself as dismissed and that the dismissal was unfair because its only motive was his exercise of his express right not to belong to a union the tribunal reserved the question of remedies for further consideration the applicant having opted for re-engagement see paragraph below on january the employment appeal tribunal by a majority dismissed an appeal by cns on points of law it found that the industrial tribunal had not erred in law misdirected itself or reached an unreasonable conclusion on march the court of appeal unanimously upheld an appeal by cns on a point of law confined to the question whether mr sibson had been constructively dismissed it found that there was an implied term in his contract that his employer could for any reason direct him to work at any place within reasonable daily reach of his home the industrial tribunal had erred in law in holding that this right could be exercised only if the direction were reasonable and that this condition would not be satisfied unless the direction was made for genuine operational reasons lord justice slade stated as regards this implied mobility term i can not see how mr sibson could reasonably have objected to a term giving the contract this limited degree of flexibility when he entered the employment in if the evidence had disclosed any special circumstances which as at that time made it a matter of importance to him that he should be based at greengate rather than at say chadderton the industrial tribunal would no doubt have said so the court of appeal concluded that cns had acted within its contractual rights in requiring the applicant to transfer to a nearby depot and that he could not be regarded as having been constructively dismissed no question of unfair dismissal therefore arose on april mr sibson applied for legal aid to appeal to the house of lords on june legal aid was granted for the purpose of obtaining counsel s opinion on the merits of an appeal on august counsel advised that there were no reasonable prospects of success and that leave to appeal would not be given further legal aid was therefore refused on august the relevant domestic law in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case may be summarised as follows a closed shop is an undertaking or workplace where there is in existence a union membership agreement that is an agreement or arrangement between one or more trade unions and one or more employers or employers associations having the effect in practice of requiring employees of a certain class to be or become members of a specified union section of the trade union and labour relations act as amended the employment protection consolidation act the act provided that subject to exceptions not relevant to the present case every employee shall have the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer section the remedies for unfair dismissal were compensation or if the individual concerned so elected and if the industrial tribunal in its discretion so decided reinstatement or re-engagement section in determining whether to make a reinstatement or re-engagement order the tribunal had to take into account inter alia whether it was practicable for the employer to comply therewith section under section c of the act as substituted by section of the employment act subject to subsection the dismissal of an employee by an employer shall be regarded for the purposes of this part as having been unfair if the reason for it or if more than one the principal reason was that the employee by way of exception to the foregoing section of the act laid down the basic rule that if a union membership agreement i.e a closed shop see paragraph above was in existence the dismissal of an employee for refusal to become or remain a member of a specified union was to be regarded as fair with effect from july that is after the events giving rise to the present case this provision was repealed by the employment act in determining whether or not a dismissal was unfair an industrial tribunal was directed to take no account of pressure exercised on the employer to dismiss the employee for example by threatening to strike however a third party such as a trade union which had exercised such pressure because the employee was not a member of a union could be joined as a party to the proceedings and ordered to pay the whole or part of any compensation awarded to the employee sections and of the act the notion of constructive dismissal was encapsulated in section c of the act which provided an employee shall be treated as dismissed by his employer if the employee terminates his contract with or without notice in circumstances such that he is entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the employer s conduct it does not suffice in this connection that the employer s conduct is unreasonable it must amount to a significant breach going to the root of the contract of employment or showing that he no longer intends to be bound by one or more of its essential terms per lord denning master of the rolls in western excavating e.c.c ltd v. sharp industrial cases reports construing an earlier but identical provision section c of the act as amended by section of the employment act conferred on an employee defined by section of the act so as to include a person whose employment had ceased a right not to have action short of dismissal taken against him as an individual by his employer for the purpose of compelling him to be or become a member of any trade union or a particular trade union the remedy in well-founded cases was compensation which might extend beyond financial loss to such matters as injury to reputation and feelings of such amount as the tribunal considered just and equitable in all the circumstances provisions relating to the existence of a closed shop and to the exercise of pressure on the employer akin to those applicable in the context of unfair dismissal see paragraph above also applied in this area in his application no lodged with the commission on october mr sibson alleged that the compulsion imposed on him to join tgwu or to move to another depot was contrary to his rights under article art of the convention by decision of april the commission declared the application admissible in its report of december article art the commission expressed the opinion by eight votes to six that there had been no violation of article art the full text of the commission s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment at the hearing on october the applicant requested the court to uphold the admissibility of the complaint to uphold the complaint under article art and to grant full compensation under article art the government for their part invited the court to hold that the application

the case originated in five applications nos and against the republic of moldova lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by iurie roşca ştefan secăreanu petru buburuz anatol roşcovan and anatol eremia the applicants on july may and june and on march and april respectively the applicants were represented by mr. v. nagacevschi mr v. gribincea and mr v. constantinov lawyers practising in chişinău and members of the non-governmental organisation lawyers for human rights the moldovan government the government were represented by their agent at the time mr v. pârlog the applicants alleged in particular that their right to freedom of assembly had been violated as a result of sanctions imposed on them for organising and/or participating in unauthorised gatherings on november the court decided to join the applications and to give notice of them to the government under the provisions of article of the convention it decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility the applicants are members and/or sympathisers of the christian democratic people s party the cdpp a parliamentary political party in the which was in opposition at the time of the events towards the end of the government of moldova made public its intention to make the study of the russian language compulsory in schools for children aged seven and over this initiative prompted vehement criticism from the opposition and generated a heated public debate on december the parliamentary group of the cdpp informed chişinău municipal council of its intention to hold a meeting with its supporters on january in the square of the great national assembly in front of the government buildings it stated that the meeting would relate to the introduction of the compulsory study of russian in schools it relied on section of the status of members of parliament act see paragraph below which according to the cdpp did not require members of parliament to obtain prior authorisation for meetings with their supporters by a decision of january the municipal council classified the gathering to be held on january as a demonstration within the meaning of sections and of the assemblies act see paragraph below and authorised the parliamentary group of the cdpp to hold it in the square of the national opera it did not give any reasons for the change of location later on january the municipal council addressed a letter to the ministry of justice informing it that there was a discrepancy between the provisions of the status of members of parliament act and those of the assemblies act and that it did not know which to apply it stated inter alia that a number of reputable lawyers supported the idea that the cdpp members of parliament had the right to hold meetings with their supporters in the square of the great national assembly without obtaining prior authorisation in accordance with the provisions of sections and of the status of members of parliament act it cited in that connection the opinion of an ombudsman who considered that since section of the status of members of parliament act proclaimed the right of mps to raise demands on the spot for action to remedy a breach of the law the cdpp members of parliament were entitled to raise their demands for the cessation of the alleged breaches concerning the introduction of compulsory russian lessons in front of the government building as it also housed the ministry of education accordingly the municipal council requested the ministry of justice to ask parliament for an official interpretation of the legislation in question on january the municipal council issued a decision which stated inter alia having regard to the fact that the provisions of the domestic legislation are contradictory in respect of the demonstrations organised by the cdpp and that the opinions of legal experts are contradictory and bearing in mind the considerable social impact of a possible decision regarding the matter and the consequences it might entail the municipal council has formally requested the ministry of justice to ask parliament for an official and urgent interpretation of the relevant legislation the municipal council s decision of january is hereby suspended until parliament has given its official interpretation. in the meantime on january the parliamentary group of the cdpp held a gathering in the square of the great national assembly in front of government headquarters it also held gatherings on and january the cdpp informed the municipal council in advance of each gathering however it did not seek authorisation in accordance with the assemblies act on january the ministry of justice issued an official warning to the cdpp in accordance with section of the parties and other socio-political organisations act see paragraph below it stated inter alia that the cdpp had breached the provisions of section of the assemblies act by organising demonstrations in the great national assembly square on and january notwithstanding the authorisation issued by the municipal council which gave permission only for a demonstration on january in the square of the national opera it called for an immediate halt to the actions which it considered to be illegal and unconstitutional and which it claimed were not meetings with voters within the meaning of the status of members of parliament act but demonstrations falling under the assemblies act it asked the cdpp for a written explanation within three days and warned that if it failed to comply with the warning the ministry would impose a temporary ban suspendarea activităţii on the party s activities in accordance with section of the parties and other socio-political organisations act see paragraph below on january the president of the cdpp wrote a letter to the ministry of justice in which he stated that the gatherings had not been organised by the cdpp but by members of its parliamentary group and that it was therefore the members concerned who were liable and not the party he also relied on section of the status of members of parliament act arguing that it was a very specific act applicable to meetings between members of parliament and voters while the assemblies act was general in nature he finally submitted that the threatened ban on the party s activities would amount to a political measure on the part of the communist party in order to repress the opposition on january the ministry of justice issued a decision imposing a one-month ban on the cdpp s activites in accordance with section of the parties and other socio-political organisations act the measure was imposed on the basis of the organisation by the cdpp of unauthorised demonstrations on and january the ministry of justice dismissed the cdpp leader s argument that the party could not be held liable it stated inter alia that the gatherings organised by the cdpp on the above dates had in fact been demonstrations and marches and therefore fell within the scope of the assemblies act rather than the status of members of parliament act as the cdpp claimed according to the decision the cdpp had breached the provisions of sections and of the assemblies act by not obtaining prior authorisation from the municipal council to stage demonstrations and by blocking public roads the participation of minors in the cdpp demonstrations had been in breach of article of the international convention on the rights of the child section of the protection of children act and section g of the education act the cdpp s actions also disclosed a violation of sections and of the parties and other socio-political organisations act section and of the status of members of parliament act and article of the constitution the use of such slogans as i d rather be dead than a communist mai bine mort decât comunist could be interpreted as a call to public violence and an act undermining the legal and constitutional order on january the cdpp challenged the decision of the ministry of justice arguing inter alia that the gatherings had been meetings with voters within the meaning of the status of members of parliament act and not assemblies falling within the scope of the assemblies act on february the ministry of justice issued a decision lifting the temporary ban imposed on the cdpp s activities it stressed that the cdpp had breached all the laws mentioned in the decision of january and that the temporary ban had been necessary and justified however following the inquiry made by the secretary general of the council of europe under article of the convention and having regard to the forthcoming local elections the cdpp was authorised to resume its activities the decision of february did not however set aside the decision of january on march the court of appeal found in favour of the ministry of justice and ruled that the decision of january had been lawful it dismissed the cdpp s argument that the party could not be held liable for the actions of its members namely its parliamentary group it found that the gatherings organised by the cdpp had in fact been demonstrations meetings and marches which fell under the provisions of the assemblies act and not meetings with voters even assuming that the gatherings had been intended as meetings with voters they had gradually taken on the nature of demonstrations and accordingly the cdpp needed authorisation in order to organise them it also stated that as a result of the demonstrations the public transport company had suffered losses of moldovan lei mdl euros eur at the time the participation of minors in the demonstrations had been in breach of the international convention on the rights of the child the protection of children act and the education act the cdpp lodged an appeal against this decision with the supreme court of justice relying inter alia on articles and of the convention on may a panel of the supreme court of justice delivered its judgment in which it dismissed the appeal lodged by the cdpp it endorsed the arguments of the court of appeal and found inter alia that since the demonstrations organised by the cdpp had been illegal the sanction imposed on it had not been disproportionate it also stated that in any event the decision of the ministry of justice had not had any negative effects on the cdpp since it had not been enforced the cdpp s accounts had not been frozen and the party could continue its activities unhindered the ministry of justice did not reply to the municipality s request of january for interpretation of the law and did not address any request to parliament however on february the government lodged an application with the supreme court of justice asking it inter alia to declare the demonstrations organised by cdpp illegal and to order their cessation on february the supreme court of justice ruled in favour of the government and declared the gatherings illegal it stated inter alia that even if one could accept that the cdpp had the initial intention of holding meetings with its supporters those meetings later took on the character of demonstrations marches processions and picketing which fall under the provisions of the organisation and conduct of assemblies act in these circumstances the leaders of the cdpp were required to comply with the provisions of the assemblies act the cdpp appealed but on march the supreme court of justice dismissed the appeal and the judgment of february became final on unspecified dates the district police compiled administrative case files in connection with the applicants participation in unauthorised demonstrations the cases were referred to the buiucani district court by its decisions of february february january january and january respectively the buiucani district court found the applicants guilty of having participated in unauthorised demonstrations in breach of article of the code of administrative offences in particular the court found mr roşca and mr secareanu guilty of having organised and of having

the case originated in an application no against the republic of croatia lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by hrvatski liječnički sindikat croatian medical union hereinafter the applicant union on june the applicant was represented by mr s. posavec an advocate practising in zagreb with the law firm posavec rašica and liszt d.o.o the croatian government the government were represented by their agent ms š. stažnik the applicant union alleged that the decisions of the domestic courts prohibiting it from holding a strike had violated its freedom of association on september the application was communicated to the government the applicant union is a trade union of medical practitioners incorporated under croatian law its registered office is in zagreb on december the government of croatia on the one side and the autonomous trade union for the health service and social protection service of croatia the croatian professional trade union of nurses the trade union of workers in the health service social service and disability pension insurance of croatia and the applicant union on the other concluded the collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector kolektivni ugovor za djelatnost zdravstva i zdravstvenog osiguranja hereinafter the collective agreement or the main collective agreement its clause stipulated that the agreement would enter into force on january if approved by a majority of the votes cast in a referendum in which at least one third of those employed in the health-care institutions and the croatian health insurance fund voted the collective agreement was approved in the referendum held on january and entered into force as envisaged on january in order to regulate issues specific to doctors and dentists on december the government of croatia and the applicant union also concluded the collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector strukovni kolektivni ugovor za liječničku i stomatološku djelatnost which formed an annex hereinafter the annex to the above-mentioned main collective agreement clauses and of the annex stipulated that if doctors approved it in a referendum it would enter into force on january on december the autonomous trade union for the health service and social protection service of croatia and the croatian professional trade union of nurses instituted civil proceedings against the state and the applicant union seeking to declare the annex null and void because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded the main collective agreement contrary to the law for a more detailed description of the course of those proceedings see paragraphs below on december the government of croatia adopted an instruction whereby it a instructed the state attorney s office to acknowledge the plaintiffs claim in those proceedings because it was well-founded with a view to having the annex declared null and void and b instructed the ministry of health and social welfare to immediately commence negotiations on the conclusion of a new collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector meanwhile on december the referendum committee issued a decision to hold the referendum mentioned in the annex see paragraph above however on december the president of the socio-economic council gospodarsko-socijalno vijeće a tripartite body consisting of representatives of trade unions employers and the government set aside the decision on holding the referendum the referendum was nevertheless held on january of doctors voted voted yes and twenty-five voted no on january the president of the socio-economic council issued a decision not to recognise the results of the referendum in a letter to the ministry of health and social welfare of march the applicant union announced a strike for april it stated that the strike was being organised in order to a protect the social and economic interests of doctors by insisting that the government of croatia honour its obligations arising from the annex b have the results of the referendum on the approval of the annex recognised and c as an subsidiary ground for the strike address issues specific to doctors and dentists within the healthcare system by demanding that a collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector be concluded in particular as regards the last-mentioned ground the applicant union stated as follows addressing issues specific to doctors within the healthcare sector by concluding a collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector as a subsidiary ground for the strike the croatian medical union notes that the main collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector does not address issues specific to the medical and dentistry professions therefore on the instruction of the government of croatia and in accordance with the opinion of the socio-economic council of march the annex to that collective agreement addressing issues specific to doctors was concluded at the same time as the aforementioned collective agreement in that way issues specific to doctors within the healthcare and health-insurance sectors were comprehensively addressed given that at present the government of croatia refuse to apply the collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector i.e the annex and issues specific to the medical and dentistry professions including a salary increase and other pecuniary rights of doctors are not addressed in the main collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector a subsidiary ground for the strike is to demand that the government address issues specific to jobs and professions of doctors and dentists within the healthcare and health-insurance sectors. on the same day the ministry of health and social welfare invited the applicant union to conclude a new collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector in the form of an annex to the main collective agreement the draft of the new annex was enclosed with the ministry s letter the ministry emphasised that the draft envisaged a salary supplement amounting to of the basic salary of doctors and dentists in on account of their increased responsibility for the life and health of patients it also added that the other trade unions parties to the main collective agreement agreed with the draft and invited the applicant union to inform it within seven days whether it accepted the draft on march the applicant union informed the ministry that regrettably the proposed draft did not address the important issues specific to doctors and dentists within the healthcare sector on april the government of croatia adopted a decree whereby it unilaterally increased salaries of doctors and dentists by in see paragraph below on the same day april the state brought an action against the applicant union in the zagreb county court županijski sud u zagrebu asking the court to prohibit the announced strike the plaintiff argued that the announced strike would be illegal because it would seek to enforce the annex which had never entered into force given that the decision to hold the referendum required for its coming into force had been set aside see paragraphs and above by a judgment of april the county court found for the state and prohibited the strike it held that seeking compliance with the obligations arising from a collective agreement or the recognition of the results of a referendum were not permitted grounds for a strike under section of the labour act see paragraph below the relevant part of that judgment reads as follows from the cited provision that is section it follows that by using the formulation ‘ in order to protect and promote the economic and social interests the legislator clearly excluded enforcement of the rights stipulated in a particular collective agreement as a permitted ground for a strike because the individual and collective enforcement of rights stipulated in a collective agreement is regulated by sections and of the labour act as regards the subsidiary ground for the strike it has to be noted that the defendant s representative stated at the main hearing that this ground had been listed as subsidiary in case the annex was in the meantime declared invalid in the parallel proceedings pending before the municipal court finally it has to be concluded that a strike is legally allowed only in industrial disputes on matters that are not legally regulated and not in those which are given that the defendant insists on compliance with the annex it is evident that the matters in dispute are regulated by that annex and that the procedure for its entry into force is also legally regulated for which reason the substantive requirements for organising the strike are not satisfied. the applicant union then appealed against that judgment to the supreme court vrhovni sud republike hrvatske on april the applicant union held the strike as planned because under the domestic law its appeal prevented the county court s judgment from becoming final according to media reports the applicant union alleged that almost of some doctors and dentists had participated in the strike whereas the minister of health claimed that only of them had actually been striking while the others had merely expressed solidarity the minister also stated for the media that of the services had been rendered and that work stoppages occurred in one out of five clinical centres one out of seven university hospitals and in six out of general hospitals the strike lasted until april when the applicant union called it off in order to comply with the county court s subsequent provisional measure of april prohibiting the strike see the next paragraph following a request by the state on april the zagreb county court imposed a provisional measure prohibiting the strike until that court s judgment of april became final that is until the supreme court decided on the applicant union s appeal against the judgment on april the supreme court dismissed the applicant union s appeal against the decision imposing the provisional measure by a judgment of april the supreme court dismissed the applicant union s appeal against the county court s judgment of april see paragraphs above it held that the annex was invalid because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded the collective agreement contrary to section of the labour act see paragraph below and that therefore any further action based on that agreement including the strike was unlawful the relevant part of the supreme court s judgment reads as follows given that the annex was found to be invalid that is unlawful any further actions by the signatories of such an unlawful collective agreement such as calling for and holding a referendum as well as the two first grounds for the strike which are also based on the unlawful annex are also unlawful the view of the first-instance court that it was not necessary to address the third subsidiary ground for the strike is correct this is so because as stated by the defendant s representative at the hearing held on april this ground had been listed as subsidiary in case the annex was in the meantime declared invalid in the parallel proceedings pending before the municipal court a condition which has not been met. on may the applicant union lodged a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske against the supreme court s judgment alleging violations of inter alia its constitutionally-guaranteed right to strike and its freedom of association guaranteed by the convention in so doing the applicant union relied on article of the constitution see paragraph below and article of the convention on december the constitutional court dismissed the applicant union s constitutional complaint and served its decision on the applicant union s representatives on january the relevant part of that decision reads as follows having established that the contested judicial decisions were based on the relevant provisions of the labour act the constitutional court finds that those decisions were not in breach of the complainant s constitutional right provided in article paragraph of the constitution nor were they in breach of the international-law provisions the complainant relied on. meanwhile as already noted above see paragraph on december the autonomous trade union for the health service and social protection service of croatia and the croatian professional trade union of nurses brought a civil action in the zagreb municipal court općinski sud u zagrebu against the state and the applicant union seeking to declare the annex null and void on october the zagreb municipal court found for the plaintiffs and declared the annex null and void on december the zagreb county court dismissed the applicant union s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment which thereby became final on march the supreme court dismissed a subsequent appeal on points of law revizija lodged by the applicant union it endorsed the reasoning of the lower courts which had found the annex invalid because it had not been entered into by all the trade unions that had concluded the main collective agreement contrary to section of the labour act see paragraph below and clause of that collective agreement see paragraph below on march the constitutional court dismissed a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant union the relevant articles of the constitution of the republic of croatia ustav republike hrvatske official gazette no with subsequent amendments read as follows everyone shall be guaranteed the right to freedom of association for the protection of their common interests or for the promotion of social economic political national cultural and other convictions and aims for this purpose anyone may freely form trade unions and other associations join them or leave them in accordance with the law. in order to protect their economic and social interests all employees shall have the right to form trade unions and to freely join them or leave them. the right to strike shall be guaranteed the right to strike may be restricted in the armed forces the police the civil service and public services specified by law. the relevant provisions of the labour act of zakon o radu official gazette no with subsequent amendments which was in force between january and january at the material time provided as follows if more than one trade union exists in the sector in respect of which a collective agreement is to be concluded the employer may negotiate a collective agreement only with a bargaining committee composed of representatives of those trade unions. the parties to a collective agreement and persons to whom it applies shall comply with its provisions in good faith an injured party or a person to whom a collective agreement applies may claim compensation for the damage sustained as a result of non-compliance with the obligations arising from it. a party to a collective agreement may seek judicial protection of the rights arising from such an agreement by bringing an action in the competent court. trade unions and their higher-level associations have the right to call and undertake a strike in order to protect and promote the economic and social interests of their members or on the ground of non-payment of salary within thirty days of it becoming due. under the case-law of the croatian courts a strike is allowed only if its aim is the conclusion or revision of a collective agreement by converse implication a strike is illegal if a collective agreement exists that is so because in such a situation there is an obligation to maintain social peace which prohibits the calling of a strike in relation to matters that are already governed by a collective agreement the only exception to that rule is the non-payment of salary on which ground as of march when the amendments to the labour act entered into force trade unions may organise a strike in case no the supreme court interpreted section of the labour act see the preceding paragraph in the following terms in the supreme court s view having regard to section of the labour act a strike is lawful only in industrial disputes arising from a conflict of interests that is in disputes over issues that are not legally regulated but may be regulated by a collective agreement a strike is therefore a lawful means of industrial action if its purpose is to meet workers demands as regards matters that may be subject to a collective agreement even though the legislator does not explicitly exclude that a strike on issues which are legally regulated and thus susceptible to judicial or arbitral adjudication may be lawful the above legal view follows from the textual interpretation of section of the labour act and in connection with some other provisions of the same act by using the phrase ‘ to protect and promote the economic and social interests the legislator clearly excluded the enforcement of employment-related rights legal disputes as a permissible ground for a strike section indicates that means of pressure of which a strike is the means of last resort serve to protect and promote workers interests but not their rights which may only be protected during negotiations on the conclusion of collective agreements and not in matters that are governed by such agreements. in its judgment no gž of april the supreme court held that the rule contained in section of the labour act see paragraph above was not mandatory that is that parties to a collective agreement could agree otherwise and for example provide that a strike was allowed even while the collective agreement was in force in particular the supreme court held as follows section of the labour act reads ‘ trade unions and their higher-level associations have the right to call and undertake a strike in order to protect and promote the economic and social interests of their members the way in which this provision was drafted suggests that it is not mandatory there is no doubt that section of the labour act entitles trade unions to strike in cases of collective disputes that is as regards issues that may be but are not regulated by a collective agreement t he labour act has only provided for the protection of the basic rights of employees however there are many other sources of labour law governing employment-related rights and duties collective agreements may regulate employment relations in a manner more favourable for employees the question therefore arises whether a strike undertaken on grounds provided for in the collective agreement is lawful if the employer by signing a collective agreement agreed that the trade union could undertake a strike even in cases of a breach of that agreement by the employer then the strike can not be considered unlawful only because it was undertaken on that ground the relevant provision of the obligations act of zakon o obveznim odnosima official gazette of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia no with subsequent amendments and official gazette of the republic of croatia no with subsequent amendments which was in force between and october and december read as follows a contract that is contrary to the constitution mandatory rules or morals shall be null and void unless the purpose of the breached rule indicates some other sanction or the law in a particular case provides otherwise if the conclusion of a contract is prohibited only to one party the contract shall remain valid unless the law in a particular case provides otherwise and the party that has breached the statutory prohibition shall bear the relevant consequences. the relevant clauses of the collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector kolektivni ugovor za djelatnost zdravstva i zdravstvenog osiguranja official gazette nos and the collective agreement or the main collective agreement which was in force between january see paragraph above and december read as follows during the validity of this agreement trade unions shall not strike in respect of the matters regulated by this agreement the abstention from striking referred to in paragraph of this clause does not exclude the right to strike in respect of all other unresolved issues or in the case of a dispute concerning the amendment or supplement to this agreement trade unions shall have the right to organise a solidarity strike with other trade unions provided that prior notice is given in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. every party may propose amendments or supplements to this agreement proposals on behalf of trade unions for amendments or supplements to this agreement may be submitted by a bargaining committee. the relevant clauses of the collective agreement for the medical and dentistry sector strukovni kolektivni ugovor za liječničku i stomatološku djelatnost the annex which was declared null and void by a judgment of the zagreb municipal court of october that became final on december see paragraphs above read as follows this agreement is to be considered a special part of the main collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector in the event that a certain right is regulated differently by the main collective agreement for the health and health insurance sector the law that is more favourable for the employee shall apply. during the validity of this agreement the croatian medical union shall not strike in respect of matters regulated by this agreement unless they that is the obligations arising from the annex have not been complied with the prohibition of a strike referred to in paragraph of this clause does not exclude the right to strike in respect of any other unresolved issue. on april the government of croatia adopted the decree on a salary supplement for doctors and dentists uredba o dodatku na plaće doktora medicine i doktora stomatologije official

the case concerns the applicant s arrest including whether it was lawful and was based on a reasonable suspicion as required by article c of the convention the alleged failure of the domestic courts to provide relevant and sufficient reasons for his detention as required by article of the convention the alleged lack of impartiality of the tribunal in breach of article of the convention and the allegation that the applicant s prosecution and conviction were in breach of the requirements of articles and of the convention the applicant was born in and lives in yerevan the applicant was represented by ms l. sahakyan and mr e. varosyan lawyers practising in yerevan and mr a. ghazaryan a non-practising lawyer the government were represented by their agent mr g. kostanyan and subsequently by mr y. kirakosyan representative of the republic of armenia to the european court of human rights the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant was at the material time the deputy general prosecutor of armenia a post which he had occupied since january he also held the rank of first category state justice councillor in the past he had also occupied different high-level posts including the post of military prosecutor of armenia on february a presidential election was held in armenia the main contenders were the then prime minister mr sargsyan representing the ruling party and the main opposition candidate mr ter-petrosyan immediately after the announcement of the preliminary results of the election mr ter-petrosyan called on his supporters to gather at freedom square in central yerevan in order to protest against the irregularities which had allegedly occurred in the election process announcing that the election had not been free and fair from february onwards nationwide daily protest rallies were held by mr ter-petrosyan s supporters their main meeting place being freedom square and the surrounding park it appears that the rallies at freedom square attracted at times tens of thousands of people while several hundred demonstrators stayed in that area around the clock having set up a camp on february the applicant made a speech at the rally held at freedom square in which he expressed his support for mr terpetrosyan and criticised the conduct of the presidential election alleging various types of irregularities he called on those gathered not to give up and to stand by their votes saying that rule of law had to be finally established in armenia the applicant alleged that following that speech the authorities started persecuting him and his family members on the same date the general prosecutor applied to the president of armenia seeking to have the applicant dismissed on the ground that he had participated in a rally and made a political speech thereby violating the law which required prosecutors to maintain political neutrality and not to engage in political activities on february the president of armenia issued two decrees dismissing the applicant from the post of deputy general prosecutor and depriving him of his rank according to the applicant on february at around p.m. he his brother v.j. and four others had been travelling from ejmiatsin to yerevan in two cars after stopping at the intersection near argavand village they had been attacked by a group of masked and armed persons those persons had crashed their unmarked vehicle into the front of their car come out of it and firing their guns had surrounded the car he had surrendered himself and his weapon to those persons and had been taken into their car then those persons had tried to take v.j. who suffered from spinal tuberculosis and had mobility problems out of the car the attackers had started to break the car window and as v.j opened the door had hit him in the face with a pistol grip pulled him out of the car and thrown him to the ground ignoring the warnings about v.j. s spinal disease the attackers had continued shooting and injured v.j then the applicant his brother and two others together with their cars were taken into police custody according to an announcement made on the same day on the website of the armenian police entitled gagik jhangiryan is in custody operative information had been received at the principal department for the fight against organised crime hereafter the pdfoc that the persons driving two cars with indication of licence plates had been armed and intended to destabilise the situation in yerevan at around p.m. the above-mentioned cars had been pulled

his service gun inflicting light injuries on two other police officers and v.j. who had put up resistance the persons in question including the applicant v.j and two other persons accompanying them had been taken to the pdfoc a pistol had been found in the applicant s possession and two other pistols in the possession of v.j and one of the other two persons according to the record of bringing a person in the applicant was brought in to the pdfoc on february at around p.m. from the intersection of isakov avenue and argavand village by pdfoc officers g.g. a.m. and r.m on suspicion of illegal possession carrying and transportation of arms and ammunition and for showing resistance to police officers the applicant refused to sign the record on the same day the car accompanying the applicant was searched at the pdfoc and a browning-type pistol was found which also belonged to him on the same day a number of pdfoc officers filed reports with the chief of the pdfoc as follows several officers who had participated in the police operation described the circumstances of that operation including how v.j had allegedly put up resistance and punched officer r.m in the face one officer reported in particular that during the above police operation a b-type pistol had been retrieved which had a serial number and had been issued to the applicant on july for an indefinite period of time two officers a.h. and t.a. reported that while they were taking the applicant inside the pdfoc building the applicant in the courtyard of that building had disobeyed their lawful orders punched officer a.h. torn officer t.a. s uniform used swear words and made threats of retribution against them and their families several officers reported that while in the lobby of the pdfoc building the applicant and his brother had disobeyed the orders of police officers used swear words and made threats the applicant contested the above account of events and denied having assaulted the officers in question he alleged that at the time of his arrival at the pdfoc several hundred police officers had been present in the courtyard of the building and any resistance would have been pointless he further alleged that in fact it had been he and his brother who had been ill-treated by police officers in the lobby of the pdfoc the police officers had thrown them to the ground and started kicking and punching them when he had pleaded with them not to hit v.j because of his spinal disease they had started hitting v.j even more vigorously aiming at his spine on february at an unspecified time a criminal case was instituted under article life or health-threatening assault on a public official of the criminal code cc on account of v.j. s alleged use of violence against the police officers on the same date at a.m. a pdfoc investigator within the framework of the instituted criminal case drew up a record of the applicant s arrest indicating a.m. as the time of the applicant s arrest and stating that the applicant was arrested on suspicion of illegal acquisition possession and carrying of arms and ammunition as provided for by article of the cc in particular on february a b-type pistol had been found in his possession together with cartridges later on the same day another criminal case was instituted under article of the cc illegal acquisition possession or carrying of arms and ammunition in respect of the applicant which was joined with the first case alleging that the applicant in unknown circumstances had illegally acquired from an unidentified person a browning-type pistol loaded with mm cartridges which he had illegally kept in the vaz car accompanying him on february and which had later been found during the inspection of that car the investigator took statements from a number of police officers who confirmed the information provided earlier in their reports officers a.h. and t.a described in particular how the applicant had refused to step out of the car and how they had had to apply force in order to take him inside the pdfoc building during which he had punched officer a.h. torn officer t.a. s uniform used swear words and made threats no questions were posed by the investigator the browning pistol was subjected to a forensic examination which concluded on february that a digit had been added at the end of the serial number engraved by hand the applicant alleged that this had been done by the police officers after the seizure of the pistol which he had possessed and carried legally in order to create the appearance of an illegal nature of that pistol on february the applicant was formally charged under articles and non-life or health-threatening assault on a public official of the cc as regards the charge under article it was stated that the applicant under circumstances yet to be disclosed had illegally obtained a firearm namely a mm browning pistol together with its cartridges which he had illegally kept in the car accompanying him as regards the charge under article it was stated that after being taken to the pdfoc on a suspicion of illegally carrying a firearm the applicant while in the courtyard of the pdfoc building disobeying the lawful orders of the pdfoc officers to step out of the police car and to enter the building had punched officer a.h. in the shoulder as a result of which the officer had fallen down then the applicant had pulled and torn the uniform of another officer t.a. refused to enter the building and threatened the officers with violence and retribution on february at a.m. the applicant was brought before the kentron and nork-marash district court of yerevan which examined the investigator s application seeking to have him detained for a period of two months on the ground that he might abscond evade criminal responsibility obstruct the proceedings and commit an offence the applicant submitted before the district court that the charges against him were unsubstantiated in particular the browning pistol was a registered and licensed weapon and was legally owned by him it was not his responsibility if there had been a mix-up with its registration number furthermore he had voluntarily surrendered his pistol to the police officers during the raid and in any event all the weapons found in his and others possession were legal after arriving at the pdfoc he had been met by a large crowd of police officers who forcibly took him inside the building therefore the allegations of resistance or violence on his part were nonsense in any event there was no reason to believe that he a former deputy prosecutor general would obstruct the investigation or abscond while the gravity of the charges alone could not justify his detention the district court decided to allow the investigator s application finding that the circumstances of the case and the evidence obtained provided sufficient reasons to believe that if the applicant remained at large he could commit a new offence abscond or obstruct the proceedings on march the applicant lodged an appeal arguing inter alia that his detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion since he had possessed and carried the browning pistol legally and he had never used violence against officers a.h. and t.a furthermore the district court s decision was unreasoned since the risks of his absconding or obstructing the investigation had not been substantiated on march the criminal court of appeal dismissed the appeal finding that there was a reasonable suspicion from the materials submitted that the applicant had committed the imputed offences and that the district court s decision to detain the applicant was well-reasoned on march in the early morning a police operation was conducted on freedom square where several hundred demonstrators were camping as a result of which freedom square was cleared of all demonstrators resulting in clashes between the demonstrators and the police on the same date criminal proceedings were instituted regarding the events at freedom square on the grounds that the leaders of the opposition and their supporters had organised unlawful demonstrations incited disobedience and committed violence against the police for further details see mushegh saghatelyan v. armenia no september it appears that later that day the situation in yerevan deteriorated and the rallies continued in a number of streets until the early morning of march involving clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers and resulting in ten deaths including eight civilians numerous injured and a state of emergency being declared by the president of armenia on march another set of criminal proceedings was instituted on the grounds that the leaders of the opposition and their supporters had organised mass disorder in the streets of yerevan including murders violence and other reprehensible acts ibid. on the same date both sets of proceedings were joined and examined under no on march the investigator decided to join the applicant s criminal case to case no on april the district court extended the applicant s detention by two months finding that if the applicant remained at large he could abscond or obstruct the investigation by exerting unlawful pressure on the persons involved in the proceedings concealing or falsifying materials essential for the case or in some other way on april the applicant lodged an appeal arguing inter alia that the district court s decision was unreasoned and the risks of his absconding or obstructing the investigation were unsubstantiated on may the criminal court of appeal dismissed the appeal finding that the district court s decision to extend the applicant s detention was well-reasoned on june the investigator questioned the applicant in the main asking him to explain the speech he had made at freedom square on february on june the charge of illegal possession of a weapon under article of the cc was dropped on the ground that the applicant had a licence to keep and carry the browning pistol and it had not been possible to establish the circumstances under which the extra digit had been added to the serial number at the same time a new charge was brought against the applicant under article of the cc usurpation of power on the ground that he following the february presidential election had joined levon ter-petrosyan and his followers in masterminding and taking actions seeking to usurp power in particular the applicant using his standing as deputy general prosecutor had participated in discrediting the conduct of the election casting doubt on its lawfulness among the international community instilling distrust towards the results among large segments of the population creating illusions of public discontent and revolt and organising and conducting unlawful mass rallies aimed at destabilising the political situation in the country he had planned and taken actions seeking to isolate lawful public officials force them to resign and exercise power in their stead and made public speeches and calls of a provocative nature aimed at usurping state power on the same date the investigator requested that the applicant s detention be extended taking into account inter alia the fact that it was a voluminous and complex criminal case which required further numerous investigative measures and that beside the applicant a number of other individuals were accused under article of the cc including some who were in hiding on june the district court taking into account the nature and the gravity of the imputed offences extended the applicant s detention by two more months on the ground that if the applicant remained at large he could abscond obstruct the proceedings by exerting pressure on the persons involved in the proceedings and by his actions hinder the further disclosure of the circumstances of the case on june the applicant lodged an appeal arguing inter alia that his detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion and that the district court had failed to provide any reasons in support of its finding that he might abscond or obstruct the proceedings on july the criminal court of appeal dismissed the applicant s appeal finding that there was a reasonable suspicion from the materials submitted that the applicant had committed an offence and that the district court s decision to extend the applicant s detention was wellreasoned on august the charge of usurpation of power under article of the cc was dropped for lack of sufficient evidence it was stated that numerous investigative measures had been taken but no new evidence of the applicant s participation in usurpation of state power had been obtained on the same day the applicant s criminal case was disjoined from case no on august the investigation into the applicant s criminal case was completed and the case was referred to the district court for trial on august judge z.v of the district court decided to take over the applicant s criminal case and to set the case down for trial ruling that the applicant s preventive measure was to remain unchanged on september judge z.v examined a challenge lodged by the applicant seeking that the judge recuse himself from the examination of the case for lack of impartiality because his son a.v. who worked as an investigator was a member of the investigative team entrusted with the investigation of the case judge z.v noted at the outset that he was aware that his son had been a member of the relevant investigative team however since his son had not performed or taken part in any investigative measure carried out in respect of the applicant during the investigation of the case the judge found that he could still conduct an impartial examination since the fact that his son was a member of the investigative team did not in itself give rise to a reasonable doubt as regards his impartiality besides domestic law did not envisage the fact of involvement of a family member in the investigation of a case as a ground for recusal of a judge on february the judge examined and dismissed a request lodged by the applicant seeking to be released finding that it was still necessary to keep the applicant in detention during the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty and submitted that he had not put up any resistance during the police operation having arrived at the courtyard of the pdfoc building he had seen around to people gathered there he had then got out of the car and together with the persons accompanying him entered the pdfoc building his arrest had been effected by ten masked persons who had attacked him and his brother and subjected them to ill-treatment both at the time of arrest and in the lobby of the pdfoc building police officer a.h. testified that on february at about p.m. while at work he had received an instruction to accompany an arrested person from the courtyard into the lobby and to hand him over to the officers of the criminal intelligence unit the same instruction had been given to his colleague t.a as they approached the van parked in the courtyard the police officers had quickly got out of the vehicle and entered the building as t.a opened the van door they had recognised the applicant and requested that he step out of the vehicle the applicant had disobeyed and tried to kick them but they had managed to take him out forcibly and holding him by the arms had walked towards the building at that moment the applicant had managed to free his right hand and punch him in the shoulder as a result of which he had lost his balance and fallen down as t.a intervened the applicant while making threats and swearing at them and their family members had pulled and torn a pocket on t.a. s uniform then they had taken the applicant inside the building by forcibly twisting his arms and handed him over to the officers of the criminal intelligence unit police officer t.a gave similar testimony a number of other pdfoc officers also testified in court seven of them stated that the applicant had used swear words and made threats in the lobby of the pdfoc while fourteen of them who had overseen and/or participated in the police operation near argavand village including g.g. a.m. and r.m. described the circumstances of that operation stating inter alia that after arriving at the pdfoc they had been greeted by officers a.h. and t.a. and had immediately entered the building to report the incident the applicant requested that a number of persons be summoned as witnesses including four mps z.p. a.i. a.sak and a.d. and three other opposition supporters s.a. v.k and a.sis as regards the first four the applicant claimed that they had visited him in the remand prison on february and witnessed his bodily injuries sustained as a result of ill-treatment in police custody as for the last three the applicant argued that they had also been taken and kept at the pdfoc on february and allegedly possessed certain information regarding what had happened there the day before including being told by police officers that the applicant and his brother had been beaten on the previous day and overhearing the police officers discussing the case as being trumped up against the applicant the requests were dismissed by the district court on march the district court sitting in a single judge formation composed of judge z.v. found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years imprisonment the district court found it to be established as follows on february at around p.m. the applicant having been brought in to the courtyard of the pdfoc upon a suspicion of carrying illegal firearms and ammunition disobeying the lawful orders of public officials namely the police officers who were performing their official duties and inflicting non-life or healththreatening violence on them punched and caused pain to police officer a.h. whereupon he pulled and tore the uniform of an employee of the same department t.a refusing to enter the pdfoc building and at the same time threatening the police officers and their families with physical retribution the district court in examining the circumstances of the applicant s arrest near argavand village also found it to be established that the applicant had voluntarily given up his b-type pistol and that all the weapons retrieved during the police operation including those belonging to the applicant had been found following an inspection to have been possessed and carried legally in reaching the above findings the district court relied on the statements of police officers a.h. and t.a. and other officers who had testified in court as material evidence the district court cited officer t.a. s torn uniform the applicant s submissions and arguments were found to be unsubstantiated on april the applicant lodged an appeal arguing inter alia that the district court had failed to assess properly the evidence dismissed his submissions and refused his requests seeking to prove his innocence and based its findings solely on the testimony of the police officers he also alleged that the true reason for his prosecution and conviction was to punish him for the speech he had made at the opposition rally on february arguing that he had thereby been discriminated against on the basis of his political views he also argued that judge z.v had not been impartial because of the involvement of his son in the investigative team on may the court of appeal upheld the judgment of the district court and dismissed the applicant s appeal finding that the arguments contained therein were unfounded on june the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law on july the court of cassation declared the applicant s appeal inadmissible for lack of merit in the meantime on june the applicant was released under amnesty for a summary of the relevant domestic law as well as of the relevant international materials see mushegh saghatelyan cited above

overthrow of the constitutional order of armenia or violent breach of the territorial integrity of armenia was punishable by imprisonment for a period from ten to fifteen years article as in force at the material time provided as follows a judge is obliged to recuse himself if he is aware of facts or circumstances capable of raising a reasonable doubt as regards his impartiality in a particular case grounds for recusal include inter alia cases where a judge or his spouse or a person having kinship with him of up to the third degree may reasonably become or has reasons to believe that he will become a participant in the proceedings or has participated in the proceedings at a lower instance as a judge or as a participant in the proceedings a person s children parents sisters and brothers are considered as having kinship of the first degree with him within the meaning of this article on april the pace committee on the honouring of obligations and commitments by member states of the council of europe produced the report on the functioning of democratic institutions in armenia doc the relevant parts from the explanatory memorandum to this report produced by the co-rapporteurs provide the opposition received a boost in support when a number of high-level state officials publicly denounced the election as fraudulent and announced their support for mr levon ter-petrosyan these officials were subsequently dismissed from their positions and a number of them as well as several opposition activists were arrested on seemingly artificial charges which left the impression that their prosecution was politically motivated according to the helsinki association of armenia a total of persons were arrested and placed under investigation in the period from to february between

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a hungarian national ms éva molnár the applicant on february the applicant was represented by mr s. sz molnár a lawyer practising in the hungarian government the government were represented by mr l. höltzl agent ministry of justice and law enforcement the applicant alleged that the dispersal of the demonstration in which she had participated because of a mere lack of prior notification to the police had infringed her freedom of peaceful assembly within the meaning of article of the convention on november the court decided to give notice of the application to the government under the provisions of article of the convention it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility the applicant was born in and lives in the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows on first round and second round april legislative elections took place in the coalition which had governed the country from and therefore had been in charge of organising the elections lost their majority the official results of the elections were established by the local and regional electoral commissions following the second round after the courts had ruled on certain complaints concerning the legality and outcome of the voting procedure on may the national election committee made a public statement in the official gazette according to which the result had become final as in previous hungarian elections they were virtually identical to the results of the exit poll carried out on the day of the second round and to the preliminary results announced by the committee on the evening of april nevertheless views were subsequently voiced in certain sections of the media that the elections had been rigged international observers in particular the office for democratic institutions and human rights of the organization for security and co-operation in europe osce found that the parliamentary elections had been conducted in a manner consistent with international standards and that the hungarian election system had provided the basis for a generally transparent accountable free fair and equal process a period of two months elapsed during which a new government in a coalition of the ex-opposition parties was formed which took up its functions on may on the morning of thursday july several hundred demonstrators started to protest against the statutory destruction of the ballots scheduled for to july they blocked the centrally located erzsébet bridge in with their cars their objective was to force a recount of the election votes since they brought the traffic to a complete standstill and had not given prior notice of their gathering to the police as required by act no of on freedom of assembly the assembly act the

including spontaneous ones since the applicant did not deny that the demonstration in question had not been notified to the police as required by section of the assembly act the latter had not had any other choice but to break it up moreover the court found that the duty to inform the police in advance about assemblies held in public served the protection of the public interest and the rights of

the case originated in two applications nos and against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two turkish nationals mr ecevit piroğlu and mrs mihriban karakaya the applicants on august and august respectively the applicants were represented by ms e. yıldız and mr zeynel kaya respectively lawyers practising in the turkish government the government were represented by their agent on may the court joined the applications rule declared them partly inadmissible and decided to communicate to the government the complaints concerning both applicants right to a fair and public hearing and the second applicant 's right to freedom of expression and freedom of association under the provisions of article of the convention the court decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility the applicants were born in and respectively and live in they were members of the executive board of the izmir branch of the human rights association the association at the time of lodging their applications to the court there were two different sets of criminal proceedings brought against the applicants however it should be noted that the first applicant 's case concerned only the first set of proceedings regarding the association members with prior convictions on july the izmir governor sent a letter to the association requesting that the membership of thirteen persons including the second applicant be annulled as they were considered to be involved in illegal activities in this letter it is said that although the second applicant had been taken into police custody on april she had subsequently been released as it had not been established that she had any connection with the illegal tkp/ml-tikko the turkish communist party marxist-leninist–turkish workers and peasants liberation army on august the association replied to the governor that they would not comply with the request since none of these thirteen persons had prior convictions which would ban them from founding or becoming a member of an association as provided by section and and section of the associations act law no on october and october respectively the izmir public prosecutor informed the applicants that a prosecution had been initiated against them for non-compliance with section of law no but that no court proceedings would be initiated if they paid a fine of turkish liras trl per person within ten days the applicants did not pay the fine within ten days as required by the payment order subsequently on december the izmir public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicants and the other members of the board the public prosecutor requested that the accused be fined under section of the associations act and article of the criminal code for their failure to comply with the izmir governor 's request the bill of indictment was not notified to the applicants on december the izmir magistrates court without holding a hearing found the applicants and the other co-accused guilty as charged and by a penal order ceza kararnamesi fined them trl per person in doing so the court relied on the simplified procedure stipulated in article of the code of criminal procedure for relatively minor offences the applicants and the other co-accused lodged an objection with the izmir criminal court against the decision of december on february the izmir criminal court dismissed the objection without a hearing the applicants paid the amounts due subsequently on december one of the co-accused mr n.b. applied to the ministry of justice requesting the minister to refer the case to the court of cassation by way of a written order yazılı emir on january the minister of justice issued a written order and instructed the chief public prosecutor at the court of cassation to ask the court of cassation to set aside the judgment concerned on april the court of cassation quashed the judgment of the izmir criminal court dated february and the case file was remitted to the izmir magistrates court on may the izmir magistrates court held a preparatory hearing and included the case in its list it further decided to summon all of the defendants including the applicants to its next hearing on july august and october respectively the court held three hearings at its last hearing held on october the magistrates court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because following the promulgation of law no on april the sentence imposed on the applicants for not complying with the izmir governorship 's order had been classified as an administrative fine during the proceedings none of the defendants made submissions to the court on february the court of cassation upheld the decision of the izmir magistrates court the case file was sent to the governorship of izmir on october the association together with several local non-governmental organisations ngos took part in a civil society movement called the platform of conscientious objectors to war and made a collective press declaration in protest against the military operations of the united states of america usa in afghanistan on an unspecified date the prosecutor notified the second applicant that a prosecution had been initiated against her under section of the associations act for her involvement with the platform of conscientious objectors to war an organisation without any lawful status the prosecutor also informed the applicant that no court proceedings would be initiated if she paid a fine of trl within ten days in the absence of payment the prosecutor filed an indictment on december charging the second applicant and five other board members of the association with a violation of section of the act in the indictment the prosecutor stated that the platform had no legal basis under turkish law the bill of indictment was not served on the second applicant on december the magistrates court following the simplified procedure and thus without a hearing convicted the second applicant as charged case no by issuing a penal order it sentenced her to an increased fine of trl however the court suspended the sentence pursuant to section of law no on the execution of sentences on february the second applicant lodged an objection with the i̇zmir criminal court against the penal order she argued that her conviction infringed her right to freedom of expression and that a collective press declaration could not be classified as a contribution to the establishment of an unlawful organisation she further complained that the indictment had not been communicated to her and that the court had not obtained statements or heard counter-evidence from her on february the criminal court dismissed her objection again without holding a hearing the relevant articles of the code of criminal procedure which was in force at the time of the events read as follows article unless otherwise specifically provided by law objection proceedings are conducted without a hearing if necessary the public prosecutor may be heard. article as regards infringements falling within its jurisdiction the magistrates court makes its ruling without holding a hearing through a penal order the order can only be given in cases of simple or aggravated fines or in relation to offences carrying a maximum prison sentence of three months article the judge schedules a hearing if he sees an inconvenience in ruling in the absence of one. article a hearing shall be held if an objection is raised to a prison sentence imposed by a penal order the suspect can be represented by defence counsel during the hearing objections to penal orders are examined by a judge at the criminal court of first instance in line with the procedure described under articles and the objection would suspend the execution of the penal order. in a judgment given on june the declared article of the code of criminal procedure unconstitutional and a nullity it held that the lack of a public hearing before the criminal court of first instance which examines objections to penal orders would be a deprivation of the right guaranteed by article of the convention as well as article of the constitution article of the code of criminal procedure concerning references to the court of cassation by written order of the minister of justice yazılı emir ile bozma the reference by written order provides where the minister of justice has been informed that a judge or court has delivered a judgment that has become final without coming under the scrutiny of the court of cassation he may issue a formal order to the chief public prosecutor requiring him to ask the court of cassation to set aside

issued a permit to hold an assembly in an area in divupiai village next to but not closer than twenty-five metres from the vilnius-klaipėda highway from a.m. to p.m. between and may the permit specified that it granted the right to organise a peaceful assembly in compliance with the provisions set forth inter alia in the constitution and in the law on assembly it was also indicated therein that the organisers and the participants were to observe the laws and to adhere to any orders from the authorities and the police failure to do so could engage their administrative or criminal liability the second applicant b.m. who was indicated as one of the organisers of the gathering signed a receipt for the notification of the permit the klaipėda police received information about the demonstrators possible intention to overstep the limits established by the permits b.m was therefore contacted by telephone and a meeting with him was organised in order to avoid unlawful acts being carried out during the demonstrations the demonstrations started on may the farmers gathered in the designated areas on may the farmers blocked and continued to demonstrate on the roads next to divupiai village on the vilnius-klaipėda highway at the sixty-third kilometre of the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway and at the ninety-fourth kilometre of the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway the government pointed out that the police had not received any prior official notification of the demonstrators intention to block the three major roads of the country they described as follows the behaviour of the farmers and of the applicants during the demonstrations a on may at around noon a group of approximately people walked onto the vilnius-klaipėda highway and remained standing there thus stopping the traffic b on may at noon a group of approximately people walked onto the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway and remained standing there thus stopping the traffic the blockade remained in place until noon on may the first applicant encouraged the demonstrators to move from the car park onto the highway c on may at a.m. a group of people walked onto the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway and remained standing there thus stopping the traffic in addition on the same day between and p.m. the third fourth and fifth applicants drove tractors onto the highway and left them there the blockade remained in place until p.m. on may on may the farmers continued negotiations with the government the next day following a successful outcome to those negotiations the farmers stopped blocking the roads the parties disagreed as to the extent of the disruption to traffic created by the farmers demonstrations according to the applicants see paragraph below knowing that blockades were likely to occur the police had prepared alternative road itineraries in the vicinity of the places where the demonstrations were held so that the roadblocks would not disrupt the flow of goods indeed on the days in question the latter had been even better than usual this could be proven by the data from posts where the roadblocks took place in a letter of august addressed to the applicants lawyer the state border guard service indicated that several queues of lorries ranging from to kilometres long had formed from until may in both directions in the proximity of the kalvarija border crossing between lithuania and poland according to the same letter there were no queues of passenger cars moreover no queues had formed at the lazdijai state border post another post on the lithuanian-polish border the government observed firstly that the vilnius-klaipėda highway was the main trunk road connecting the three biggest cities in the country while the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway otherwise known as via baltica and the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway were transitional trunk roads used to enter and leave the country according to the government all three roads were blocked at locations next to the customs post for approximately forty-eight hours the government alleged in particular that owing to the blocking of the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway which prevented vehicles from passing through border control queues of heavy goods vehicles and cars formed in lithuania and poland at the kalvarija border crossing the heavy goods vehicles were forced to drive along other routes in order to avoid traffic jams as the functioning of the kalvarija customs post was disrupted the kaunas territorial customs authority was obliged to re-allocate human resources as well as to prepare for a possible reorganisation of activities with the state border guard service and the polish customs as a consequence the kaunas territorial customs authority incurred additional costs however the concrete material damage had not been calculated according to a report of the kalvarija police the road was blocked on may the lorries returning to lithuania from poland were directed by the police to a car park at the kalvarija border crossing at around a.m. the lorry drivers approached the farmers they demanded an end to the roadblocks under threat of physical force the police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down and to wait for the outcome of the negotiations between the farmers and the prime minister according to the government the farmers and the lorry drivers had a few arguments but more serious confrontations were avoided at around p.m. the farmers received a telephone call regarding the positive outcome of the negotiations and moved one tractor off the road the traffic then resumed in both directions the government also noted that owing to the blocking of the vilnius-riga highway on may from until p.m. heavy goods vehicles could not cross the border and queues of traffic of and metres respectively appeared in both directions cars took diversions along a gravel road on september the pasvalys police issued a certificate stating that between and may the farmers had held a demonstration in the car park at the sixty-third kilometre of the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway on may at around midday the farmers had gone onto the highway and had stopped the traffic they had only allowed through passenger vehicles and vehicles carrying dangerous substances goods vehicles and cars were allowed to go through ten at a time on each side of the road once every hour in order to improve the situation the police had attempted to let the traffic bypass the blockade through neighbouring villages however owing to the poor condition of those neighbouring roads not all goods vehicles were able to drive on them and they had to remain on the highway until the farmers had left some lorries became stuck in sand and special machinery was necessary to pull them out the police indicated that the farmers had unblocked the highway at p.m. on may as can be seen from the documents submitted to the court in may and september four logistics companies informed the police and linava the lithuanian national road carriers association that they had sustained pecuniary damage in the sum of lithuanian litai ltl approximately euros eur as a result of the roadblocks during the farmers demonstrations the companies stated that they would institute court proceedings in respect of those claims the government alleged that notwithstanding the fact that only one claim for pecuniary damage was ultimately lodged see paragraph below more than one carrier company incurred material loss owing to the disruption of traffic as submitted by linava vilniaus dobilas incurred damage amounting to ltl approximately eur rokauta incurred damage amounting to ltl approximately eur and immensum incurred damage amounting to ltl approximately eur moreover in a letter of may the company ridma indicated that the loss incurred by them owing to the roadblocks amounted to ltl approximately eur pre-trial investigations against the applicants and a number of other persons on suspicion of having caused a riot were initiated in july b.m. v.m. a.p and k.m were ordered not to leave their places of residence that measure was lifted in october on october the police imposed a fine of ltl approximately eur on a farmer a.d according to the applicants it was established in the police record relating to the fine that on may a.d. had taken the farmers to block the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway in the kalvarija municipality he had walked in the middle of the road pushing a cart in front of him thus obstructing the traffic by such actions a.d. had breached paragraph of the road traffic regulations see paragraph below and thus committed an administrative-law violation as provided for in article of the code of administrative law offences see paragraph below the government noted that the criminal proceedings against a.d. were discontinued on august as he had not organised or provoked a gathering to seriously breach public order his act walking in the middle of the road pushing a cart in front of him was not considered to fall under article of the criminal code see paragraph below the government further noted that the criminal proceedings had been discontinued on similar grounds in respect of three other persons in respect of a fourth person the criminal prosecution was discontinued owing to his immunity as a member of parliament on december an indictment was laid before the courts b.m and a.k were accused of incitement to rioting under article of the criminal code the prosecutor noted that b.m had taken part in the farmers meeting of may at which the farmers had decided to hold demonstrations near major highways on may and should the government not satisfy their requests by a.m. on may to blockade those highways on may b.m had told the farmers to blockade the roads on may as a result at p.m. on that date around farmers had gone onto the vilnius-klaipėda highway the farmers had refused to obey police requests not to stand on the road consequently traffic had been blocked until p.m. on may traffic jams had occurred on neighbouring roads and road transport in the region had become impossible with regard to a.k. the prosecutor claimed that he had also incited the farmers to blockade the highway as a result at midday on may approximately people had gone onto the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway refusing to obey police orders not to block the highway the road had remained blocked until a.m. on may the roads in the vicinity had become clogged the normal functioning of the saločiai-grenctale border-control post had been disrupted v.m. k.m and a.p were accused of a serious breach of public order during the riot under article of the criminal code the prosecutor maintained that on may at around a.m. approximately people had gone onto the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway at the ninety-fourth kilometre at about or p.m. the above-mentioned applicants had driven three tractors onto the highway and had left them on the carriageway the three applicants had refused to follow police instructions not to breach public order and not to leave the tractors on the road the tractors had remained on the road until p.m. on may as a result the highway had been blocked from the eighty-fourth to the ninety-fourth kilometre due to the resulting increase in traffic on neighbouring roads congestion had built up and road transport in the region had come to a halt the normal functioning of the kalvarija and marijampolė state border-control posts had been disrupted within the criminal proceedings a logistics company brought a civil claim against a.k. as the person who had incited the farmers to block the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway seeking damages of ltl approximately eur for the loss allegedly incurred by it owing to the blockading of that road several hearings during which a number of witnesses testified took place before the kaunas city district court on september the kaunas city district court found the applicants guilty of incitement to rioting or participating in them under article of the criminal code in convicting b.m. the district court relied on video-recordings of the events documentary evidence and the testimony of one witness the court concluded that b.m had organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order namely by rioting b.m had been one of the leaders of the farmers meeting on may at which the farmers had decided to attempt to achieve their goals by organising protests next to major highways the district court noted that b.m had coordinated the actions of the farmers and as a consequence on may approximately people had gone on to the vilnius-klaipėda highway and had blocked it as a result traffic had been blocked until may the ensuing serious breach of public order had been deliberate and had to be characterised as a riot the district court dismissed b.m. s claim that he and other farmers had acted out of necessity because the roadblock had been their last opportunity to draw the government s attention to their problems the farmers had had an alternative namely they could have brought complaints before the administrative courts the farmers had themselves mentioned that alternative during the meeting of may see paragraph above the district court further noted that a person who created a dangerous situation by his or her actions could only rely on the defence of necessity when a dangerous situation arose through negligence article of the criminal code see paragraph below however the actions of b.m had been deliberate and it was therefore appropriate to find him guilty of organising the riot the district court found it established mainly on the basis of video-recordings and documentary evidence that a.k had also organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order he had taken part in the farmers meeting of may and had known about the decision to hold protests next to the roads when a crowd of farmers had blocked the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway on may public order had been seriously breached traffic had been stopped on that part of the road causing inconvenience to drivers and goods carriers the district court held that during the blockade of and may a.k coordinated the actions of the crowd that is to say he gave orders that some of the vehicles should be let through incited the farmers to hold on and not to move away from the highway was in contact with the participants in the protests in the kalvarija municipality and the klaipėda region and was negotiating with the authorities by mobile phone in the name of the farmers the district court emphasised that the farmers who had gathered approximately people obeyed the actions of a.k and followed his orders for the district court the actions of a.k were to be characterised as organising a riot under article of the criminal code on the basis of written evidence submitted by linava the district court also found that by organising the blockade of the panevėžys-pasvalys-riga highway a.k had caused pecuniary damage to three carrier companies as one of the carriers had submitted a civil claim for the sum of ltl approximately eur see paragraph above the district court deemed it proper to grant that claim in finding v.m. k.m and a.p guilty of causing a serious breach of public order during a riot the district court on the basis of documentary evidence audio-visual material and the testimony of two witnesses established that on may between a.m. and p.m. the three of them had driven tractors onto the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway at the ninety-fourth kilometre they had refused to obey lawful orders by the police not to breach public order and not to park the tractors on the road ant važiuojamosios kelio dalies and had kept the tractors there until p.m. on may as a consequence and because about people had gathered on the road the traffic had been blocked from the eighty-fourth to the ninety-fourth kilometre of the kaunas-marijampolė-suvalkai highway traffic jams had occurred and the normal functioning of the kalvarija and lazdijai border-control posts had been disrupted the five applicants were each given a sixty-day custodial sentence baudžiamasis areštas the district court also noted that all the applicants had positive characteristics and that there were no circumstances aggravating their guilt accordingly there was reason to believe that the aim of the punishment could be achieved without actually depriving them of their liberty consequently the district court suspended the execution of their sentences for one year the applicants were ordered not to leave their places of residence for more than seven days without the authorities prior agreement this measure was to last for one year while execution of the sentence was suspended the district court also acquitted for lack of evidence two other individuals charged with organising the riots on october the applicants lodged an appeal with the kaunas regional court they noted inter alia that another farmer a.d. had been punished only under administrative law for an identical violation see paragraphs above the applicants further argued that in european union member states roadblocks were accepted as a form of demonstration and that the right to demonstrate was guaranteed by articles and of the convention they referred inter alia to article of council regulation ec no of december see paragraph below and to a report of march by the commission of the european communities com on the application of that regulation as well as to the judgment of the court of justice of the european communities ecj in eugen schmidberger internationale transporte und planzüge v. austria see paragraphs below on january the kaunas regional court found that the district court had thoroughly and impartially assessed all the circumstances of the case the regional court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order public safety and public health human dignity and the inviolability of property the objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal namely to breach public order and the implementation of their decision which in the instant case had been to organise the roadblocks to constitute an offence the actions also had to be committed deliberately that is to say the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour in relation to b.m and a.k. the regional court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads it had been established that b.m and a.k had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers even so they had continued to coordinate the farmers actions and had insisted that the farmers maintain the roadblocks as a direct result of the actions of b.m and a.k. on may a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order the regional court also shared the district court s conclusion as to the reasonableness of convicting v.m. k.m and a.p it noted that by driving tractors onto the highway thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the state border-control service and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road the three applicants had seriously breached public order the fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers with the result that some of the drivers had been let through did not diminish the danger caused by the offence or its unlawfulness the regional court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative-law offence such as a traffic violation as to the applicants argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer a.d. had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation see paragraph above the regional court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence while noting that the applicants had the right to freedom of expression under article of the convention the regional court nevertheless observed that such right was not without restrictions should the interests of public order and prevention of crime be at stake analogous limitations to freedom of expression were listed in article of the lithuanian constitution see paragraph below on this issue the regional court emphasised that the behaviour of b.m and a.k. in guiding the actions of the other individuals involved in the protest could not be regarded as a non-punishable expression of their opinion because they had breached public order thus engaging criminal liability the regional court further noted that the criminal offence had not lost its element of danger to the public merely because the government had refused to raise wholesale prices or had allegedly failed to take the necessary action on march the applicants appealed on points of law on october the supreme court composed of an enlarged chamber of seven judges see paragraph below dismissed the appeal in providing an explanation as to the substance of the offence of rioting as defined in article of the criminal code see paragraph below the supreme court referred to its classification as an offence against public order which was the objective aspect of the crime nusikaltimo objektas in describing the scope of the offence the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence damaging property or otherwise breaching public order or the commission of those actions during a gathering for the supreme court a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order caused public violence or damaged property the subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia the guilty person had to i be aware that he or she was performing an action that was listed as an offence in article of the criminal code and ii wish to act accordingly turning to the circumstances of the present case the supreme court found that the courts below had been correct in characterising the applicants actions as falling under article of the criminal code in particular the trial court had properly established all the prerequisites for the application of article namely that there had been a crowd and that public order had been breached by blocking the highways stopping traffic and disturbing the work of the state border-control service the applicants had been sentenced for their offences under a law in force at the time they were committed and their sentences had been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the criminal code it followed that the applicants convictions had been in accordance with the law and not in breach of article of the convention the supreme court also stated that the applicants had not been sentenced for expressing their opinion or imparting ideas actions which were protected by the guarantees of article of the convention but for actions by which they had seriously breached public order lastly the supreme court shared the regional court s view that the applicants could not be regarded as having acted out of necessity see paragraph above the fall in milk purchase prices and other problems with subsidies for agriculture had not constituted a clear or present danger to property because the property in question had not yet materialised the state had not deprived the applicants of their property and their dissatisfaction with the government s agricultural policy had not justified the acts for which the applicants had been convicted by court rulings of october and november the supreme court discharged the applicants from their suspended sentences articles and of the constitution read as follows a natural person shall have the right to have his own convictions and to freely express them a natural person must not be hindered from seeking receiving and imparting information and ideas freedom to express convictions and to receive and impart information may not be limited other than by law if this is necessary to protect the health honour and dignity private life and morals of a natural person or to defend the constitutional order freedom to express convictions and to impart information shall be incompatible with criminal actions such as incitement to national racial religious or social hatred violence and discrimination or slander and disinformation article citizens may not be prohibited or hindered from assembling unarmed in peaceful meetings this right may not be limited other than by law and only when it is necessary to protect the security of the state or society public order people s health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others. on october the criminal code was published in the official gazette valstybės žinios and it came into force on may article establishes criminal liability for rioting which is categorised as a public-order offence and provides as follows a person who organises or provokes a gathering of people to commit public acts of violence damage property or otherwise seriously breach public order or a person who during a riot commits acts of violence damages property or otherwise seriously breaches public order is liable to be sentenced to a short-term custodial sentence baudžiamasis areštas or to imprisonment for up to five years. article and stipulates that if a person is sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years for the commission of one or several minor or less serious premeditated offences a court may suspend the sentence for a period ranging from one to three years the sentence may be suspended when the court rules that there is a sufficient basis for believing that the aim of the punishment will be achieved without the sentence actually being served when suspending execution of the sentence the court may order the convicted person not to leave his or her place of residence for a period exceeding seven days without the prior agreement of the authority supervising the execution of the judgment pursuant to article individuals convicted of a crime and whose conviction has become final are regarded as offenders having a previous conviction any person given a suspended sentence is considered as having a previous conviction during the period of suspension of the sentence article defines the concept of necessity būtinasis reikalingumas it states that a person is not to be held criminally liable for an act committed in an attempt to avert an immediate danger which threatens him or her other persons or their rights or public or state interests where this danger could not have been averted by other means and where the damage caused is less than the damage which it is intended to avert nonetheless a person who creates a dangerous situation by his or her actions may only rely upon the defence of necessity when the dangerous situation arose through negligence dėl neatsargumo article of the code of administrative law offences at the relevant time provided for administrative liability for a breach of traffic regulations by drivers the provision stipulated that a breach of the regulations on how and when a driver could stop and park on highways carried a fine ranging from ltl to ltl approximately eur article of the code provided for administrative liability for the non-observance by pedestrians of traffic signs or for crossing or walking on a carriageway the offence was punishable by a fine of ltl approximately eur the road traffic regulations provide that pedestrians must walk on the pavement and if there is none on the right side of the road in single file paragraph of the regulations in so far as relevant the law on assembly provides as

gathering and other persons or breaches public order and peace a gathering shall be terminated by the police officers whose duty it is to ensure observance of the law during the course thereof if when publicly warned the organisers of or participants in the gathering commit a deliberate and gross breach of the procedure for organising gatherings as laid down by the present law by making use of the opportunities afforded by a gathering attempt to commit or commit crimes against the independence territorial integrity and constitutional order of the state of lithuania or other deliberate criminal acts against a person s life health freedom honour and dignity or against public safety governance and public order individually or by group actions disturb or cause an actual threat to disturb traffic or the activities of state establishments organisations and local authorities violation of the law on assembly shall carry a fine ranging from ltl to ltl or result in administrative arrest of up to thirty days breaches of public order at other large-scale events shall carry a fine ranging from ltl to ltl the law on courts at the material time provided that the supreme court established uniform judicial practice in interpreting and applying laws and other regulations the supreme court also analysed the practice of courts and gave recommendations to be followed depending on the complexity of the case the supreme court could decide cases in chambers of three or seven judges or in plenary session articles and the ecj examined the issue of obstruction to the free movement of goods in commission of the european communities v. france judgment of december the commission case concerning serious incidents which occurred in the south of france agricultural products from spain and italy had been destroyed by french farmers and acts of violence and vandalism had been committed in the relevant wholesale and retail sectors the ecj emphasised that in accordance with the ec treaty the european internal market was characterised by the abolition between member states of obstacles to the free movement of goods article of the treaty prohibited between member states quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect therefore all barriers whether direct or indirect actual or potential to flows of imports in intra-community trade had to be eliminated article read in conjunction with article of the treaty also applied where a member state abstained from adopting the measures required in order to deal with obstacles to the free movement of goods which were not caused by the state the ecj accepted that states enjoyed a margin of discretion in determining what measures were more appropriate in this field it was however clear that the acts of violence committed in france against agricultural products originating in other member states created obstacles to intra-community trade in those products the incidents in issue had taken place regularly for more than ten years in certain cases the french authorities had been warned of the imminence of demonstrations by farmers the disruption had continued for several hours and the acts of vandalism committed by persons whose faces were often not covered had been filmed by television cameras in spite of this only a very small number of perpetrators had been identified and prosecuted this was sufficient for the ecj to come to the conclusion that the measures adopted by the french government were manifestly inadequate to ensure freedom of intra-community trade in agricultural products on its territory and that france had failed to fulfil its obligations under article taken in conjunction with article of the ec treaty this had created a climate of insecurity which had had a deterrent effect on trade flow as a whole and the difficult situation of french farmers could not justify a failure to apply community law correctly as it had not been shown that implementation of that law would have posed a danger to public order with which the state could not cope it was true that the threat of serious disruption to public order might in appropriate cases justify non-intervention by the police however this argument could have been put forward only with respect to a specific incident and not in a general way covering all the incidents in issue in eugen schmidberger internationale transporte und planzüge v. austria judgment of june the schmidberger case the ecj gave a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of articles and now articles and of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu read together with article of the ec treaty repealed and replaced in substance by article of the treaty on european union teu and on the conditions for liability of a member state for damage caused to individuals by a breach of community law the case originated in the permission implicitly granted by the austrian authorities to an environmental group to organise a demonstration on the brenner motorway the effect of which was to completely close that motorway to traffic for almost thirty hours in conjunction with a pre-existing national generally applicable ban on holiday driving this caused the brenner motorway an essential intra-community transit route to be closed to the majority of heavy goods traffic for four consecutive days with a short interruption of a few hours after referring to the principles laid down in the commission case see paragraphs above regarding the positive obligations of the member states in this area the ecj held that the fact of not banning the demonstration complained of amounted to a restriction of the free movement of goods it went on to consider whether the failure to impose a ban could be objectively justified it observed that the specific aims of the demonstration were in themselves immaterial to establish the liability of the member state under the ec treaty only the objective pursued by the national authorities namely respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly being relevant both the free movement of goods one of the fundamental principles of the ec treaty and the rights guaranteed by articles and of the convention could be subject to certain restrictions for overriding requirements relating to the public interest it remained to be ascertained whether the restrictions to the free movement of goods tolerated by austria were proportionate to the legitimate objective pursued in this connection the ecj noted that the case in schmidberger could be distinguished from that in the commission case in that a the demonstrators had requested an authorisation b the obstacle to the free movement of goods was limited geographically c the aim of the demonstrators was not to restrict trade in goods of a particular type or from a particular source d various administrative and supporting measures publicity campaign designation of various alternative routes security arrangements on the site of the demonstration had been taken by the competent authorities in order to limit as far as possible the disruption to road traffic and e the demonstration did not give rise to a general climate of insecurity such as to have a dissuasive effect on intra-community trade flow as a whole under these circumstances austria was entitled to consider that an outright ban on the demonstration would have constituted unacceptable interference with freedom of peaceful assembly and stricter conditions concerning the site and/or the duration of the demonstration could have been perceived as excessive restrictions in this respect the ecj stated as follows whilst the competent national authorities must endeavour to limit as far as possible the inevitable effects upon free movement of a demonstration on the public highway they must balance that interest with that of the demonstrators who seek to draw the aims of their action to the attention of the public an action of that type usually entails inconvenience for non-participants in particular as regards free movement but the inconvenience may in principle be tolerated provided that the objective pursued is essentially the public and lawful demonstration of an opinion in that regard the republic of austria submits without being contradicted on that point that in any event all the alternative solutions which could be countenanced would have risked reactions which would have been difficult to control and would have been liable to cause much more serious disruption to intra-community trade and public order such as unauthorised demonstrations confrontation between supporters and opponents of the group organising the demonstration or acts of violence on the part of the demonstrators who considered that the exercise of their fundamental rights had been infringed. the ecj concluded that the fact that the authorities of a member state did not ban a demonstration in circumstances such as those of the main case was not incompatible with articles and of the ec treaty read together with article thereof article of council regulation ec no of december on the functioning of the internal market in relation to the free movement of goods among the member states reads as follows this regulation may not be interpreted as affecting in any way the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in member states including the right or freedom to strike these rights may also include the right or freedom to take other actions covered by the specific industrial relations systems in member states. the court has examined the regulations concerning the use of vehicles to obstruct traffic in the context of public demonstrations in thirty-five council of europe member states namely albania austria azerbaijan belgium bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia cyprus the czech republic estonia finland france georgia germany greece hungary ireland italy latvia liechtenstein luxembourg the republic of moldova montenegro poland portugal romania russia serbia slovakia slovenia switzerland the former yugoslav republic of macedonia turkey ukraine and the united kingdom this comparative-law survey shows that while the use of vehicles in public demonstrations is generally not specifically regulated in the laws of the member states obstruction of traffic on the public highway by vehicles or by other means is criminally punishable in the following ten countries azerbaijan belgium france greece ireland italy portugal romania turkey and the united kingdom in the event of conviction the guilty person may be sentenced to imprisonment for different terms minimum of three months in greece up to one year in italy two years in france and romania three years in azerbaijan and turkey five years in portugal ten years in belgium or to a fine ireland and the united kingdom a number of countries provide for criminal sanctions including imprisonment in qualified situations where the obstruction of traffic entails grave consequences such as damage to property or to the life and physical integrity of persons for example the czech republic georgia hungary the republic of moldova russia switzerland the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and ukraine or if it involves certain examples of reprehensible conduct such as the use of threats or violence estonia and slovakia a breach of the legal requirements for assembly cyprus or the disobeying or resisting of police orders austria in germany in particular there is established case-law of the courts applying the offence of duress to the blocking of streets by vehicles in the context of public demonstrations non-criminal sanctions for obstructing traffic in breach of road-safety provisions or rules governing public assembly are provided for in the laws of bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria croatia estonia finland latvia luxembourg the republic of moldova poland russia serbia slovakia and

the case of le compte van leuven and de meyere was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission and the government of the the government the case originated in two applications against that state lodged with the commission in and by three belgian nationals dr. herman le compte dr. frans van leuven and dr. marc de meyere under article art of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention the commission ordered the joinder of the applications on march both the commission s request and the government s application were lodged with the registry of the court within the period of three months laid down by articles par and art art the former on march and the latter on april the request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration made by the recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the application referred to article art the purpose of the request and the application is to obtain a decision from the court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and art art mr. w. ganshof van der meersch the elected judge of belgian nationality was called upon to sit as an ex officio member of the chamber of seven judges to be constituted article of the convention art however by letter dated march he declared that he withdrew pursuant to rule par of the rules of court on april the government appointed as ad hoc judge mr. a. vanwelkenhuyzen professor at the free university of brussels article of the convention and rule par art on april mr. g. balladore pallieri the president of the court and an ex officio member of the chamber rule par b drew by lot in the presence of the registrar the names of the five other members namely mr. g. wiarda mr. r. ryssdal sir gerald fitzmaurice mrs. d. bindschedler-robert and mr. l. liesch article in fine of the convention and rule par art mr. balladore pallieri assumed the office of president of the chamber rule par he ascertained through the registrar the views of the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission regarding the procedure to be followed on may he decided that the agent should have until august to file a memorial and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months from the date of the transmission of the government s memorial to them by the registrar the government s memorial was received at the registry on august on october the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegates would reply thereto at the hearings he also transmitted to the registrar the observations of the applicants lawyer on the commission s report on october the chamber decided under rule to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary court after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission the president of the court directed on october that the oral proceedings should open on november the oral hearings were held in public at the on november mr. wiarda then vice-president of the court presided as mr. balladore pallieri was unable to attend the court had held a preparatory meeting immediately before the hearings opened sir vincent evans the judge elected on september to replace sir gerald fitzmaurice sat in the latter s stead rule par of the rules of court there appeared before the court for the government for the commission the court heard addresses by mr. nelissen grade for the government and by mr. sperduti mr. melchior and mr. bultinck for the commission as well as their replies to questions put by the court it requested those appearing to produce various documents these were supplied by the commission on november and january dr. herman le compte a belgian national born in and resident at knokke-heist is a medical practitioner on october the west flanders provincial council of the ordre des médecins medical association which sits in ordered that dr le compte s right to practise medicine be suspended for six weeks the ground was that he had given to a belgian newspaper an interview considered by the council to amount to publicity incompatible with the dignity and reputation of the profession the applicant lodged an objection opposition against this decision which had been given in absentia but it was confirmed by the provincial council on december the applicant again having failed to appear le compte thereupon referred the matter firstly to the appeals council of the ordre des médecins which on may held his appeal to be inadmissible and secondly to the court of cassation on april the latter declared his appeal on a point of law inadmissible on the ground that it had been filed without the assistance of a lawyer entitled to practise before that court the order suspending dr le compte s right to practise became effective on may but he did not comply with it for this reason on february the furnes criminal court tribunal correctionnel sentenced him pursuant to article of royal decree no of november on the ordre des médecins to imprisonment and a fine this decision was confirmed on september by the ghent court of appeal a appeal by dr le compte on a point of law was dismissed by the court of cassation on june concurrently with the foregoing proceedings which are not in issue in the present case see paragraph below further proceedings were in progress in fact on june the provincial council of the ordre des médecins had by a decision rendered in absentia ordered another suspension for three months of the applicant s right to practise the council stated that he had publicised in the press the above-mentioned decisions of the disciplinary organs of the ordre and his criticisms of those organs such conduct constituting contempt of the ordre dr le compte had appealed to the appeals council of the ordre which had confirmed this decision although without upholding the allegation of contempt he had then referred the matter to the court of cassation where he relied on the same grounds he contended in the first place that compulsory membership of the ordre des médecins without which no one may practise medicine and subjection to the jurisdiction of its disciplinary organs were contrary to the principle of freedom of association which is guaranteed by article of the belgian constitution and article art of the convention the court rejected this plea in the following terms compulsory entry on the register of an ordre which like the ordre des médecins is a public-law institution having the function of ensuring the observance of the medical profession s rules of professional conduct and the maintenance of the reputation standards of discretion probity and dignity of its members can not be regarded as incompatible with freedom of association as guaranteed by article of the constitution the appellant does not allege that the rule which he is challenging goes beyond the bounds of the restrictions authorised by article par art of the convention for example for the protection of health the applicant also alleged a violation of articles and of the constitution the first provides that the courts of law shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes over civil rights and the second prohibits the establishment of extraordinary tribunals for the purpose of resolving such disputes he pointed out that the decision complained of had nonetheless been taken by a disciplinary organ set up by royal decree no and that it had given a ruling on a civil right namely the right to practise medicine the court of cassation replied that disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions are in principle unrelated to the disputes over which exclusive jurisdiction is reserved to the courts of law by article of the constitution the court added that since the councils of the ordre des médecins did not have jurisdiction to determine such disputes they are not extraordinary tribunals whose establishment is prohibited by article finally the court observed that section par a of the act of march see paragraph below empowered the crown to reform and adapt the legislation governing the practice of the various branches of medicine and that the legislature was referring inter alia to the act of july establishing the ordre des médecins which act conferred disciplinary powers on the councils of the ordre lastly dr le compte alleged that there had been a violation of article par art of the convention he argued that the decision complained of had been given without any public inquiry and by a tribunal composed of medical practitioners which could not be regarded as impartial since the kind of conduct of which he was accused might harm his colleagues the court of cassation confined itself to pointing out that article par art did not apply to disciplinary proceedings accordingly by judgment of may the appeal was dismissed dr le compte did not comply with the order suspending his right to practise medicine which became final following the court of cassation s judgment on that account he was sentenced by the criminal court on september and october to terms of imprisonment and fines he lodged an appeal against the first decision and an objection against the second which had been rendered in absentia since that time a number of further proceedings have been instituted both disciplinary for the publicity given by the applicant to his dispute with the ordre and criminal for his refusal to comply with the measures imposed by its councils one of the disciplinary proceedings resulted in dr le compte s being struck off the register of the ordre with effect from december in this connection he lodged a further application no with the commission on may that application which the commission declared admissible on december is not relevant for the examination of the present case the criminal proceedings at first instance led to prison sentences and to fines dr. frans van leuven and dr. marc de meyere are medical practitioners born in and respectively both of them reside at merelbeke and are belgian nationals on january thirteen medical practitioners practising in and around merelbeke filed a complaint to the effect that these two applicants had committed breaches of the rules of professional conduct it was alleged in particular that they had systematically limited their fees to the amounts reimbursed by the social security even when on emergency duty and had distributed without charge to private houses a fortnightly magazine called gezond in which general practitioners were held up to ridicule on march the applicants were heard by the bureau of the provincial council of the ordre they admitted that they had limited the fees charged to their own clients but not the fees charged when they were on emergency duty in addition they pointed out that they were not the publishers of gezond and they denied that they had lampooned their colleagues in its pages on march another medical practitioner lodged a further complaint against the applicants he alleged that two days after their appearance before the bureau of the provincial council they had put up in the waiting rooms of the merelbeke medical centre a notice informing the public of the first complaint and the reasons therefore on may the bureau of the provincial council heard the applicants in connection with the second complaint they declared that they were entitled to provide the public with information about the situation especially as it was already a matter of common knowledge the east flanders provincial council of the ordre des médecins which sits in summoned dr. van leuven and dr. de meyere to answer several allegations on october it directed that their right to practise medicine be suspended for a period of one month for having charged fees limited to the amounts reimbursed by the social security for having contributed to the magazine gezond and for having made therein public utterances judged offensive to their colleagues in addition dr. van leuven was reprimanded for his behaviour when appearing before the bureau of the provincial council on march these various decisions were based on articles par and of royal decree no the provincial council considered on the other hand that the posting in the waiting rooms of the medical centre of a notice judged contrary to the rules of professional conduct did not warrant a disciplinary sanction bearing in mind that the notice had been removed following a request from the bureau the applicants appealed to the appeals council on june the latter declared the appeal admissible and upheld the provincial council s decision insofar as it had found established the allegations relating to the charging of fees limited to the amounts reimbursed by the social security and the contribution to the magazine gezond for the rest the appeals council set aside the decision challenged and after taking into account the complaint regarding the notice in the waiting rooms and joining it with the two other complaints directed that the right of dr. van leuven and dr. de meyere to practise medicine be suspended for a period of fifteen days on april the court of cassation ruled against the applicants who had appealed on a point of law the court rejected the ground of appeal based on breach of article art of the convention it considered that the functions of the ordre des médecins are by no means unrelated to the protection of health and that compulsory entry on the register of an ordre of this kind does not exceed the restrictions on freedom of association which are necessary for the protection of health the court in addition declared inadmissible for want of legal interest the ground of appeal to the effect that the limitation of fees to the amounts reimbursed by the social security was in conformity with both the law and the rules of professional conduct for medical practitioners the court found that the suspension had in fact also been imposed as a sanction for other disciplinary offences the ordre des médecins which was established by an act of july was re-organised by royal decree no of november this decree was made under the act of march investing the king with certain powers with a view to ensuring economic revival acceleration of regional reconversion and a stable balanced budget the act enabled the crown acting by decrees in council to take all appropriate steps to further the quality and ensure satisfactory provision of health care through reform and adaptation of the legislation governing the practice of the various branches of medicine section par a it specified that such decrees could repeal supplement amend or replace existing legal provisions section article of royal decree no provides that the ordre des médecins shall include all physicians surgeons and obstetricians who are permanently resident in belgium and entered on the register of the ordre for the province where they have their permanent residence and that in order to practise medicine in belgium every medical practitioner whether belgian or foreign must be entered on the register of the ordre military doctors however are only obliged to be entered on the register if they practise outside their military duties alongside the ordre des médecins there exist in private associations formed to protect the professional interests of medical practitioners the most important of these associations are consulted and invited to take part in collective negotiations when the government are considering the adoption of decisions affecting those interests to propose candidates for nomination as members of certain organs and to appoint their representatives on others and to take various measures themselves the ordre des médecins shall enjoy civil personality in public law article third paragraph of royal decree no it comprises three kinds of organs namely provincial councils appeals councils and the national council the provincial councils of which there are ten consist of a number which is always even and is fixed by the crown of members and substitute members who are medical practitioners of belgian nationality elected for six years by doctors entered on the register of the ordre there are also an assessor and a substitute assessor who are judges of first instance courts appointed for six years by the crown the assessor has a consultative status articles and par of royal decree no the council s functions are defined by article of royal decree no in the following terms to keep the register of the ordre they may refuse or defer entry on the register if the person applying has been guilty either of an act of such seriousness as would cause the name of a member of the ordre to be struck off the register or of serious misconduct damaging the reputation or dignity of the profession if the medical commission has decided and notified the ordre that a medical practitioner no longer fulfils the conditions required for practising medicine or that it is necessary for reasons of physical or mental disability to place a restriction on the practise by him of medicine the relevant provincial council shall in the first case remove the practitioner s name from the register and in the second case make the maintenance of his name thereon subject to observance of the restriction ordered a practitioner s name may also be removed from the register at his own request reasons must be given for any decision refusing or deferring entry on the register removing a practitioner s name therefrom or making its maintenance thereon subject to restrictive conditions to ensure observance of the rules of professional conduct for medical practitioners and the upholding of the reputation standards of discretion probity and dignity of the members of the ordre they shall to this end be responsible for disciplining misconduct committed by their registered members in or in connection with the practice of the profession and serious misconduct committed outside the realm of professional activity whenever such misconduct is liable to damage the reputation or dignity of the profession to give of their own motion or on request the members of the ordre advice on matters of professional conduct such advice shall be submitted to the national council for approval to notify the relevant authorities of any acts involving illegal practice of medicine of which the councils have knowledge to act at the joint request of those concerned as final arbitrator in disputes regarding the fees claimed by a medical practitioner from his client to reply to all requests for advice emanating from courts of law in connection with disputes as to fees to settle the annual subscription including the amount fixed by the national council for each registered member the provincial councils are distinct from the medical commissions which have been set up outside the ordre in each province and are composed in addition to medical and pharmaceutical practitioners of members of the paramedical professions and of officials of the ministry of public health article of royal decree no these commissions have two functions the first is general and consists of proposing to the authorities any measures designed to make a contribution to public health and of ensuring that practitioners and members of the paramedical professions collaborate effectively in the implementation of the measures laid down by the authorities for the purpose of preventing or combating diseases subject to quarantine or communicable diseases the second specific function comprises various responsibilities checking and approving practitioners diplomas withdrawing approval or making its continuance in force subject to the acceptance by the person concerned of certain restrictions ensuring that the practice of medicine is conducted in accordance with the laws and regulations detecting and reporting to the prosecuting authority cases of illegal practice assessing the demand for emergency services and supervising their operation informing interested parties whether acting in public or private capacity of decisions taken as regards a practitioner s exercise of his profession advising the organs of the ordres concerned of allegations of professional misconduct against practitioners supervising public sales where medicines are involved article the two appeals councils one of which uses the french and the other the dutch language have their seat in the greater brussels area they are each composed of ten medical practitioners of belgian nationality five members and five substitute members elected for six years by the provincial councils from among persons other than their own members and ten court of appeal judges five members and five substitute members appointed by the crown for the same length of time from among these judges the crown designates the chairman who has a casting vote and the member who is to act as rapporteur article par and of royal decree no the appeals councils hear appeals from decisions given by the provincial councils on matters of registration or discipline they deal as the body of first and final instance with claims concerning the regularity of elections to the provincial councils the appeals councils and the national council they also decide cases on which the provincial councils have not given a ruling within the prescribed time-limit finally they settle any dispute between provincial councils regarding a practitioner s place of permanent residence article the national council comprises twenty persons ten members and ten substitute members of belgian nationality who are respectively elected by each of the provincial councils from among medical practitioners entered on its register and twelve persons six members and six substitute members appointed by the crown from among medical practitioners nominated in lists of three candidates by the medical faculties in the country the national council is presided over by a judge of the court of cassation chosen by the crown and consists of two sections one french-speaking the other dutch-speaking each of which elects from among its number a vice-president article the national council formulates those general principles and those rules concerning the morality reputation standards of discretion probity and devotion to duty essential for practice of the profession which constitute the code of professional conduct for medical practitioners these principles and rules may be made compulsory by royal decrees in council a draft code failed to receive royal approval it keeps up to date a list of those disciplinary decisions given by the provincial and appeals councils which are no longer open to appeal it gives reasoned opinions on general matters on problems of principle and on the rules of professional conduct it settles the amount of the subscription medical practitioners are asked to pay to the ordre more generally it takes all steps necessary for the achievement of the aims of the ordre article in the procedure relating to disciplinary and registration matters which is primarily governed by the royal decree of february regulating the organisation and working of the councils of the ordre des médecins the contending parties are always heard there may be three stages a ruling at first instance by the provincial council a ruling at final instance by the appeals council and a review by the court of cassation of the legality of the decisions and the observance of formal requirements the procedure begins before the provincial council which acts either on its own initiative or at the request of the national council the minister responsible for public health the procureur du roi or the medical commission or on complaint by a medical practitioner or a third party article par first sub-paragraph of royal decree no the procedure continues before the appeals council if it has been seised either by the practitioner concerned or by the provincial council s assessor or by the president of the national council acting jointly with one of the vice-presidents an appeal has suspensive effect article investigation of the matter necessarily involves the participation of a member of the judiciary before the provincial council for the purposes of the initial investigation this will be the assessor before the appeals council for the purposes if need be of a supplementary investigation it will be the council member acting as rapporteur see paragraphs and above furthermore the provincial council member who acted as rapporteur may always be heard by the appeals council articles par par and of royal decree no before the provincial and appeals councils the proceedings are conducted in private article par sub-paragraph of royal decree no and article of the royal decree of february the medical practitioner concerned has the right to be informed as soon as possible of the

consulted the agent of the greek government the government the applicant monasteries lawyers and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the proceedings rules para and pursuant to the order made in consequence the registrar received the government s memorial on october and the applicant monasteries memorial on november on the latter date the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would submit his observations at the hearing in accordance with the president s decision the hearing took place in public in the human rights building on january the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant monasteries the court heard addresses by them and also their replies to its questions the applicant monasteries which were founded between the ninth and thirteenth centuries accumulated a considerable amount of property in particular through donations made before the creation of the in but a large part of this property was expropriated during the early years of the state s existence the monasteries themselves also gave away whole tracts of land to the state or to individuals who had none during the byzantine and ottoman empires the monasteries and religious institutions in general were almost the only institutions discharging important social cultural and educational functions even in the nineteenth century after the creation of the they still discharged some of these functions the state never challenged their ownership and the monasteries always relied on adverse possession as a subsidiary means of establishing it particularly in cases where byzantine or ottoman title deeds were lacking or had been destroyed on several occasions the state published decrees in the official gazette in which their ownership was acknowledged decrees of january and march june and august etc. apart from property thus amassed over the centuries the monasteries acquired numerous plots of land and buildings more recently either as gifts or legacies or through purchase under law no their land and buildings were classified as either property to be realised ekpiitea perioussia or property to be retained diatiritea perioussia the second category included property considered necessary for the needs of a given monastery having regard inter alia to the number of its members and to its historic value as a place of pilgrimage and they were listed in a decree adopted on a proposal by the minister for education and religious affairs responsibility for managing the property to be retained was vested in the holy monasteries and its exercise was governed by a decree of march this provided among other things that the revenue arising from this management was to be applied to making good the monasteries deficit repairing and maintaining buildings and furthering educational and charitable purposes responsibility for managing the property to be realised was vested in the office for the management of church property organismos diikisis ekklisiastikis perioussias the constitution authorised the government to expropriate land for the benefit of destitute farmers and stockbreeders for a period of three years from its entry into force in pursuance of this transitional provision article the greek orthodox church and the state concluded an agreement which was ratified by the state in a decree no of october article para of that decree stated in substance that the state would from then on waive its rights under article of the constitution relating to expropriation or compulsory leasing of property of the greek church by the agreement which covered the purchase by the state of greek orthodox church land for the purposes of restoring it to destitute farmers and stockbreeders the church and the monasteries would transfer to the state four-fifths of their agricultural land and two-thirds of their pastures and would receive in return a third of the real value of that property annexed were lists giving the type location and area of the land thus sold to the state and of that kept by the monasteries under article a agricultural land and pastures that were part of the property to be retained of the monasteries of agia lavra and mega spileo kalavriton were not covered by the agreement the office for the management of church property the odep a public-law entity under the supervision of the ministry of education and religious affairs was set up by law no and replaced the general ecclesiastical fund that had existed since in section of the law it was made responsible for the management of all the movable and immovable property belonging to the holy monasteries but responsibility for the property to be retained was taken away from it after a time the odep s function as laid down in section was to realise the monasteries property to manage ecclesiastical property other than that belonging to the churches and to make use of the revenues the odep was run by a board of governors whose members originally included the archbishop of athens two senior church dignitaries a senior member of the a legal adviser the head of the treasury a representative of the bank of greece and a representative of a commercial bank decree no reduced the number of members to seven three of whom were laymen appointed by the ministry of education and religious affairs under regulations issued in which are still in force the number of lay members was increased to four by regulation the odep s revenue had to be applied to church purposes in particular the financing of missionary and educational events and the remuneration of certain members of the clergy the ties binding the hellenic nation and later the to the orthodox church go back several centuries the interdependence of state and church was already apparent in the administrative reorganisation of the church which followed the restructuring of the the church s historical role grew more important after the collapse of the byzantine empire the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople was recognised as millet basi the spiritual leader at the same time answerable to the sublime porte of the orthodox community which became integrated into the administrative machinery of the ottoman empire through the church the greek orthodox church was proclaimed to be autocephalous in a royal decree of july and was at the same time given its first charter which was very noticeably imbued with the spirit of state control the church was independent of the state only in matters of doctrine article of the constitution of june in its references to the patriarchal tome of and the synodical act of on the one hand and to the holy synod of the hierarchy synod of serving metropolitans as the supreme church authority on the other evidences the intention of breaking with the old tradition of state control the proclaimed independence of the church is not however unlimited as is shown by the fact that the greek orthodox church is the church of the dominant religion and embodies the religion of the state itself the law of may law no on the charter of the greek church also provides for interdependence of church and state section attributes to the church and a number of its institutions including the monasteries legal personality in public law as regards their legal relations under section the church is to co-operate with the state in fields of common interest such as the christian upbringing of young people enhancing the status of the institution of marriage and of the family caring for those in need of protection and safeguarding sacred relics and ecclesiastical monuments the church s role in public life is reflected more markedly by the presence of the minister for education and religious affairs at the sessions held to elect the archbishop of athens and by the participation of the church authorities in all official state events the provisions on the church s finances and staffing testify even more eloquently to this interdependence as to financing the law provides that the state is to contribute to the church s expenses section that the church s resources are to be managed in a manner determined by decision of the standing holy synod approved by the holy synod of the hierarchy section and that managerial acts are subject to the state s financial supervision section as to staffing the provisions governing public servants are to apply by analogy to the staff of church public-law entities section of the law describes the holy monasteries as ascetic religious institutions whose members live according to monastic principles the sacred rules of asceticism and the traditions of the christian orthodox church the holy monasteries come under the spiritual supervision of the local archbishop section the organisation and furtherance of spiritual life within the monasteries and the running of them are the responsibility of the monastic councils and conform to the holy rules and monastic traditions section the holy monasteries are public-law entities section they may be founded merged or dissolved by means of a presidential decree adopted on a proposal by the minister for education and religious affairs after consultation of the local archbishop and with the approval of the standing holy synod section the decisions of the monastery councils are preparatory in nature taking effect only after they have been ratified by the higher church authority judicial review lies only against the decisions of the latter authority the holy synod of the hierarchy the supreme church authority has power to regulate the internal organisation and administration of the church and the monasteries it scrutinises the decisions of the standing holy synod of the archbishops and of the other church legal entities including the monasteries section e and g over which the state exercises no authority the

grd million law no was published in the official gazette of may and changed the rules on the management and representation of monastery property within the charge of the odep most of whose members were now to be appointed by the state it also provided that within six months of its publication the state would become the owner of all monastery property unless the monasteries proved title kyriotita established either by a duly registered deed metegrammeno or by a statutory provision or by a final court decision against the state in this connection it should be noted that only real-property transactions concluded since have had to be registered section of the law of october on the registration of immovable property and of rights in rem relating thereto similarly the civil code has required legacies and inheritances to be registered only since except in the dodecanese does not have any official land survey the factors which prompted the state to enact new rules on church property are set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill the following passages should be noted this bill deals with the question of the immovable property in the church s possession today a question that since the beginning of the has caused friction not only between state and church but also between the latter and the people under the present system many national treasures remain unexploited the church s current possessions are largely the remnants of a period in which the church s existence was dependent solely on its own property and even on its own labour since then its operating conditions have radically changed the state covers nearly all its needs concurrently with the provisions of this bill provision is being made for the first time for subsidies from the state budget to the holy monasteries and the church in general so that they may expand their spiritual mission which is so necessary for the nation and for the orthodox faith in and abroad a large part of this immovable property has been wasted in unlawful and disadvantageous transactions or usurped by skilful exploiters while the rest has largely been abandoned or is being utilised detrimentally by third parties this national heritage is continually shrinking and tending to disappear as a productive source of wealth for the country s agriculture stockbreeding and forestry furthermore most of the lands now in the church s possession belong to the state they are occupied without legal title and with the state s toleration this national property is constantly being diminished by illegal sales and encroachments which lead to usurpations of land and uncontrolled development this is a situation which undermines the church s authority it should be remembered that since the state has legislated to make the transfer of four-fifths of the monasteries property to the state compulsory for the benefit of those who do not have any land decree no this statutory obligation has not hitherto been enforced the following provisions are relevant section as soon as this law enters into force the office for the management of church property the odep shall automatically be vested with the exclusive management and representation of all the immovable property of the holy monasteries in respect of which it shall henceforth have full power to take or defend legal proceedings whether the property belongs under the legislation in force to the category of ‘ property to be retained or to that of ‘ property to be realised t he conditions and procedures

monasteries or of the granting of any right in rem relating to it the consent of the monastery concerned shall be required failing which the contract shall be null and void section a right of user

validity of any grant of a right of user made in accordance with the conditions set out in the preceding subsection except for the required payment of a percentage of the revenue which shall be paid to the entity provided for in section of this law and shall be used for educational purposes until this entity is created the percentage shall be paid to a special account at the bank of greece in the

provisions immovable property in use nomi by or the possession katokhi of the holy monasteries when this law comes into force shall be deemed to be the property of the greek state irrespective of the manner in which it is managed or utilised unless a monastery s ownership a derives from a title deed that antedates the day on which the bill was tabled and has already been registered or will be registered within a strict time-limit of six months from the entry into force of this law or b has been recognised in a statutory provision or in a final court decision against the state the same shall apply to buildings which belong to the monasteries or are in their possession but are occupied by third parties the holy monasteries and third parties use and possession of immovable property deemed to belong to the state in accordance with the preceding subsection and ownership of which has not passed to the state under section shall be terminated and be transferred automatically to the greek state all forms of management or utilisation of these buildings shall cease irrespective of the category to which the property belongs under the current legislation from that date the state shall exercise the rights associated with the ownership use and possession of the property vis-à-vis third parties the holy monasteries and bodies responsible for managing those monasteries property the minister of agriculture shall henceforth manage this property in accordance with the provisions of the legislation already in force and of this law this change shall not affect the validity of any

natural person in possession of one of the buildings deemed to belong to the state must transfer it to the head of the appropriate agriculture or forestry department failing which the latter will make an administrative eviction order enforceable within fifteen days of its being served the evicted person may apply for judicial review of such an order but this will not have any suspensive effect subsection furthermore it is open to such a person if he asserts rights in rem over the building to apply to the civil courts under articles of the civil code subsection the arrangements for implementing sections and are to be specified in a presidential decree to be adopted on a proposal by the minister for education and religious affairs the minister for the economy and the minister of agriculture to the court s knowledge this has still not been issued section provides that the odep s governing body shall be composed of a chairman and a vice-chairman appointed by the cabinet on a proposal by the minister for education and religious affairs and six other members and their substitutes half of whom are to be appointed by the standing holy synod and half by the minister for education and religious affairs section provides for the creation on a proposal by the minister for education and religious affairs and the minister for the economy of a private-law entity to be responsible for implementing educational programmes to be established by the ministry of education and religious affairs section provides for the inclusion in the state budget of an appropriation to support and maintain the monasteries and strengthen the church s cultural work the minister for education and religious affairs is to allocate the available funds with a view to implementing a special programme that he will draw up each year on a recommendation by the standing holy synod law no provides that it is not to apply to property of the holy monasteries which come under the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople or the patriarchates of alexandria antioch and or under the holy sepulchre or the holy monastery of sinai the chairman and the other members of the odep s governing body were appointed by the minister for education and religious affairs on and july pursuant to section of law no on july the greek church challenged the lawfulness of their appointment in the symvoulio tis epikratias by means of an application for judicial review coupled with an application for a stay of execution on august the supreme administrative court s committee for hearing applications for stays of execution held that any attempt by the odep s new governing body to exercise the powers conferred on it by law no would be likely to compromise relations between church and state it consequently allowed the application and stayed the decisions until the supreme administrative court had ruled on the merits on september some of the monasteries including three of the applicant monasteries and their archimandrites also appealed against the decisions alleging among other things that law no infringed the greek constitution articles para para and and the european convention the supreme administrative court gave its ruling on december judgment no stating the provisions of article para of the constitution safeguard the holy canons and traditions of the orthodox church however this constitutional protection can not be regarded as extending to the canons and traditions relating to purely administrative matters such matters which are affected by the passing of time and the advent of new ideas necessarily lend themselves to changes designed to promote the common interests of church and state the ordinary legislature regulates them according to society s needs in accordance with article para of the greek constitution it can not however by means of the church s charter or other statutory provisions undertake a radical reform of the basic administrative institutions which have long been solidly established in the orthodox church furthermore the same provisions also guarantee the church s autonomy which includes the power to determine its own affairs through its own organs composed as provided for by law and to be governed by the holy synod of the hierarchy and the standing holy synod constituted in accordance with the law and the provisions of the patriarchal tome of june and the synodical act of september concerning the composition of these bodies in the view of the majority of this court the provisions of law no which vests the management and representation of the holy monasteries property in the odep a public-law entity integrated into the administrative framework of the church and a majority of whose board of governors members are appointed by the state are not incompatible with the church s autonomy guaranteed by the constitution or with freedom of religion or with articles and of the rome convention or with the charter of the united nations or with the final act of helsinki as these matters unconnected with doctrine or worship are purely administrative and unrelated to the church s basic administrative institutions consequently they must be freely regulated by the ordinary legislature furthermore the provisions of law no do not materially affect those institutions as the management of monastery and church property had always been vested in the odep whose board of governors as constituted under law no was composed for the greater part of lay members appointed by the state the grounds of nullity are accordingly ill-founded and must be rejected however one of the senior members of the court has expressed the following opinion in which he is joined by one of the junior members paredri article of the constitution which provides that the greek church is to be governed by ‘ the synod of serving metropolitans safeguards not only the church s autonomy in the sense that it is governed by metropolitans elected by it but also the right to manage and dispose of at its discretion the movable and immovable property of every kind belonging to it in order to achieve its non-profit-making aims namely the establishment and promotion of the orthodox faith of its members monastic life in monastic communities which are vital parts of that church and which despite their status as public-law entities derive like the church itself from an area lying outside the jurisdiction of the state has always constituted a fundamental mode of the worship of god to deprive all the monasteries of the management and representation of all their existing and future property and to assign those powers to the odep without their consent is consequently an unacceptable restriction of their autonomy and of that of the church these provisions entail in the first place a breach of the aforementioned article of the constitution which does not allow the church s administrative institutions to be altered to the point of removing its autonomy and secondly seriously hamper the practice of worship through monastic life since they prevent the ‘ unrestricted practice of monastic worship as secured in article para of the constitution lastly it must be pointed out that from the odep was run by a board of governors a majority of whose members were appointed by the church and which was chaired by the archbishop of athens the precedents to the contrary cited by the majority relate to isolated special cases and not to the monasteries property as a whole the minority consequently consider the grounds of nullity to be well-founded the applicants also maintained that the provisions of law no which vested the management and representation of the monasteries property in the odep an entity separate from the church and not controlled by it and authorised the transfer of that property to the state without any compensation were contrary to articles and para a of the constitution as they made mandatory provision for an unacceptable transfer of that property deprived the holy monasteries of their ownership and introduced unconstitutional restrictions on property rights article para a of the constitution prohibits any general confiscation article provides that ownership is under the protection of the state but that rights deriving from it can not be exercised to the detriment of the public interest no one may be deprived of his property unless in the public interest duly made out in the eventualities and according to the procedure laid down by law and in every case subject to full prior compensation this latter provision of the constitution prohibits any deprivation of property that does not satisfy the foregoing conditions nothing however prevents the legislature from restricting the right of ownership on the basis of objective criteria and in the public interest on condition that such restrictions do not nullify the right and make it ineffective in the view of the majority of the court the provisions of law no which provide for the transfer to the greek state of the ownership of the monasteries agricultural land and of other immovable property owned by the holy monasteries without any title deed are not contrary to article of the constitution as they do not deprive the holy monasteries of their ownership idioktissia the law in fact means that this immovable property does not belong to them moreover the provisions of the law concerning the sale of the holy monasteries urban immovable property or the granting of rights in rem relating to it by decision of the odep do not infringe the holy monasteries right of ownership inasmuch as their implementation is subject to the agreement of the holy monastery which owns the immovable property failing which the contract is void lastly the provisions relating to the utilisation by the odep of urban immovable property and mines quarries and fish farms belonging to the holy monasteries or any other church institution and those relating to the management and representation of agricultural property and the present or future utilisation of urban immovable property do not entail any deprivation of ownership since the ownership as such remains in the hands of the holy monasteries and in any case the revenue from the odep s management of this property is used for ecclesiastical purposes the provisions lay down constitutional restrictions on ownership which are designed to serve at one and the same time the monasteries interest and the public interest in consequence this ground of nullity together with the complaints relating to article paras and and article para of the constitution and article of the paris protocol of march are ill-founded and must be rejected two senior members of the court joined by one of the junior members have expressed the following opinion transferring the management and representation of the whole of the monasteries property to the odep on the aforementioned terms even ‘ as an amendment to the legal provisions in force section of law no does not amount to a restriction of ownership which is allowed by the constitution but interferes unacceptably and without full compensation with the very essence of the right of ownership this is all the more evident as the only possibility left open to the monasteries is either to consent or to object to the sale of their urban property or the granting of a right in rem relating to it by the odep without being able to decide the matter for themselves such a decision belongs exclusively to the odep which has unfettered discretion to determine without even consulting the monasteries the sale of agricultural land and ‘ the present and future utilisation of their immovable property such as is provided for in section of law no as to the monasteries movable property some of which is extremely valuable icons in monastery museums precious relics shares etc they are managed by the odep without any restrictions whatever furthermore it should be noted that law no does not specify how the income from monastic property is to be applied on the other hand it appears from sections b and of law no that the state s revenue from the ‘ utilisation or granting of the use of monastic and church property is to be transferred to a private-law entity set up under section which does not have any ecclesiastical objectives the provisions of law no are thus wholly contrary not only to article of the constitution but also to the provisions of the rome convention article of the protocol and the treaty establishing the european economic community and they engage the greek state s international responsibility consequently the minority consider this ground of nullity to be well-founded as to the submission that the provisions of law no infringe article para of the constitution because they establish discrimination between the greek orthodox church and the monasteries coming under the ecumenical patriarchate the ecumenical patriarchate itself the patriarchates of alexandria jerusalem the holy sepulchre and the holy monastery of sinai and the monasteries of other denominations or religions the complaint is ill-founded since the greek orthodox church as an instrument and expression of the dominant religion according to the terms of article para of the constitution does not occupy the same position as the other orthodox churches and other denominations or religions such that the statutory provisions in issue do not offend the constitutional principle of equal treatment of comparable legal situations moreover it is alleged that the provisions of law no infringe article para of the constitution in that orthodox citizens who wish to support the monasteries financially are impeded in their self-fulfilment since contrary to their wishes the management of donations would vest not in the monasteries but in the odep furthermore it is submitted that these provisions infringe the individual freedom of religion of the members of monastic communities and of those who would like to found a monastery by dedicating their assets to that end the first limb of the ground is ill-founded since the individual right of free self-fulfilment secured in article para of the constitution is not an absolute right it is subject to the restrictions laid down in the constitution and in law in the instant case the restrictions deriving from the aforementioned provisions of law no do not infringe article para of the constitution the ground is also ill-founded in its second limb since it refers vaguely to possible damage sustained by the applicants in the future the nevertheless quashed the minister for education and religious affairs decision of july see paragraph above on the ground that the composition of the odep s governing body did not satisfy the requirements of section of law no the passing of law no had produced a sharp reaction from the greek church with a view to calming the situation the government and the holy synod of the hierarchy held a series of meetings and concluded a preliminary accord under which the monasteries would by means of a further agreement transfer part of their property to the state an essential condition of the preliminary accord was that the greek church would have to seek from each monastery council full powers to sign the further agreement on may the standing holy synod duly concluded a further agreement with the state whereby monasteries including the applicant monasteries of asomaton petraki ossios loukas and phlamourion volou transferred their agricultural and forest property to the state monasteries declared that they were not affected by the agreement since they did not have any substantial property of that kind parliament ratified the agreement in section of law no section of which provided on publication of this law the management of the urban property of the holy monasteries that are not parties to the agreement shall revert to the standing holy synod of the greek church the provisions of law no shall apply to the remainder of these monasteries property section provided that monasteries which were not parties to the agreement could join it within a renewable period of one year from the commencement of the law the operation of law no was not however suspended during that period under clause of the agreement the monasteries parties to it are to cede to the state all their agricultural and forest property except for the land surrounding them within a radius of metres a monastery s opinion must be sought before any leisure facilities restaurants or business are established in its vicinity and operated furthermore the monasteries are authorised to retain a proportion of their original real property provided that the total area of land retained does not exceed sq m of forest or sq m of agricultural land and of land usable for tourism purposes the greek church is allotted of land included in the town development plan after lastly land in the monasteries possession by virtue of a title deed or which has passed to them under a will or a deed of gift is exempt from transfer a special committee set up in each prefecture by a decision of the prefect is to determine which land is to be transferred to the state and which is to be kept by each monastery in exchange for the transfer of ownership the state undertakes to pay a stipend to eighty-five preachers and to spend of the budgetary appropriations earmarked for the church on financially supporting the monasteries that are parties to the agreement clause under clause of the agreement the odep was destined to be wound up once the operations had been concluded in fact the odep was dissolved after parliament s ratification of the agreement and the members of its staff were assigned to other state bodies in accordance with section of law no the management of the urban property and part of the agricultural and forest property remaining in the ownership of the monasteries parties to the agreement is to be their responsibility while the greek church having taken over the rights and obligations of the odep and having exclusive authority to act is to be responsible for the property to be realised the standing holy synod is to lay down in canonical decisions published in the official gazette the manner in which odep property transferred to the greek church on the abolition of the odep is to be managed and utilised lastly the monasteries parties to the agreement have capacity to take legal proceedings in any dispute relating to the property they retain under it clause some of the monasteries including phlamourion volou which had authorised the greek church to negotiate and sign the agreement with the state applied to the courts alleging that the agreement was null and void they argued inter alia that the agreement had been concluded by the standing holy synod a purely administrative body of the greek church with no legal personality of its own or any legal capacity the archbishops and metropolitans who had taken part in the drawing up of the agreement were not the standing holy synod s statutory representatives the tracts of land which the monasteries had undertaken to transfer were not precisely delimited and the agreement made no mention of their location area or boundaries the greek state had not acted through its statutory representative at the time that the agreement was concluded the odep was responsible for the management and representation of the monasteries property and ownership of that property had already been transferred to the state under section of law no the authorisations issued by the monasteries to the standing holy synod had not been in the form of notarial documents as required by law and the conditions that were stipulated by the monasteries for concluding the agreement and which appeared in the authorisations to act were not reproduced in the actual text of the agreement on january the athens court of first instance gave judgment against the monastery of phlamourion volou on december the athens court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the monastery against that judgment it noted in particular like the court below but in more detail that by law no the legislature had expressed the intention of ratifying the agreement in its entirety even if it contained formal or substantive defects which might have rendered it null and void under enactments in force at the time it was concluded complaint no was rejected by the court of appeal on the ground that the monastery of phlamourion volou had no locus standi since at the time the agreement was concluded it had ceased to be the owner of the land in question as for complaints nos and the court held that because of the large number of monasteries involved the agreement could only distinguish in a general way between the land to be transferred and the land to be retained and it assigned the task of laying down the precise boundaries to a committee to be set up in each prefecture furthermore the wording of clause of the agreement did not suffice on its own to show that the full powers granted to the standing holy synod had been exceeded or that there had been any misuse of powers on the part of the archbishops who had signed the agreement if that had been the case and if land not covered by the authority to act had been transferred to the state it would have amounted to a deprivation of property incompatible with article of the constitution a defect that could not have been cured by the ratification it was however impossible to determine whether the full powers had been exceeded as the appellant had not stated whether the relevant committee had already carried out its task lastly the disputed agreement was an agreement for value as the state undertook to support the monasteries that were parties to it by transferring to them of the budgetary appropriations earmarked for the church and to meet the cost of remunerating eighty-five preachers in a circular of january the ministry of agriculture requested prefectures to set up the committees provided for in clause of the agreement of may see paragraph above no action has yet been taken to this end another circular of february drew the authorities attention to the fact that ownership of the immovable property belonging to the monasteries not parties to the agreement had been transferred to the state under law no the circular also reminded the authorities of the possibility of transferring some of this property to agricultural co-operatives and of using the eviction procedure provided for in section of law no see paragraph above in practice the transfer operations and in particular the determination of which property is to pass to the state under law no and law no have not been completed in the proceedings before the commission and the court the applicant monasteries relied on several judgments whereby proceedings brought against the state by non-applicant monasteries had been stayed judgments no of the ioannina court of first instance and no of the chalcis court of first instance and an appeal by another monastery had been declared inadmissible judgment no of the lasithi court of first instance on the ground that the monasteries concerned had ceased to have locus standi once law no had come into force in particular proceedings were declared inadmissible in an action brought by a non-applicant monastery for a declaration of ownership arising according to the monastery from short adverse possession the patras court of first instance in judgment no also held that the ownership possession and use of the disputed land had automatically passed to the state under section a and b of law no and pointed out that the monastery in question was not one of those that had signed the agreement of may in a letter of february the ministry of agriculture replied as follows to a request from the agent of the government for information about the implementation of laws nos and laws nos and which regulate questions of church property have not been implemented as the procedures laid down in them for transferring to the state the land falling to it and for distinguishing that land from the land to be retained by the monasteries have not yet been carried out a problem has arisen with the management of the monasteries forest land because the proceedings whereby the state is to take possession of the land have not been set in motion and also because of disagreements between the state and the holy monasteries concerning the interpretation of the laws in question i t appears from document no of the regional development department of our ministry and from the fact that the ministry of education has set up a team to study the problem of church property that the state intends to re-examine the issue in order to resolve it counsel for the applicant monasteries stated at the hearing before the court that to date none of the land in dispute had been transferred to agricultural co-operatives or the state he maintained however that since the entry into force of law no the administrative authorities had refused to grant the authorisations necessary for carrying out certain day-to-day operations in this connection he relied on and produced correspondence between the kalambaka forestry authority on the one hand and the co-operative at vlakhava and the monastery of metamorphosis sotiros on the other the forestry authority had prevented the co-operative from cutting down trees in forests belonging to the monastery by virtue of decree no of see paragraph above although the co-operative had already in paid the monastery for the felling similarly the forestry authority of almiros in magnesia had declined to approve the four-year plan for exploiting a forest belonging to the monastery of ano xenia on the ground that there was uncertainty about the ownership of the forest the applicant monasteries applied to the commission in the following order ano xenia ossios loukas agia lavra kalavriton metamorphosis sotiros and

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr sergey vladimirovich kuznetsov the applicant on december the applicant was represented by mr yu yershov a lawyer practising in yekaterinburg the russian government the government were represented by mr p. laptev a former representative of the at the european court of human rights on march the president of the first section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article of the convention the applicant was born in and lives in yekaterinburg on march the applicant and two other persons mr sh and ms m. sent a notice to the head of yekaterinburg town administration of their intention to stage a picket in front of the the picket was to take place between and march between and a.m the declared purpose of the picket was to attract public attention to violations of the human right of access to a court on march the head of the committee for public relations and mass media of the yekaterinburg town administration acknowledged receipt of the notice he noted that should the picket cause any inconvenience such as blocking access to the court-house or impairing its normal functioning the administration would have to intervene on march the head of the yekaterinburg public security police ordered that the police should maintain public order and traffic safety during the picket on march the applicant and others held the picket they distributed press clippings and leaflets about mr ovcharuk the president of the who had allegedly been involved in corruption scandals and collected signatures for his dismissal on march mr dementyev the first deputy president of the sent the following letter to the head of the verkh-issetskiy police department of yekaterinburg with the consent of the yekaterinburg town administration a group of citizens comprising mr sh. mr kuznetsov and ms m. held a picket in front of the building of the the picket notice indicated that the purpose of the picket was ‘ to attract public attention to violations of the human right of access to a court as the subsequent events demonstrated the picket organisers misled the officials of the yekaterinburg town administration as to the real purposes of their action instead of drawing public attention to the problems of judicial protection and violations of human rights as it was indicated in the picket notice if they believed that such problems existed which would be hard to contradict because the said problems exist in reality for three days the picket participants distributed printed leaflets and materials of a slanderous and insulting nature which targeted the president of the sverdlovsk regional court personally the information contained in the extract from the novaya gazeta newspaper was more than two years old it had been checked by the supreme qualification panel of judges and the prosecutor general s office and found to be slanderous of which the picket participants in particular mr sh and mr kuznetsov were perfectly aware the above stated begs the conclusion that the picket organisers deliberately and maliciously changed the nature of the action and in that way misled the public whom according to the picket notice they merely intended to acquaint with the state of judicial protection of human rights they have committed thereby an administrative offence by violating section of the decree of the presidium of the ussr supreme council of july as amended by the presidential decree of may and pursuant to section of that decree they are administratively liable under article of the code of administrative offences accordingly i ask you to institute administrative proceedings against mr sh. mr kuznetsov and ms m. in accordance with article of the said code prepare a report on an administrative offence and decide on the issue of their legal responsibility for that breach of law you are requested to inform me of the decision taken. on april an official of the verkh-issetskiy police department of yekaterinburg compiled a report on administrative offences committed by the applicant under article and of the code on administrative offences according to the report the applicant had given notice of the picket too late he had distributed leaflets of a slanderous and insulting nature against the president of the regional court and he had also obstructed the passage of citizens into the court-house court bailiffs mr r. and mr m. were listed as eyewitnesses on april the head of the verkh-issetskiy police department forwarded the report and supplementary materials to the verkh-issetskiy district court of yekaterinburg the matter was assigned to the justice of the peace of the circuit of the verkh-issetskiy district of yekaterinburg on may the applicant challenged the judicial formation and requested that the matter be examined in a neighbouring region he claimed that objective examination of the matter in yekaterinburg was impossible because it had been initiated at the instigation of the high-ranking officials of the regional court the justice dismissed his challenge holding that under the code on administrative offence there were no legal grounds to change the venue on may the justice issued a ruling on an administrative offence постановление по делу об административном правонарушении in which she found the applicant guilty on three counts firstly the justice held that the applicant had breached the established procedure for organising a picket he had sent the picket notice eight days before the picket date whereas both the ussr supreme council s decree and the local yekaterinburg regulation on public assemblies established a ten-day notification period secondly the justice found the applicant to have breached public order during the picket she relied on the following evidence the applicant s guilt is confirmed by the report on an administrative offence dated april the statements by the witnesses mr m. and mr r. who testified in court that they worked as court bailiffs in the at about a.m. on march they had gone onto the porch of the sverdlovsk regional court and seen some people with banners among them mr kuznetsov holding the banner ‘ ovcharuk resign who were standing on the porch right in front of the entrance on the top floor blocking the passage and distributing leaflets when they had asked them to show their identity documents and go down the stairs they had refused but they had gone down after a police officer had approached them judges coming to work had told them that the picket participants had blocked access to the court list of evidence showing the applicant s guilt continues the report by the court bailiff mr r. of march the report by the police officer from the verkh-issetskiy police station mr g. which indicated that between and march he had been responsible for public order during the picket in front of the the picket had been organised by mr kuznetsov mr sh and ms m. who at a.m. on the day of the picket were standing on the staircase at the entrance to the and thus obstructing access to the building following his intervention and that by the court bailiffs they had gone down to the pavement in front of the court-house and had not subsequently interfered with the normal functioning of the the judge does not accept the arguments by mr kuznetsov s representative to the effect that mr kuznetsov did not block access to the sverdlovsk regional court because these arguments contradict the evidence that has already been examined in court and because they can not be confirmed by the witnesses for the defence who were present at the picket from a.m. because by that time the picket participants had already descended the staircase on orders of the police officer and were no longer blocking access the photographs produced by the defence and examined in court can not prove that mr kuznetsov did not block access to the court-house because they depict solely the moment when they were taken rather than the entire time during which the picket had been held moreover the court does not know when the photographs were taken. thirdly the judge found that the picket had been conducted at variance with the aims listed in the notice according to the notice dated march the initiative group of citizens comprising mr sh. mr kuznetsov and ms m. held a protest action against violations of citizens right to judicial protection as the applicant s representative explained in court the picket aimed at attracting public attention to the problems of judicial protection such as refusals to accept a claim or unfair judgments the witness mr m. stated that he had brought and distributed a newspaper describing certain instances in which citizens rights to judicial protection had been breached at the same time the picket participants distributed extracts from the novaya gazeta newspaper containing a. politkovskaya s article ‘ ovcharuk and his team which in its contents did not correspond to the aims of the picket the distribution of those extracts was not contested by the applicant s representative in court and also confirmed by witnesses. the judge declared the applicant guilty under article and of the code of administrative offences and fined him russian roubles rub approximately euros eur on july the verkh-issetskiy district court of yekaterinburg on an appeal by the applicant upheld the ruling of the justice of the peace endorsing the reasons that she had given that judgment was final as no further ordinary appeal lay against it the constitution guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to hold meetings demonstrations marches and pickets article the decree of the presidium of the ussr supreme council no of july in force at the material time pursuant to presidential decree no of may provided that organisers of an assembly were to give written notice to the municipal authorities no later than ten days before the planned assembly section the authority was to give its response no later than five days before the assembly

much as although it is the town centre it is also privately owned the owner s stance on all political and religious issues is one of strict neutrality and i am charged with applying this philosophy i am therefore obliged to refuse permission for you to carry out a petition within the galleries or the adjacent car parks. on april the third applicant wrote again to the manager of the galleries asking him to reconsider his decision his letter remained unanswered the fourth applicant continued to try and reach the public by setting up stands by the roadside on public footpaths and going to the old town centre at which however is visited by a much smaller number of residents the deadline for letters of representation to the council regarding the building works was may on april the applicants submitted the letters of representation they had obtained the fourth applicant has produced a list of associations and others which were given permission to carry out collections set up stands and displays within the galleries these included the salvation army collection before christmas local school choirs carol-singing and collection before christmas the stop smoking campaign advertising display and handing out of nicotine patches the blood transfusion service blood collection the royal british legion collection for armistice day various photographers advertising and taking of photographs and british gas staffed advertising display from january to march sunderland council ran a consultation campaign under the banner your council your choice informing the local residents of three leadership choices for the future of the council and were allowed to use the galleries for this purpose this was a statutory consultation exercise carried out under section of the local government act which required local authorities to draw up proposals for the operation of executive arrangements and consult local electors before sending them to the secretary of state some people were reported as having responded to the survey at common law a private property owner may in certain circumstances be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes this is the case with commercial premises such as shops theatres and restaurants as well as private premises for example there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing any implied invitation may be revoked at will a private person s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness in cin properties ltd v. rawlins eglr estates gazette law reports where the applicants young men were barred from a shopping centre in wellingborough as the private company owner cin considered that their behaviour was a nuisance the court of appeal held that cin had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre in giving judgment lord phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section of the highways act later replaced by section of the highways act which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence he also considered case-law from north america concerning the applicants arguments for the finding of some kind of public right of more obvious relevance are two north american cases in uston v. resorts international inc. n.j. the supreme court of new jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises in that case a gaming casino to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but on the contrary have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises however that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in state v. schmid n.j. which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the first amendment the general proposition cited above has no application in english law the case of harrison v. carswell d.l.r in the supreme court of canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre against the wishes of the owner of the centre the majority of the supreme court held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass however laskin c.j.c. in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner s whim he said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and if it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which in my view arises upon the opening of a shopping centre with public areas of the kind i have mentioned at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants i would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour and i need not spell out here what this embraces or by reason of unlawful activity such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based. i have already said that this was a dissenting judgment nevertheless counsel for the applicants submitted that we should apply it in the present case i accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary however there is no such necessity where parliament has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by section of the highways act and section of the highways act harrison v. carswell makes no mention of any similar legislation in where parliament has legislated and the council as representing the public chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides it is not for the courts to intervene i would allow this appeal on the basis that cin had the right subject only to the issue under section of the race relations act to determine any licence the applicants may have had to enter the centre. the parties have referred to case-law from the and the first amendment to the federal constitution protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly the united states supreme court has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places such as streets and parks known as public fora for the exercise of free speech hague v. committee for industrial organisation u.s. united states supreme court reports in marsh v. s.ct supreme court reporter l.ed united states supreme court reports lawyers edition the supreme court also held that a privately owned corporate town a company town having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the first amendment rights of free speech and peaceable assembly it has found that the first amendment does not require access to privately owned properties such as shopping centres on the basis that there has to be state action a degree of state involvement for the amendment to apply see for example hudgens v. nlrb u.s. the supreme court has taken the position that the first amendment does not prevent a private shopping-centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations lloyd corp. v. tanner u.s. s.ct l.ed this did not however prevent state constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the federal constitution to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping-centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions pruneyard shopping center v. robbins u.s. l.ed s.ct some state courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their state constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures see for example batchelder v. allied stores int l n.e west s north eastern reporter massachussetts lloyd corp. v. whiffen p. west s pacific reporter oregon southcenter joint venture v. national democratic policy comm. p. washington some cases found state obligations arising due to state involvement for example bock v. westminster mall co. p. colorado the shopping centre was a state actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas and jamestown v. beneda n.w west s north western reporter north dakota where the shopping centre was owned by a public body although leased to a private developer other cases cited as indicating a right to reasonable access to property under state private law were state v. shack a west s atlantic reporter new jersey where the court ruled that under new jersey property law ownership of real property did not include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers in this case a publicly funded non-profit lawyer attempting to advise migrant workers uston v. resorts international a new jersey a new jersey case concerning casinos where the court held that when property owners open their premises to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably although it was acknowledged that the private law of most states did not require a right of reasonable access to privately owned property p. and streetwatch v. national railroad passenger corp. f.

case the public prosecutor contended that the applicant had attended various illegal public meetings between february and february and that he had made speeches in which he had praised the pkk and its leader the public prosecutor alleged that those events had been organised either in line with the policies of the pkk or under its instructions with a view to supporting that organisation taking into account the intensity variety and continuity of the applicant s activities the public prosecutor considered that the applicant s acts constituted knowingly and willingly aiding the pkk he then asked the assize court to convict the applicant under articles and of the criminal code of membership of the pkk on september the diyarbakır assize court held the fourth and the last hearing in the case and

chanted slogans nor carried banners he stated that he had not directed demonstrators to chant slogans or to carry banners abdulcelil i̇mret submitted that he had attended those meetings at the request of the security forces and that the latter had asked him to warn the crowds not to resist them and to work with them with a view to preventing possible disturbances the file contains police reports photographs and video recordings of the events which the accused attended and the speeches he made on the basis of the evidence in the file it has been understood that during all the demonstrations and marches held in batman which abdulcelil i̇mret attended slogans in favour abdullah öcalan were chanted and the demonstrators carried banners it has also been understood that the speeches made by the accused praised abdullah öcalan it is established that the accused attended the public meetings in question and organised them although the accused submitted that their aim had been to prevent clashes between the demonstrators and the security forces and that they had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of the pkk when they had participated in the demonstrations and marches in question taking into account the content of the case file and their acts during those meetings their defence submissions have been found to be baseless as a result of the trial and in the light of the evidence it has been established that abdulcelil i̇mret worked as the head of the batman branch of dehap and that subsequent to the closure of dehap he was the head of the batman branch of the dtp he attended ten marches and demonstrations held between february and february organised by the above-mentioned political parties illegal slogans were chanted and illegal banners were carried during those meetings in some of those meetings abdulcelil i̇mret read press statements containing expressions praising abdullah öcalan all of the marches and demonstrations in question were illegal within the meaning of section of the marches and demonstrations act law no it has been established that all of those marches and demonstrations were organised in line with the ‘ democratic political struggle strategy adopted by the pkk recently that the media broadcasts in line with the pkk s strategies had announced those marches and demonstrations prior to them and that the same media organs had used those demonstrations as propaganda materials after they had been held abdulcelil i̇mret and m.g organised several illegal demonstrations in line with the pkk s instructions and during those demonstrations they addressed the demonstrators who chanted slogans and carried banners containing expressions in favour of the pkk and abdullah öcalan in their speeches the accused praised the pkk s leader taking into account the continuity and nature of their acts it is considered that those acts went beyond the offence of dissemination of propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and amounted to the offence proscribed by article of the criminal code that is to say ‘ knowingly and willingly aiding an illegal organisation without being in the hierarchical structure therefore it has been decided to convict the accused under article of the criminal code on april the court of cassation upheld the first-instance judgment by law no which entered into force on july paragraph of article of the criminal code was amended the applicant applied to the diyarbakır assize court requesting it to examine whether the amended version of that provision could be considered to be in his favour and if so whether the execution of his sentence could be suspended he added that he was currently serving his prison sentence on august the diyarbakır assize court decided to reduce the applicant s sentence to five years two months and fifteen days imprisonment the court rejected the applicant s request to have the execution of his sentence suspended on april law no entered into force at the material time article of the criminal code read as follows anyone who establishes or directs an organisation for the purpose of criminal activity shall be liable to imprisonment of between two and six years provided that the structure of the organisation the number of members and the quantity of equipment and supplies are sufficient to commit the intended crimes anyone who

if he is not a member of that organisation shall also be punished for being a member of the organisation anyone who aids an illegal organisation knowingly and willingly even if he does not belong to the hierarchical structure of the organisation shall be punished as a member of the organisation anyone who spreads propaganda for the organisation or its objectives shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of between one and three years if the said crime is committed through the press or other media the sentence shall be increased by one half. paragraphs and of article were amended by law

structure of the organisation shall be punished as a member of the organisation the penalty to be imposed for membership may be reduced by up to two thirds depending on the nature of the assistance. article of the criminal code reads as follows anyone who forms an armed organisation to commit the crimes listed in the fourth and fifth sections of this chapter or commands such an organisation shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between ten and fifteen years anyone who becomes a member of an armed organisation mentioned in the first paragraph of this article shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between five and ten years other provisions relating to the crime of establishing an organisation for the purpose of criminal activity are also applicable to this crime. between august

sentence of section of law no as amended on april by law no currently reads as follows any person who disseminates propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation by justifying praising or encouraging the use of methods constituting coercion violence or threats shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of one to five years at its plenary session held on and march the venice commission adopted an opinion on articles and of the penal code of turkey cdl-ad the relevant parts of the opinion read as follows membership of an armed organisation art the penal code does not contain a definition of an armed organisation or an armed group in its judgment e. k. of april the general criminal board of the court of cassation listed the main criteria that a criminal organisation for the purposes of article of the penal code should display the group has to have at least three members there should be a tight or loose hierarchical connection between the members of the group and an abstract link between the members is not sufficient the members should have a common intention to commit crimes even though no crime has yet been committed the group has to present continuity in time and the structure of the group the number of its members tools and equipment at the disposal of the group should be sufficient/appropriate for the commission of the envisaged crimes there is a rich case-law of the court of cassation in which the high court developed the criterion of ‘ membership in an armed organisation the court of cassation examined different acts of the suspect concerned taking account of their ‘ continuity diversity and intensity in order to see whether those acts prove that the suspect has any ‘ organic relationship with the organisation or whether his or her acts may be considered as committed knowingly and wilfully within the ‘ hierarchical structure of the organisation if this ‘ organic relationship with the organisation can not be proven on the basis of acts attributed to the defendant which do not present any ‘ continuity diversity or intensity the paragraphs on ‘ aiding and abetting an armed organisation or ‘ committing crime on behalf of an armed organisation under article may be applied see below according to non-governmental sources in the application of article the domestic courts in many cases decide on the membership of a person in an armed organisation on the basis of very weak evidence which would raise questions as to the ‘ foreseeability of the application of article amnesty international in its report on turkey considered that conduct which is not in itself criminal as for instance an activity related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of assembly association and expression is considered as evidence of membership of the defendants in an armed organisation the reason for this approach according to the report is that the prosecution services perceive those activities as having the same overall objective as a terrorist group and as a result ‘ individuals have been prosecuted for membership of terrorist organisation on charges relating solely to their engagement in peaceful and in themselves lawful pro-kurdish activities the examples of concrete cases provided by amnesty international in which the evidence was considered to link the defendants to a terrorist organisation included attendance at six different demonstrations allegedly organised by a terrorist organisation and a speech made at one of those demonstrations or in another case the participation of the defendant in the ‘ political academy organised by the peace and democracy party bdp a recognised pro-kurdish political party and his diverse activities in the framework of this academy in the case of yılmaz and kılıç v. turkey the ecthr considered although in the context of article of the former penal code concerning aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation that where the only evidence which led to the criminal conviction of the applicants under article was forms of expression statements by the applicants content of the slogans they shouted during a public demonstration etc it should be concluded that there was an interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression para of the judgment subsequently the court examined whether this interference was justified as being necessary in a democratic society the court applied the same principle in the case of gül and others v. turkey and held that the criminal conviction of the applicants on the basis of article of the former penal code constituted an interference with their right to freedom of expression since the only evidence used against them was the content of the slogans they shouted during a public demonstration the commission reiterates that conviction on the basis of weak evidence in the application of article may create problems in the field of article echr since this provision embodies inter alia the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused s detriment for instance by analogy in the cases where the only evidence which led the domestic courts to convict the defendant for being a member of an armed organisation are forms of expression as for instance in the above-mentioned yılmaz and kılıç case reliance on weak evidence may also give rise to problems concerning the ‘ foreseeability of the interference into the right to freedom of expression of the defendant for the venice commission any allegation of membership to an armed organisation must be established with convincing evidence and beyond any reasonable doubt the venice commission recommends first that the established criteria in the case law of the court of cassation that acts attributed to a defendant should show ‘ in their continuity diversity and intensity his/her ‘ organic relationship to an organisation or they should prove that he/she acted knowingly and willingly within the ‘ hierarchical structure of the organisation should be applied strictly the loose application of these criteria may give rise to issues concerning in particular the principle of legality within the meaning of article echr second the expression of an opinion in its different forms should not be the only evidence before the domestic courts to decide on the membership of the defendant in an armed organisation where the only evidence consists of forms of expression the conviction for being a member of an armed organisation would constitute an interference with the right of the defendants to freedom of expression and that the necessity of this interference on the basis of the criteria as set forth in the case-law of the ecthr in particular the criteria of ‘ incitement to violence should be examined in the concrete circumstances of each case application of article in conjunction with article paragraph of article provides that ‘ all other provisions related to the crime of establishing an organization to commit a crime will be applied in conjunction with this provision. article of the criminal code is of particular importance since in many recent judgments of the court of cassation article was applied in conjunction with paragraphs and of article on the basis of the reference made in article to ‘ other provisions related to forming a criminal organisation according to paragraphs and of article any person who commits an offence on behalf of an organisation para or aids and abets an organisation knowingly and willingly para shall also be sentenced for the offence of being a member of that organisation art although he/she is not a member of that organisation in a judgment of march the general criminal board of the court of cassation held that acts such as participating in a public demonstration following a general call from pro-pkk media outlets making a victory sign and shouting slogans to support and in favour of the leader of a terrorist organisation and clashing with the security forces are considered crimes committed on behalf of the terrorist organisation in this case although the membership in an armed organisation was not established the defendant was convicted as a member of a criminal organisation according to paragraph of article applied in conjunction with article by this judgment the court of cassation annulled the decision of the diyarbakır assize court which had considered that in order for a court to conclude that a crime was committed on behalf of an organisation the latter must have called for action not to an undefined collective but rather to an individual person who is capable of directly committing that act in a judgment of march the chamber of the court of cassation also held that participation in an illegal public demonstration following a general call of the armed organisation on its internet site covering one s face during a demonstration in order to hide his/her identity and shouting slogans in support of the armed organisation were considered as committing crimes on behalf of an armed organisation and the defendant although his membership was not proven was convicted also as a member of an armed organisation article in conjunction with article article concerning aiding and abetting an organisation knowingly and willingly was also applied to cases involving freedom of expression in the nedim şener case the applicant was prosecuted under article in conjunction with article aiding and abetting an armed organisation for having contributed at the request of the suspected members of a criminal organisation to the preparation of books criticising the actions of the government in a judgment of june of the court of cassation the fact that the defendants in the framework of a campaign instigated by the terrorist organisation on its internet sites have prepared a declaration which states ‘ if it is a crime to refer to öcalan as mr. öcalan i hereby commit this crime by referring to öcalan as mr. öcalan and i denounce myself to the authorities and have collected signatures for this declaration was considered as ‘ knowingly and willingly aiding the criminal organisation consequently although the ‘ organic relationship of the defendant with an armed organisation can not be proven on the basis of the established criterion developed by the court of cassation in its case-law related to article paras and the defendants who are considered to have committed crimes on behalf of an armed organisation para of article or have aided and abetted an armed organisation knowingly and willingly para of article are also sentenced for the offence of being a member of that organisation under article a new paragraph has been added to article of the anti-terror law no by an amendment of april according to this new paragraph those who committed the crime indicated in the second paragraph of article propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation the crime indicated in the second paragraph of article printing and disseminating declarations made by terrorist organisations which legitimise or praise the violent or threatening methods of terrorist organisations or encourage the use of such methods the crime indicated in the first paragraph of article of the public demonstrations law no participating to an unlawful demonstration shall not be sentenced separately under article of the penal code the authorities indicated that with this amendment the scope of the freedom of expression was broadened in the application of anti-terror legislation the venice commission welcomes the amendment introduced to article of the anti-terror law which excluded the above-mentioned crimes from the scope of application of article with this amendment the suspects accused of having committed such crimes shall not be punished separately as members of an armed organisation under article nevertheless the venice commission considers that the scope of this amendment is rather limited and does not provide for sufficient protection to the exercise of freedom of expression and assembly in particular first the amendment to article of the anti-terror law excluded the above-mentioned crimes only from the scope of application of article however some forms of expression as indicated in the judgments of the court of cassation cited in paragraph may also fall under the scope of article aiding and abetting an organisation this may lead to abusive application in practice since a form of expression considered as being in support of an organisation may be sanctioned under article instead of article in order to sentence the defendants as if they were members of an armed organisation under article although their organic relationship with an armed organisation is not established in conclusion the venice commission recommends that the sentence ‘ although he is not a member of that organisation shall also be sentenced for the offence of being a member of that organisation. in paragraphs and of article be repealed in this case those who commit the crimes indicated in paragraphs and of article would not be sanctioned as members of an armed organisation under article but by other separate sanctions should this sentence in paragraph and be maintained the turkish authorities should consider limiting the application of article in conjunction with article to cases which do not involve the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. in a report published on january following a visit to turkey between and october mr thomas hammarberg the former commissioner for human rights of the council of europe stated the following the commissioner is fully aware of the severe threat posed to turkish society by terrorism and terrorist organisations as well as of the obligation of the turkish state to combat it with effective measures including effective investigations and fair proceedings he wishes to underline however that a major lesson learned in the fight against terrorism in europe has been the importance of public confidence in the justice system this means that any allegation of terrorist activity must be established with convincing evidence and beyond any reasonable doubt experience has shown time and time again that any deviation from established human rights principles in the fight against terrorism including in the functioning of the judiciary ultimately serves the interests of terrorist organisations in this connection it is crucial to bear in mind that violence or the threat to use violence is an essential component of an act of terrorism and that restrictions of human rights in the fight against terrorism ‘ must be defined as precisely as possible and be necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued the commissioner considers that the provisions contained in the turkish anti-terror legislation and article tcc allow for a very wide margin of appreciation in particular in cases where membership in a terrorist organisation has not been proven and when an act or statement may be deemed to coincide with the aims or instructions of a terrorist organisation the commissioner encourages the turkish authorities to reflect on and address these concerns through legislative measures and/or case-law. in a memorandum on freedom of expression and media freedom in turkey published on february following a visit to turkey between and april commdh mr nils muižnieks the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe stressed the need for a complete overhaul of the turkish criminal code including article and and article he considered that the overhaul should take full account of the court s case-law and the venice commission opinion cited above on november human rights watch published a report entitled protesting as a terrorist offence the arbitrary use of terrorism laws to prosecute and incarcerate demonstrators in turkey the seventyfive-page report mainly concerned trials and convictions of demonstrators in turkey under laws nos and the report in so far as relevant reads as follows in turkey many hundreds of people currently face prosecution or are serving substantial sentences for terrorism convictions their ‘ crime was to engage in peaceful protest or to throw stones or burn a tire at a protest legal amendments since along with case law since have allowed courts in turkey to convict demonstrators under the harshest terrorism laws by invoking two articles of the turkish penal code in combination with the anti-terror law the penal code introduced article entitled ‘ forming organized groups with the intention of committing crime this article has been most commonly used to punish criminal gangs as a separate article discussed below criminalizes membership in armed political organizations however courts have also applied article to those deemed to be associated with armed political organizations this article also introduced a provision allowing individuals to be treated as if they are members of an armed organization even if they are not article states a person who aids and abets the organization knowingly and willingly although he or she does not belong to the hierarchical structure of the organization shall be punished as though a member of the organization while article has not recently been applied to pro-kurdish demonstrators it has in some cases been applied to leftist demonstrators who have been punished as ‘ members of armed organizations for ‘ knowingly and willingly aiding them without providing any material assistance this undefined and vague charge currently in use against leftist demonstrators deserves a separate study turkish penal code articles and ‘ committing a crime on behalf of an organization and ‘ knowingly and willingly aiding and abetting an organization are striking examples of legal provisions that are so vaguely worded and lacking in clarity about what is prohibited as to offer an individual no indication of how to regulate or limit conduct recommendations to the turkish government urgently amend turkish penal code article ‘ forming criminal organizations and repeal ‘ committing a crime on behalf of an organization and ‘ aiding and abetting an organization knowingly and willingly which are vague lack legal clarity and specificity and are therefore subject to arbitrary application set up a review board to examine all cases concluded under these articles for compliance with international human rights law obligations with a view to quashing sentences under turkish penal code articles and in connection with articles and on march amnesty international published a report entitled turkey decriminalize dissent time to deliver on the right to freedom of expression the relevant passages of the report read as follows article assisting a terrorist organization article of the turkish penal code criminalises assisting a terrorist organisation unlike article it is a self-standing offence that does not require the commission of a further criminal act like article however it allows for the sentencing of those convicted under it as though they were members of the organisation they are found to have assisted in full the article reads ‘ a person who knowingly and willingly assists the organization but is not within the hierarchical structure of the organization is punished as a member of the organization the punishment given for membership can be reduced by one third depending on the nature of the assistance given. as with article this article is often used to prosecute conduct protected by the rights to freedom of expression association and assembly indeed the choice of prosecutors to prosecute under or often appears arbitrary with similar behaviour sometimes prosecuted under one sometimes under the other and sometimes under article criminalizing membership of a terrorist organization directly as with prosecutions under when prosecutors seek to convict a person under article they often do not provide evidence demonstrating a link to a terrorist organization nor do they attempt to prove that the accused was engaged in any criminal offence or in aiding and abetting other than supposedly assisting the proscribed organization it is incumbent on the turkish authorities to ensure that article is not used to bring prosecutions that violate the rights to freedom of expression association and assembly or other human rights to this end the government should issue and publish guidelines for prosecutors that set out clear criteria for when assisting an armed group can be criminalized including the requirement that such assistance must either in and of itself be a recognizable criminal offence or be directly linked to the planning or commission of one short of evidence of such acts no inference should be drawn from someone undertaking a lawful act such as for example participating in a peaceful demonstration this is so even if such acts benefit through lawful means goals shared by a terrorist organization the motive of the individual who is carrying out the lawful acts is irrelevant anyone carrying out a lawful act which does not aid and abet the planning or commission of a crime should not be criminalized on the sole basis of their political convictions amnesty international urges the turkish government to adopt guidelines for prosecutors on the application of article of the penal code that set out clear criteria for when assisting an armed group can be criminalized including the requirement that such assistance must either in and of itself be a recognizable criminal offence or be directly linked to the planning or commission of one,case originated application republic turkey lodged court article convention protection human rights

the case originated in four applications nos and against the republic of turkey lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a turkish political party refah partisi the welfare party refah and three turkish nationals mr necmettin erbakan mr şevket kazan and mr ahmet tekdal the applicants on may the applicants alleged in particular that the dissolution of refah by the turkish constitutional court and the suspension of certain political rights of the other applicants who were leaders of refah at the material time had breached articles and of the convention and articles and of protocol no the applications were transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the applications were allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court they were joined rule and on october they were declared partly admissible by a chamber of that section composed of mr j.-p. costa president mr w. fuhrmann mr l. loucaides mr r. türmen sir nicolas bratza mrs h.s greve mr k. traja judges and mrs s. dollé section registrar on july the chamber gave judgment holding by four votes to three that there had been no violation of article of the convention and unanimously that it was not necessary to examine separately the complaints under articles and of the convention and articles and of protocol no the joint dissenting opinion of judges fuhrmann loucaides and sir nicolas bratza was annexed to the judgment on october the applicants requested under article of the convention and rule that the case be referred to the grand chamber on december a panel of the grand chamber decided to refer the case to the grand chamber the composition of the grand chamber was determined according to the provisions of article and of the convention and rule the applicants and the government each filed a memorial a hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on june rule there appeared before the court one of the applicants mr kazan was also present the court heard addresses by mr kazan mr hincker and mr alpaslan the first applicant refah partisi the welfare party refah was a political party founded on july it was represented by its chairman mr necmettin erbakan who is also the second applicant he was born in and lives in ankara an engineer by training he is a politician at the material time he was a member of parliament and refah s chairman the third applicant mr şevket kazan who was born in lives in ankara he is a politician and a lawyer at the material time he was a member of parliament and a vice-chairman of refah the fourth applicant mr ahmet tekdal who was born in lives in ankara he is a politician and a lawyer at the material time he was a member of parliament and a vice-chairman of refah refah took part in a number of general and local elections in the local elections in march refah obtained about of the votes and its candidates were elected mayor in a number of towns including five large cities in the general election of it obtained of the votes the sixty-two mps elected as a result took part between and in the work of parliament and its various committees including the committee on constitutional questions which proposed amendments to article of the constitution that became law on july during the debate in parliament on the new sixth paragraph of article of the constitution see paragraph below the chairman of the committee on constitutional questions explained when he presented the draft it had prepared that the constitutional court would not restrict itself to noting the unconstitutional nature of the individual acts of the members of a party but would then be obliged to declare that the party concerned had become a centre of anticonstitutional activities on account of those acts one mp representing the parliamentary group of the motherland party emphasised the need to change the relevant provisions of law no on the regulation of political parties to take account of the new sixth paragraph of article of the constitution ultimately refah obtained approximately of the votes in the general election of december and about of the votes in the local elections of november the results of the general election made refah the largest political party in turkey with a total of seats in the grand national assembly which had members at the material time on june refah came to power by forming a coalition government with the centre-right true path party doğru yol partisi led by mrs tansu ciller according to an opinion poll carried out in january if a general election had been held at that time refah would have obtained of the votes the same poll predicted that refah might obtain of the votes in the general election to be held roughly four years later on may principal state counsel at the court of cassation applied to the turkish constitutional court to have refah dissolved on the grounds that it was a centre mihrak of activities contrary to the principles of secularism in support of his application he referred to the following acts and remarks by certain leaders and members of refah whenever they spoke in public refah s chairman and other leaders advocated the wearing of islamic headscarves in state schools and buildings occupied by public administrative authorities whereas the constitutional court had already ruled that this infringed the principle of secularism enshrined in the constitution at a meeting on constitutional reform refah s chairman mr necmettin erbakan had made proposals tending towards the abolition of secularism in turkey he had suggested that the adherents of each religious movement should obey their own rules rather than the rules of turkish law on april mr necmettin erbakan had asked refah s representatives in the grand national assembly to consider whether the change in the social order which the party sought would be peaceful or violent and would be achieved harmoniously or by bloodshed at a seminar held in january in sivas mr necmettin erbakan had called on muslims to join refah saying that only his party could establish the supremacy of the koran through a holy war jihad and that muslims should therefore make donations to refah rather than distributing alms to third parties during ramadan mr necmettin erbakan had received the heads of the islamist movements at the residence reserved for the prime minister thus assuring them of his support several members of refah including some in high office had made speeches calling for the secular political system to be replaced by a theocratic system these persons had also advocated the elimination of the opponents of this policy if necessary by force refah by refusing to open disciplinary proceedings against the members concerned and even in certain cases facilitating the dissemination of their speeches had tacitly approved the views expressed on may a refah mp mr i̇brahim halil çelik had said in front of journalists in the corridors of the parliament building that blood would flow if an attempt was made to close the i̇mam-hatip theological colleges that the situation might become worse than in algeria that he personally wanted blood to flow so that democracy could be installed in the country that he would strike back against anyone who attacked him and that he would fight to the end for the introduction of islamic law sharia the minister of justice mr şevket kazan a refah mp and vice-chairman of the party had expressed his support for the mayor of sincan by visiting him in the prison where he had been detained pending trial after being charged with publicly vindicating international islamist terrorist groups principal state counsel further observed that refah had not opened any disciplinary proceedings against those responsible for the above-mentioned acts and remarks on july principal state counsel submitted new evidence against refah to the constitutional court on august refah s representatives filed their defence submissions in which they relied on international human-rights protection instruments including the convention pointing out that these instruments formed part of turkish written law they further referred to the case-law of the commission which had expressed the opinion that article of the convention had been breached in the cases concerning the united communist party of turkey and the socialist party and to the case-law of the court and the commission on the restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of association authorised by the second paragraphs of articles and of the convention they contended that the dissolution of refah was not prompted by a pressing social need and was not necessary in a democratic society nor according to refah s representatives was their party s dissolution justified by application of the clear and present danger test laid down by the supreme court of the united states of america refah s representatives further rejected principal state counsel s argument that the party was a centre of activities which undermined the secular nature of the republic they submitted that refah was not caught by the criteria laid down in the law on the regulation of political parties for determining whether a political party constituted a centre of anticonstitutional activities they observed inter alia that the prosecuting authorities had not issued any warning to refah which had four million members that might have enabled it to expel any of its members whose acts had contravened the provisions of the criminal code refah s representatives also set out their point of view on the concept of secularism they asserted that the principle of secularism implied respect for all beliefs and that refah had shown such respect in its political activity the applicants representatives alleged that in accusing mr necmettin erbakan of supporting the use of force to achieve political ends and of infringing the principle of secularism the prosecuting authorities had merely cited extracts from his speeches which they had distorted and taken out of context moreover these remarks were covered by mr necmettin erbakan s parliamentary immunity they further noted that the dinner he had given to senior officials of the religious affairs department and former members of the theology faculty had been presented by principal state counsel as a reception organised for the leaders of islamist fundamentalist movements which had in any event been legally proscribed since with regard to the remarks of the other refah leaders and members criticised by principal state counsel s office refah s representatives observed that these did not constitute any criminal offence they asserted that none of the mps whose speeches had been referred to by principal state counsel was authorised to represent refah or held office within the party and claimed that the prosecuting authorities had not set in motion the procedure laid down in the law on the regulation of political parties so as to give refah the opportunity if the need arose to decide whether or not the persons concerned should continue to be members of the party the first time refah s leadership had been informed of the remarks criticised in the case had been when they read principal state counsel s submissions the three mps under attack had been expelled from the party which had thus done what was necessary to avoid becoming a centre of illegal activities within the meaning of the law on the regulation of political parties on august principal state counsel filed his observations on the merits of the case with the constitutional court he submitted that according to the convention and the case-law of the turkish courts on constitutional-law issues nothing obliged states to tolerate the existence of political parties that sought the destruction of democracy and the rule of law he contended that refah by describing itself as an army engaged in a jihad and by openly declaring its intention to replace the republic s statute law by sharia had demonstrated that its objectives were incompatible with the requirements of a democratic society refah s aim to establish a plurality of legal systems in which each group would be governed by a legal system in conformity with its members religious beliefs constituted the first stage in the process designed to substitute a theocratic regime for the republic in their observations on the merits of the case refah s representatives again argued that the dissolution of their party could not be grounded on any of the restrictions permitted by the second paragraph of article of the convention they went on to say that article was not applicable in the case as refah had nothing in common with political parties which sought to install a totalitarian regime furthermore the plurality of legal systems which their party proposed was actually intended to promote the freedom to enter into contracts and the freedom to choose which court should have jurisdiction on november principal state counsel submitted his observations orally on and november mr necmettin erbakan submitted his oral observations on behalf of refah in a judgment of january which it delivered following proceedings on preliminary issues it had instituted of its own motion as the court dealing with the merits the constitutional court ruled that regard being had to article of the constitution the second paragraph of section of the law on the regulation of political parties was unconstitutional and declared it null and void article taken together with section d of the same law provided that for a political party to be considered a centre of activities contrary to the fundamental principles of the republic its members had to have been convicted of criminal offences according to the constitutional court that legal restriction did not cover all cases where the principles of the republic had been flouted it pointed out among other observations that after the repeal of article of the criminal code activities contrary to the principle of secularism no longer attracted criminal penalties on january the constitutional court dissolved refah on the ground that it had become a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism it based its decision on sections b and of law no on the regulation of political parties it also noted the transfer of refah s assets to the treasury as an automatic consequence of dissolution in accordance with section of law no in its judgment the constitutional court first dismissed the preliminary objections raised by refah in that connection it held that the parliamentary immunity of the mps whose remarks had been mentioned in principal state counsel s submissions of may had nothing to do with consideration of an application for the dissolution of a political party and forfeiture of political rights by its members but was a question of the criminal responsibility of the mps concerned which was not a matter of constitutional law with regard to the merits the constitutional court held that while political parties were the main protagonists of democratic politics their activities were not exempt from certain restrictions in particular activities by them incompatible with the rule of law could not be tolerated the constitutional court referred to the provisions of the constitution which imposed respect for secularism on the various organs of political power it also cited the numerous provisions of domestic legislation requiring political parties to apply the principle of secularism in a number of fields of political and social life the constitutional court observed that secularism was one of the indispensable conditions of democracy in turkey the principle of secularism was safeguarded by the constitution on account of the country s historical experience and the specific features of islam the rules of sharia were incompatible with the democratic regime the principle of secularism prevented the state from manifesting a preference for a particular religion or belief and constituted the foundation of freedom of conscience and equality between citizens before the law intervention by the state to preserve the secular nature of the political regime had to be considered necessary in a democratic society the constitutional court held that the following evidence proved that refah had become a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism see paragraphs below refah s chairman mr necmettin erbakan had encouraged the wearing of islamic headscarves in public and educational establishments on october at the party s fourth ordinary general meeting he had said when we were in government for four years the notorious article of the persecution code was never applied against any child in the country in our time there was never any question of hostility to the wearing of headscarves in his speech of december before the general election he had said university chancellors are going to retreat before the headscarf when refah comes to power. but manifesting one s religion in such a manner amounted to exerting pressure on persons who did not follow that practice and created discrimination on the ground of religion or beliefs that finding was supported by various rulings of the constitutional court and the supreme administrative court and by the case-law of the european commission of human rights on applications nos and concerning the wearing of headscarves at universities the plurality of legal systems proposed by mr necmettin erbakan was nothing to do with the freedom to enter into contracts as refah claimed but was an attempt to establish a distinction between citizens on the ground of their religion and beliefs and was aimed at the installation of a theocratic regime on march mr erbakan had made the following speech to the national assembly ‘ you shall live in a manner compatible with your beliefs we want despotism to be abolished there must be several legal systems the citizen must be able to choose for himself which legal system is most appropriate for him within a framework of general principles moreover that has always been the case throughout our history in our history there have been various religious movements everyone lived according to the legal rules of his own organisation and so everyone lived in peace why then should i be obliged to live according to another s rules the right to choose one s own legal system is an integral part of the freedom of religion. in addition mr necmettin erbakan had spoken as follows on october at a refah party conference we shall guarantee all human rights we shall guarantee to everyone the right to live as he sees fit and to choose the legal system he prefers we shall free the administration from centralism the state which you have installed is a repressive state not a state at the people s service you do not allow the freedom to choose one s code of law when we are in power a muslim will be able to get married before the mufti if he wishes and a christian will be able to marry in church if he prefers. the plurality of legal systems advocated by mr necmettin erbakan in his speeches had its origin in the practice introduced in the first years of islam by the medina agreement which had given the jewish and polytheist communities the right to live according to their own legal systems not according to islamic law on the basis of the medina agreement some islamist thinkers and politicians had proposed a model of peaceful social co-existence under which each religious group would be free to choose its own legal system since the foundation of the nizam party in dissolved by a judgment of may mr necmettin erbakan had been seeking to replace the single legal system with a plurality of legal systems the constitutional court further observed that in a plurality of legal systems as proposed by refah society would have to be divided into several religious movements each individual would have to choose the movement to which he wished to belong and would thus be subjected to the rights and obligations prescribed by the religion of his community the constitutional court pointed out that such a system whose origins lay in the history of islam as a political regime was inimical to the consciousness of allegiance to a nation having legislative and judicial unity it would naturally impair judicial unity since each religious movement would set up its own courts and the ordinary courts would be obliged to apply the law according to the religion of those appearing before them thus obliging the latter to reveal their beliefs it would also undermine legislative and judicial unity the preconditions for secularism and the consciousness of nationhood given that each religious movement would be empowered to decree what legal rules should be applicable to its members in addition mr necmettin erbakan had made a speech on april to the refah group in parliament in which he had advocated setting up a theocratic regime if necessary through force the second important point is this refah will come to power and a just social order adil dozen will be established the question we must ask ourselves is whether this change will be violent or peaceful whether it will entail bloodshed i would have preferred not to have to use those terms but in the face of all that in the face of terrorism and so that everyone can see the true situation clearly i feel obliged to do so today turkey must take a decision the welfare party will establish a just order that is certain but will the transition be peaceful or violent will it be achieved harmoniously or by bloodshed the sixty million citizens must make up their minds on that point. the reception given by mr necmettin erbakan at the prime minister s residence to the leaders of various religious movements who had attended in vestments denoting their religious allegiance unambiguously evidenced refah s chairman s support for these religious groups vis-à-vis public opinion in a public speech in april mr şevki yılmaz mp for the province of rize had issued a clear call to wage a jihad and had argued for the introduction of islamic law making the following declaration we shall certainly call to account those who turn their backs on the precepts of the koran and those who deprive allah s messenger of his jurisdiction in their country. in another public speech also in april mr şevki yılmaz had said in the hereafter you will be summoned with the leaders you have chosen in this life have you considered to what extent the koran is applied in this country i have done the sums only of the rules in the koran are applied in this country six thousand five hundred verses have been quietly forgotten you found a koranic school you build a hostel you pay for a child s education you teach you preach none of that is part of the chapter on jihad but of that on the amel-i salih peacetime activities jihad is the name given to the quest for power for the advent of justice for the propagation of justice and for glorification of allah s word allah did not see that task as an abstract political concept he made it a requirement for warriors cahudi what does that mean that jihad must be waged by an army the commander is identified the condition to be met before prayer namaz is the islamisation of power allah says that before mosques it is the path of power which must be muslim it is not erecting vaulted ceilings in the places of prayer which will lead you to paradise for allah does not ask whether you have built up vaulted ceilings in this country he will not ask that he will ask you if you have reached a sufficient level today if muslims have a hundred liras they must give thirty to the koranic schools to train our children girls and boys and sixty must be given to the political establishments which open the road to power allah asked all his prophets to fight for power you can not name a single member of a religious movement who does not fight for power i tell you if i had as many heads as i have hairs on my head even if each of those heads were to be torn from my shoulders for following the way of the koran i would not abandon my cause the question allah will ask you is this ‘ why in the time of the blasphemous regime did you not work for the construction of an islamic state erbakan and his friends want to bring islam to this country in the form of a political party the prosecutor understood that clearly if we could understand that as he did the problem would be solved even abraham the jew has realised that in this country the symbol of islam is refah he who incites the muslim community cemaat to take up arms before political power is in muslim hands is a fool or a traitor doing the bidding of others for none of the prophets authorised war before the capture of state power muslims are intelligent they do not reveal how they intend to beat their enemy the general staff gives orders and the soldiers obey if the general staff reveals its plan it is up to the commanders of the muslim community to make a new plan our mission is not to talk but to apply the war plan as soldiers in the army criminal proceedings had been brought against mr şevki yılmaz although his antipathy to secularism was well-known refah had adopted him as a candidate in local-government elections after he had been elected mayor of rize refah had made sure that he was elected as an mp in the turkish grand national assembly in a public speech on march and a television interview first recorded in and rebroadcast on november mr hasan hüseyin ceylan refah mp for the province of ankara had encouraged discrimination between believers and non-believers and had predicted that if the supporters of applying sharia came to power they would annihilate nonbelievers our homeland belongs to us but not the regime dear brothers the regime and kemalism belong to others turkey will be destroyed gentlemen people say could turkey become like algeria just as in algeria we got of the votes here too we will reach we will not remain on do not waste your energy on us i am speaking here to you to those of the imperialist west the colonising west the wild west to those who in order to unite with the rest of the world become the enemies of honour and modesty those who lower themselves to the level of dogs of puppies in order to imitate the west to the extent of putting dogs between the legs of muslim women it is to you i speak when i say ‘ do not waste your energy on us you will die at the hands of the people of kırıkkale. the army says ‘ we can accept it if you re a supporter of the pkk but a supporter of sharia never. well you won t solve the problem with that attitude if you want the solution it s sharia. refah had ensured that mr ceylan was elected as an mp and its local branches had played videotapes of this speech and the interview refah s vice-chairman mr ahmet tekdal in a speech he made in while on pilgrimage in saudi arabia which was shown by a turkish television station had said that he advocated installing a regime based on sharia in countries which have a parliamentary regime if the people are not sufficiently aware if they do not work hard enough to bring about the advent of ‘ hak nizami a just order or god s order two calamities lie ahead the first calamity is the renegades they will have to face they will be tyrannised by them and will eventually disappear the second calamity is that they will not be able to give a satisfactory account of themselves to allah as they will not have worked to establish ‘ hak nizami and so they will likewise perish venerable brothers our duty is to do what is necessary to introduce the system of justice taking these subtleties into consideration the political apparatus which seeks to establish ‘ hak nizami in turkey is the welfare party. on november the mayor of kayseri mr şükrü karatepe had urged the population to renounce secularism and asked his audience to keep their hatred alive until the regime was changed in the following terms the dominant forces say ‘ either you live as we do or we will sow discord and corruption among you so even welfare party ministers dare not reveal their world-outlook inside their ministries this morning i too attended a ceremony in my official capacity when you see me dressed up like this in all this finery don t think it s because i m a supporter of secularism in this period when our beliefs are not respected and indeed are blasphemed against i have had to attend these ceremonies in spite of myself the prime minister other ministers and mps have certain obligations but you have no obligations this system must change we have waited we will wait a little longer let us see what the future has in store for us and let muslims keep alive the resentment rancour and hatred they feel in their hearts. mr şükrü karatepe had been convicted of inciting the people to hatred on the ground of religion on may mr i̇brahim halil çelik refah mp for the province of şanlıurfa had spoken in parliament in favour of the establishment of a regime based on sharia and approving acts of violence like those which were taking place in algeria if you attempt to close down the ‘ i̇mam-hatip theological colleges while the welfare party is in government blood will flow it would be worse than in algeria i too would like blood to flow that s how democracy will be installed and it will be a beautiful thing the army has not been able to deal with members of the pkk how would it see off six million islamists if they piss into the wind they ll get their faces wet if anyone attacks me i will strike back i will fight to the end to introduce sharia. mr i̇brahim halil çelik had been expelled from the party one month after the application for dissolution had been lodged his exclusion had probably only been an attempt to evade the penalty in question refah s vice-chairman the minister of justice mr şevket kazan had visited a person detained pending trial for activities contrary to the principle of secularism thus publicly lending him his support as a minister on the basis of the evidence adduced on july by principal state counsel s office the constitutional court held that the following further evidence confirmed that refah was a centre of activities contrary to the principle of secularism in a public speech on may mr necmettin erbakan had emphasised the importance of television as an instrument of propaganda in the holy war being waged in order to establish islamic order a state without television is not a state if today with your leadership you wished to create a state if you wanted to set up a television station you would not even be able to broadcast for more than twenty-four hours do you believe it is as easy as that to create a state that s what i told them ten years ago i remember it now because today people who have beliefs an audience and a certain vision of the world have a television station of their own thanks be to god it is a great event conscience the fact that the television channel has the same conscience in all its programmes and that the whole is harmonious is very important a cause can not be fought for without the support of television besides today we can say that television plays the role of artillery or an air force in the jihad that is the war for domination of the people it would be unthinkable to send a soldier to occupy a hill before those forces had shelled or bombed it that is why the jihad of today can not be waged without television so for something so vital sacrifices must be made what difference does it make if we sacrifice money death is close to all of us when everything is dark after death if you want something to show you the way that something is the money you give today with conviction for kanal it was to remind you of that that i shared my memories with you that is why from now on with that conviction we will truly make every sacrifice until it hurts may those who contribute with conviction to the supremacy of hakk allah be happy may allah bless you all and may he grant kanal even more success greetings. by a decree of january the cabinet in which the refah members formed a majority had reorganised working hours in public establishments to make allowances for fasting during ramadan the supreme administrative court had annulled this decree on the ground that it undermined the principle of secularism the constitutional court observed that it had taken into consideration international human-rights protection instruments including the convention it also referred to the restrictions authorised by the second paragraph of article and article of the convention it pointed out in that context that refah s leaders and members were using democratic rights and freedoms with a view to replacing the democratic order with a system based on sharia the constitutional court observed democracy is the antithesis of sharia the principle of secularism which is a sign of civic responsibility was the impetus which enabled the turkish republic to move on from ummah ümmet the muslim religious community to the nation with adherence to the principle of secularism values based on reason and science replaced dogmatic values persons of different beliefs desiring to live together were encouraged to do so by the state s egalitarian attitude towards them secularism accelerated civilisation by preventing religion from replacing scientific thought in the state s activities it creates a vast environment of civic responsibility and freedom the philosophy of modernisation of turkey is based on a humanist ideal namely living in a more human way under a secular regime religion which is a specific social institution can have no authority over the constitution and governance of the state conferring on the state the right to supervise and oversee religious matters can not be regarded as interference contrary to the requirements of democratic society secularism which is also the instrument of the transition to democracy is the philosophical essence of life in turkey within a secular state religious feelings simply can not be associated with politics public affairs and legislative provisions those are not matters to which religious requirements and thought apply only scientific data with consideration for the needs of individuals and societies. the constitutional court held that where a political party pursued activities aimed at bringing the democratic order to an end and used its freedom of expression to issue calls to action to achieve that aim the constitution and supranational human-rights protection rules authorised its dissolution the constitutional court observed that the public statements of refah s leaders namely those of mr necmettin erbakan mr şevket kazan and mr ahmet tekdal had directly engaged refah s responsibility with regard to the constitutionality of its activities it further observed that the public statements made by mps mr şevki yılmaz mr hasan hüseyin ceylan and mr i̇brahim halil çelik and by the mayor of kayseri mr şükrü karatepe had likewise engaged the party s responsibility since it had not reacted to them in any way or sought to distance itself from them or at least not before the commencement of the dissolution proceedings as an additional penalty the constitutional court decided to strip necmettin erbakan şevket kazan ahmet tekdal şevki yılmaz hasan hüseyin ceylan and i̇brahim halil çelik of their mp status in accordance with article of the constitution it found that these persons by their words and deeds had caused refah s dissolution the constitutional court also banned them for five years from becoming founding members ordinary members leaders or auditors of any other political party pursuant to article of the constitution judges haşim kılıç and sacit adalı expressed dissenting opinions stating inter alia that in their view the dissolution of refah was not compatible either with the provisions of the convention or with the caselaw of the european court of human rights on the dissolution of political parties they observed that political parties which did not support the use of violence should be able to take part in political life and that in a pluralist system there should be room for debate about ideas thought to be disturbing or even shocking this judgment was published

the case originated in an application no against the federal republic of germany lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by geotech kancev gmbh the applicant a limited company registered in castrop-rauxel on april the applicant company was represented by ms h. böttcher a lawyer practising in hamburg on march insolvency proceedings were opened over the applicant company s assets the company has not been struck off the commercial register handelsregister the insolvency administrator insolvenzverwalter authorised the applicant s counsel to continue the proceedings before this court the german government the government were represented by their agent mr h.-j behrens ministerialrat of the federal ministry of justice third-party comments were received from the supplementary pension scheme for the construction industry corporation zusatzversorgungskasse des baugewerbes ag zvk which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule of the rules of the court the parties were given an opportunity to reply to those comments rule of the rules of the court the applicant company mainly alleged that its obligation to participate in the social welfare fund jointly set up by the employers associations and the trade union in the building industry violated its right to freedom of association under article of the convention as well as its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions under article of protocol no on june the complaints concerning article of the convention and article of protocol no were communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applicant company specialises in taking soil samples by way of drilling for geological examination inter alia for the purpose of assessing suitability for building sites and for the construction of wells in the building industry in germany a number of collective agreements operated which contained regulations related to the social welfare of employees working in that sector see relevant domestic law and practice paragraphs the employers associations in the building industry hauptverband der deutschen bauindustrie and zentralverband des deutschen baugewerbes and the trade union ig bauen-agrar-umwelt concluded the collective agreement on social welfare proceedings in the building trade tarifvertrag über das sozialkassenverfahren im baugewerbe vtv the vtv contained rules about contributions and entitlements in relation to both the zvk and the holiday and wage equalisation fund of the construction industry urlaubs- und lohnausgleichskasse der bauwirtschaft ulak which jointly comprised the social welfare fund in the building industry which went by the common name soka-bau as the federal ministry for labour and social affairs declared the vtv generally binding allgemeinverbindlich pursuant to section of the law on collective agreements tarifvertragsgesetz it was binding on all employers in the building industry even if they did not belong to the employers association section of the law on collective agreements see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph as a consequence all employers in the building industry were obliged to contribute to the social welfare fund an additional sum amounting to of the gross wages paid to their employees the applicant company was not a member of an employers association that was party to the relevant collective agreements it was thus not directly bound by any collective agreements by virtue of such membership on august the social welfare fund sent a letter to the applicant company with key information about the supplementary welfare schemes including with regard to contributions to be paid and possible benefits it might receive the applicant company did not react to this letter on april following enquiries made in order to establish whether the applicant was obliged to pay contributions the social welfare fund sent a letter to the applicant company informing it about its duty to pay contributions and that an account had been opened into which benefits would be paid on april the applicant company s lawyer sent a letter to the social welfare fund objecting to being registered with the fund on october the wiesbaden labour court ordered the applicant company to pay euros eur in welfare fund arrears for the period between september and march to the zvk the applicant company was further ordered to submit copies of the wage slips issued to its employees between january and june the labour court considered that the applicant company was bound by the vtv which was binding on all employers in the building industry even if they did not belong to one of the employers associations the activities of the applicant company fell within the scope of the vtv which in its article v no listed drilling as an activity within its scope the applicant company lodged an appeal submitting in particular that the generally binding effect of the vtv violated the negative aspects of its right to freedom of association it argued that it was obliged to contribute to a fund jointly set up by the employers association and the trade union even though it did not belong to either of these associations the applicant company further complained that it was prevented from founding its own association due to a lack of funds on june the hesse labour court of appeal rejected the applicant company s appeal and did not grant leave for an appeal on points of law as well as confirming the labour court s reasoning the court of appeal held that the generally binding effect of the vtv did not violate the applicant company s right to freedom of association it observed that the generally binding effect did not entail an obligation to adhere either to one of the employers associations or to the social welfare fund referring to the case-law of the federal constitutional court decision of july bvr see relevant domestic law and practice paragraph the labour court of appeal conceded that the applicant company which was not a member of one of the employers associations had the disadvantage of not being able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of the social welfare fund via these associations the right to participate in the decision-making process within these associations was reserved to members of the respective association in so far as this fact exerted a certain pressure to become a member of one of the employers associations this was however not sufficient to amount to a violation of the negative aspect of its right to freedom of association the court of appeal further considered that the obligation to contribute to the social welfare fund did not prevent the applicant company from founding its own association it observed that the major parts of the contributions due would be reimbursed to the applicant if properly declared the court of appeal finally considered that the obligatory contribution to the social welfare fund took account of the high fluctuation of employees in the building industry and served the public interest of allowing for management of the employee s claims by the social welfare fund thus preventing a distortion of competition on december the federal labour court rejected the applicant company s complaint against the refusal to grant leave to appeal on february the federal constitutional court refused to accept the applicant company s constitutional complaint for adjudication without providing reasons bvr section of the law on collective agreements which constituted the legal basis for declaring collective agreements generally binding and set out the procedure for and effects of such a declaration provided the federal ministry for labour and social affairs may on request and with the consent of a committee consisting of three representatives each of the head organisations of the employers and of the employees declare a collective agreement generally binding if the employees of the employers which are bound by the collective agreement constitute no less than of the employees to which the collective agreement applies and it appears to be in the public interest to grant the agreement binding effect the conditions referred to in numbers and may be waived if the declaration of general applicability appears necessary to rectify a social emergency before taking a decision concerning an application employers and employees who might possibly be affected by the declaration of general applicability the trade unions and employers associations interested in the outcome of the procedure and the highest labour authorities of the länder included in the scope of the collective agreement shall be given the opportunity to submit written statements and to make statements in an oral and public hearing where the highest labour authority of an involved land raises an objection against the declaration of general applicability the federal ministry of labour and social affairs may only grant the application with the prior approval of the federal government in case a collective agreement has been declared generally binding the provisions of that agreement also apply to those employers and employees who had previously not been bound by it the federal ministry of labour and social affairs may revoke the declaration of general applicability of a collective agreement with the consent of the committee referred to in subsection if the revocation appears expedient in the public interest subsections and shall apply mutatis mutandis the federal ministry of labour and social affairs may in individual cases transfer the right to make the declaration of general applicability and to revoke the declaration of general applicability to the highest land labour authority public notification shall be made of the declaration of general applicability and of the revocation of the declaration of general applicability. in the building industry a number of collective agreements operated which contained regulations related to the social welfare of employees in that sector these agreements took account of the specific working conditions in the building industry notably that building work was largely weather-dependent the building industry was subject to considerable fluctuations in orders but production in advance was not possible so that low demand inevitably led to a shortage of orders employee fluctuation between construction companies was generally high and the majority of persons employed in the building industry left the labour force before they reached the age of retirement this resulted in employees in the building industry not being able to fulfil the prerequisites for obtaining social welfare benefits in respect of one single employer in order to protect the employees in the building industry against these disadvantages and to guarantee them certain minimum social welfare benefits supplementary social welfare schemes were introduced through collective agreements the relevant collective agreements were the federal framework collective agreement for the building industry bundesrahmentarifvertrag für das baugewerbe brtv which regulated the entitlement to holiday pay for employees in the construction industry among other things the collective agreement on pension allowances in the building industry rentenbeihilfen im baugewerbe tvr the collective agreement on vocational training in the building industry tarifvertrag über die berufbildung im baugewerbe bbtv and the vtv the holiday fund and the supplementary pension scheme had in common that they eliminated the link to a concrete employment relationship and instead focused on the fact that an employee was a member of a specific sector if an employee moved from one employer in the building industry to another he retained any previously accrued entitlements the employee s periods of employment in various companies in the building industry were added up all employers within the scope of application of the respective generally binding collective agreements were obliged to contribute financially to the said social welfare schemes these contributions were used to reimburse the companies that provided the respective benefits to the employees in other words the employers in the building industry financed the social welfare benefits of the employees in that sector based on the principle of solidarity these social welfare schemes have been implemented in accordance with the respective generally binding collective agreements for several decades the holiday scheme was introduced in the supplementary pension scheme in and the vocational training scheme in in the federal labour court found that declaring the collective agreements on which the social welfare schemes were based generally binding was legal judgments of february azr and azr in the federal constitutional court held that declaring the collective agreements concerning the social welfare fund generally binding did not violate the basic law grundgesetz judgment of july bvr and bvr it found in particular that the pressure on a company to become a member of an association that was party to the respective collective agreements so as to be able to assert its interests by exercising control over the activities of the social welfare schemes via this association did not constitute a violation of the negative aspect of the right to freedom of association the federal constitutional court recently upheld the keynotes of that decision judgment of july bvl finding that a mere incentive to join an association was not sufficient to constitute an interference with the negative aspect of the right to freedom of association the declaration of generally applicability of each of these collective agreements was preceded by the procedure prescribed by section of the law on collective agreements the vtv contained rules about contributions and entitlements in relation to both the zvk and the ulak which jointly comprised the social welfare fund in the building industry which went by the common name soka-bau the zvk and the ulak were responsible for administering and implementing the above-mentioned social welfare schemes as regulated in the respective generally binding collective agreements concluded in the building industry the social welfare fund in the building industry did not establish nor foresee that any employer or employee falling within the scope of the fund became or could become a member of the fund the only members of the zvk were the parties to the respective collective agreements namely the employers associations hauptverband der deutschen bauindustrie and zentralverband des deutschen baugewerbes and the trade union in the building industry ig bauen-agrar-umwelt members of the ulak included in addition regional employers associations at the time relevant for the present case the zvk was responsible for collecting contributions for the holiday scheme for financing pension allowances and for financing sector-wide vocational training in the building industry it was also responsible for administrating the pension allowance scheme the holiday scheme and the vocational training scheme however were administered by the ulak in addition the zvk and the ulak also administered and paid optional benefits to the employers and employees these benefits were not part of the applicable collective agreements and were not financed from the contributions paid in accordance with the vtv from december the social welfare fund operated in the legal form of a stock company before december and at the time relevant to the instant case the zvk was organised as a mutual insurance association versicherungsverein auf gegenseitigkeit a specific legal form in private law available in the area of insurance only the ulak was organised as a commercial association within the meaning of article of the civil code the benefits provided by the zvk constituted an insurance product under domestic law the zvk was thus subject to state insurance supervision by the german federal financial supervisory authority bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin the ulak was likewise subject to state supervision by the state capital of the federal state land of hesse according to their statutes neither the zvk nor the ulak were allowed to realise or to distribute any profits the contributions they received could exclusively be used to administer and to finance social welfare schemes and to pay out the respective benefits profits could only be used to build up reserves whenever a firm registered with the social welfare fund or the social welfare fund learned of the existence of a building company by other means a letter was sent to the company briefly outlining the social welfare schemes including associated reimbursements in addition a brochure containing information about the benefits paid to employees and the reimbursement of employers was enclosed the brochure also provided an overview of the legal bases for the social welfare schemes reference was made to the website www.soka-bau.de and to further information available by telephone or in electronic form if the social welfare fund s enquiries revealed that a company was bound by the respective collective agreements the company received written notification thereof additional information about inter alia the benefits paid by the zvk and the ulak the respective social welfare schemes the tasks of the zvk and the ulak and the use of the financial contributions was enclosed in addition the company was offered a free personal on-site consultation in terms of reporting the zvk and the ulak each provided individual annual reports of their activities and the concrete use to which the contributions they received were put as from they also prepared a joint annual report in addition to the individual reports the zvk s annual report was published in the federal gazette from the annual reports of the zvk and the ulak could also be downloaded from the fund s website companies registered with the social welfare fund received a letter of information as soon as a new annual report had been published these letters did not only indicate the possibility of downloading the annual reports but also contained a form which a firm could use to order printed copies by post the annual reports set out the tasks of the social welfare fund and provided a description of its income and expenditure the respective information was detailed for example for the zvk report as it related to the pension allowance number of pensioners pension payment expenditure average amount of pension allowance year-on-year comparison the reports also featured information on staffing costs of the zvk and the ulak the annual accounts including balance sheets were compiled in accordance with the relevant national provisions and audited by accountants the annual reports showed that the social welfare fund did not make any profit any surpluses generated were primarily used to build up reserves this information was provided to the

the case originated in two applications nos and against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention on august and april respectively the principal applicant in both applications is the united macedonian organisation ilinden party for economic development and integration of the population umo ilinden pirin or the applicant party a political party founded in and dissolved by the in the remaining applicants in the first application are mr ivan iliev singartiyski mr stoyko ivanov stoykov mr angel ivanov bezev and mr botyo vangelov tikov bulgarian nationals born in and and living in musomishta sandanski and koprivlen who are members of the applicant party s governing body and mr stoyan nikolov georgiev a bulgarian national born in and living in petrich who is a member of the party the applicants in the second application are the same as those in the first application save for the sixth applicant the applicants were represented by mr y. grozev a lawyer practising in the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agent ms m. dimova of the ministry of justice the applicants alleged that two refusals of the courts to register the applicant party had infringed their right to freedom of association had deprived them of effective domestic remedies had been discriminatory and had been in breach of the s duty to abide by the final judgment of the court in an earlier case on june the president of the fifth section to which the case had been allocated decided to give priority to the applications under rule of the rules of court and to conduct the proceedings in the case simultaneously with those in united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria no no united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v. bulgaria no no and singartiyski and others v. bulgaria no rule former of the rules of court on september the court decided to join the two applications rule former and to give notice of them to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility article of the convention following the recomposition of the court s sections on february the application was transferred to the fourth section the applicant party based in south-west bulgaria in an area known as the pirin region or the geographic region of pirin was initially founded in it was declared unconstitutional by the on february and as a result dissolved the relevant developments up to february are described in detail in paragraphs of the court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others v. bulgaria no october in that judgment the court found that the applicant party s dissolution had been in breach of article of the convention ibid. after the court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others cited above became final on january the applicant party s followers decided to apply for reregistration of the party considering that this would be the best way of expunging the consequences of the violation of article since under bulgarian law there is no possibility of reopening proceedings before the constitutional court on june in line with the procedure envisaged in the political parties act see paragraph below the party s founding committee published a founding declaration in dnevnik a national newspaper announcing that the party s founding meeting would be held on june the meeting took place as planned on september the applicant party s founders applied to the sofia city court софийски градски съд for registration they enclosed with the application the original of the founding declaration and its published copy a certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the party s name minutes of the founding meeting signed by the meeting s chairman and minutetaker a copy of the party s constitution notarised signature samples of the members of the party s representative body notarised declarations vouching for the authenticity of the lists of the party s founders and members and of its constitution a sample of the party s seal a list of the founders having signed membership declarations and copies of those declarations and a list of the party s members individuals after the application was filed a copy of the list of the party s founding members was apparently made available to the police and the prosecuting authorities in gotse delchev blagoevgrad sandanski petrich and some other localities in the pirin region the police started systematically checking the names the identities and the personal data of the individuals concerned they also summoned a large number of those individuals questioned them about their involvement with the party and obtained from some of them declarations denying any connection with the applicant party following this operation the police drew up a detailed report pointing to a number of alleged irregularities in the party s formation such as failures to indicate the full names full and correct addresses and personal identity numbers of the founders in some membership declarations as well as the facts that some founders were living abroad were members of other parties or were minors or mentally ill it also contained allegations based on interviews with the individuals concerned and other inquiries by the police that they had been put on the list without their knowledge or against the payment of money the police additionally commissioned a graphology expert to check the texts of the membership declarations and the signatures featuring on them on october the expert drew up a detailed report which said that the texts of a number of declarations had been filled in by the same people but that the signatures were those of separate people all of whom he identified by name and citizen identification number he also said that the signatures of thirteen individuals on the membership declarations differed from the corresponding signatures on the list of members the sofia city court examined the application at a hearing held on october a prosecutor of the sofia city prosecutor s office who participated in the proceedings ex officio produced the abovementioned reports orders by the prosecuting authorities in sandanski and gotse delchev for the carrying out of preliminary inquiries and sixtysix declarations obtained during the earlier police operation and purportedly establishing that the individuals who had made them had no links with the applicant party some of the declarations contained the following statements i am not and have never been a member of umo ilinden pirin i made the decision to sign the membership declaration off the top of my head i have not received anything in return and i was not coerced into doing it i declare i have nothing to do with the antibulgarian organisation umo ilinden pirin in no way do i support their separatist ideas the fact that i signed the petition does not in any way mean that i support their ideas i declare that i have never been a member and am not a member of the illegal umo ilinden counsel for the party s founders requested an adjournment to acquaint himself with the newly presented evidence the court turned the request down allowing counsel to peruse the documents during a half-hour recess when the hearing resumed counsel for the party s founders objected to the admission of the two reports in evidence and sought leave to present additional evidence the membership applications of the persons whose names featured in the declarations presented by the prosecutor and the missing personal identity numbers and addresses of the founders the court denied leave saying that the evidence sought to be adduced was not required under the political parties act see paragraphs below it also said that it would rule on the admissibility of the prosecutor s evidence in its judgment in a memorial filed after the hearing the prosecutor argued that the registration request should be rejected as firstly most of the founders had not personally filled in but merely signed their membership declarations as shown by the expert report secondly some of the members of the party s governing bodies featured in the minutes of the founding meeting with two names only which made it difficult to identify them thirdly there was no indication that a properly constituted ballot committee had duly checked the number of participants in the founding meeting all of this showed that the founding meeting had been irregular and its resolutions void moreover the sixtysix declarations showed that a number of the purported founders of the party were in fact no such thing there were also a number of technical irregularities in the founding instruments lastly there were indications that a number of purported founders had agreed to become members without really wanting to or understanding the implications the party had therefore been founded in breach of among other provisions article of the convention which enshrined negative freedom of association in a countermemorial counsel for the party s founders submitted inter alia that the facts the prosecutor sought to prove through the evidence he had adduced could be established only within the framework of separate contentious proceedings noncontentious registration proceedings were not a suitable forum for resolving such issues even if one were to admit that there were certain irregularities in the membership declarations or the lists this was not reason enough to hold that the number of founders had not in fact been attained the sixtysix declarations presented by the prosecutor had to be discounted inter alia because their sincerity was highly doubtful as they appeared to have been made under pressure from the police that could be seen from the content of some of the declarations most of the irregularities noted in the police report were trivial or irrelevant and in view of the limited number of individuals concerned fiftyeight did not cast doubt on the fact that the party had more than five thousand members as required by law lastly there was no indication that the party s formation had been in breach of article of the convention or articles and of the constitution see paragraph below on the contrary it was consonant with the court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others cited above in a judgment of october the sofia city court refused to enter the applicant party in the register of political parties it held as follows in an application of september the applicants ivan iliev singartiyski stoyko ivanov stoykov angel ivanov bezev and botyo vangelov tikov asked this court to enter in the register of political parties the newly founded party umo ilinden pirin the certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the name issued by the registry of the sofia city court shows that it was issued for a political party named united macedonian organisation ilinden party for economic development and integration of the population a founding declaration has been produced as required under section of the political parties act however it can not be individualised as there is no information in the file about the ‘ initiative committee of ‘ at least enfranchised bulgarian citizens who have adopted it as required under subsection of this section the declaration says that they are ‘ a group but the evidence does not allow the court to ascertain their number the declarations under section of the same act do not contain information about the membership of the initiative committee i.e such declarations are lacking it can be seen from the enclosed minutes of june that on that date a founding meeting of the ‘ political party umo ilinden pirin was held at the beginning of the meeting a ballot committee was elected whose membership can not be ascertained as the individuals mentioned feature with their first and family names only and there is no further information about them in addition there is no report by this committee relating its findings which are mentioned only in the minutes the individualisation of persons with two names only also affects the procedures for electing a leadership a central council and an audit committee the citizen identification numbers of the members are not set out either an uncertified copy of the party s constitution has been produced it is not clear whether this is the constitution that was adopted at the founding meeting or the constitution mentioned in the notarised declaration vouching for its authenticity no graphic depictions of the symbols of the party have been submitted they have merely been described in clause of the constitution ‘ the party s flag is red with a golden sun and a golden inscription ‘ umo ilinden pirin and the party s sign comprising two pirin mountain peaks with a sun rising between them yellow with a blue background with a white edelweiss at the foot of the hills lists and declarations of the founding members said by the applicants to be in number have been presented as required under section and in conjunction with section of the political parties act the expert report presented by the sofia city prosecutor s office shows that of the declarations were filled in by the same persons so that it is logical to conclude that founding members did not personally fill in their declarations as required by law the report was contested by counsel for the applicants the court gives credence to this piece of evidence as handwriting recognition demands special skills and although it is clear to the naked eye that the declarations in volume pages to of the case file have been filled in with the same handwriting the court itself would not be able to make legally binding findings on this point because this requires special qualifications and skills which are in the experts province the court also gives credence to the expert report because it was made by the ministry of internal affairs institute of forensic science and criminology bears the institute s seal and the signature of dr s.b head of the ‘ documentary offences photography and phonoscopy department and is thus an official document the court does not take into account the individual declarations presented by the sofia city prosecutor s office although they tend to show that the procedure for the formation of the party was not especially perfect as correctly argued by counsel for the applicants in his brief their number could not influence the number of the party s members required under section of the political parties act the presented list of the party s members is inaccurate and incorrect for instance in volume one of the evidence pages and the names of persons are listed but without saying for what purpose their names and personal data are listed pages to listing persons are presented as an uncertified copy and do not make it clear for what purpose the names and personal data are given pages to and to concerning people are presented in an uncertified copy on page there are two persons with incomplete addresses page features one person identified by his first name only without a citizen identification number and address the same on pages and and so on on the basis of these findings of fact the court makes the following findings of law the application was made under article of the code of civil procedure in conjunction with section of the political parties act and has given rise to noncontentious proceedings in such proceedings the registering court must check whether the application is formally valid and whether it is wellfounded article of the code governs the registration of all types of legal persons which by law are required to be registered by a court according to section of the act a political party is registered in the special register kept by the sofia city court on the basis of a special application by its representative body to determine whether the application is wellfounded the registering court has to check whether the facts sought to be registered are indeed subject to registration and whether they have validly taken place the application is admissible as it was filed by the members of the leadership of the political party umo ilinden pirin who according to clause of its constitution represent it and are therefore the proper applicants the application is unfounded for the following reasons section of the political parties act provides that each enfranchised bulgarian citizen may join the subscription up until the founding meeting by personally filling in and signing an individual membership declaration based on a model adopted by the initiative committee through this declaration the citizens express their personal wish to be members of the political party and declare that they accept its main principles and goals as set out in its founding declaration and that they are not members of another political party the members of the initiative committee must also fill in such a declaration for a valid membership to arise there must be ‘ an initiative of at least enfranchised bulgarian citizens who form an initiative committee which adopts the founding declaration to be signed by the founders a founding declaration has been produced but the available evidence does not show that the initiative committee consists of at least bulgarian citizens the expression ‘ group of citizens used in the declaration page of the case file does not establish the characteristics of these individuals enfranchised bulgarian citizens and thus the quorum required under section of the political parties act moreover section of the same act expressly requires the initiative committee to fill in the declaration as well this court does not find it established that this formality which is a necessary prerequisite for membership has been completed even assuming that the founding declaration is in compliance with the law the model declaration adopted by the initiative committee should still be filled in and signed personally section of the political parties act at least of the submitted declarations have not been filled in personally i.e one of the two cumulative prerequisites mandatory under the law has not been complied with the court would not comment on the authenticity of the signatures about which there are doubts the expert report says that there are differences between the signatures of the same persons in the declarations and in the lists featuring their names this logically leads to the conclusion that there are only proper founding declarations in breach of the requirements of section subsections and of the political parties act the above shows that the founding meeting was attended by far fewer than founders and that there has been no valid adoption of the party s constitution as required under section of the abovementioned act a quorum is established on the basis of these very founding declarations as there is no legal requirement for each founder to personally fill in his name and personal data in the lists it can be seen from the founding meeting s minutes that a ballot committee was elected but it did not draw up a report the minutes feature only the first and the family names of its members and for this reason they can not be identified nor their responsibility engaged this is why the court can not find that the statement in the minutes that a quorum was attained does not need to be proven a quorum establishes lawful representation it is a prerequisite for a collective body validly to adopt resolutions each of the members is bound to all the others who have agreed to the party s constitution this instrument binds the members of a legal person to act in a certain way in pursuit of common goals a legal person s resolutions are legal acts emanating from its bodies and entailing legal consequences for all members of a given community a necessary prerequisite for the adoption of resolutions by collective bodies in the instant case a political party is the quorum the mandatory number of persons corresponding to the requirements of the political parties act of bulgarian citizens who have capacity to act who are not disenfranchised and who have to be present to adopt a valid resolution to be legitimate resolutions of collective bodies have to comprise a certain number of identical acts by persons having capacity to act the lack of the legally required quorum leads to resolutions which have not been adopted by consensus from a legal point of view the entire procedure for duly forming a legal person has been vitiated the presence of this defect is in itself sufficient to deny the political party registration moreover it can not be made good without calling and holding a new founding meeting to achieve precision and give full reasons for its ruling this court considers that the remaining circumstances required for the lawful formation of a legal person must be analysed as well it is questionable whether the applicants have adduced in evidence a constitution the enclosed copy of a constitution is not certified and there is no indication that it is indeed the authentic constitution of the party as claimed in the notarised declaration of its central council section of the political parties act enumerates the minimum contents of each party s constitution the name the symbols the seat the goals the rules governing its organisation and activities the manner of becoming a member and ceasing to be one the rights and the obligations of the members and the manner in which the party is to be wound up the party s name or acronym can not match those of another party nor is it possible to supplement these with words letters figures numbers or other signs section bars parties from using in their symbols the coat of arms or the flag of the or another state or religious signs and images in this connection the court must verify compliance with both the political parties act and mutatis mutandis the applicable provisions of the nonprofit legal persons act as stated in paragraph of the concluding provisions of the political parties act concerning the name a certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the name united macedonian organisation ilinden party for economic development and integration of the population has been presented this name has been written this way only in the founding declaration published in the newspaper dnevnik and in clause of the constitution everywhere else in all evidence the name features as umo ilinden pirin counsel for the applicants says on page of his brief that ‘ there is a separate organisation umo ilinden which although having similar ideas to those of umo ilinden pirin is a separate organisation it can be seen from clause of the constitution that the abbreviated version of the name will be written on the party s symbol its flag and will also appear on the party s seal however this name is contrary to section subsections and of the nonprofit legal persons act which provides that ‘ the name must clearly show the legal person s type and that it ‘ must not be misleading there is a discrepancy between the unique name featuring on the sofia city court s certificate and the name used in the evidence the shortened name could confuse third parties firstly because it concerns ‘ a separate organisation umo ilinden secondly because the acronym pirin could be wrongly deciphered and finally because a clear indication of the legal person s type is missing concerning the symbols the failure to produce the graphic depictions of the symbols described in clause of the constitution precludes a categorical conclusion about their conformity with the law the seal however shows that the ‘ sun mentioned in clause is in fact the sixteenray stylised star known as the star of vergina or the star of kutlesh it was discovered during archaeological excavations in the vicinity of the village of vergina formerly kutlesh in northern greece and was depicted on the golden larnax found in by professor manolis andronikos in a royal tomb dating from the time of ancient macedonia professor andronikos described the symbol as a ‘ star a ‘ starburst or a ‘ sunburst following the discovery of the larnax box the star of vergina was widely adopted by greeks as a symbol of continuity between ancient macedonian culture and modern nowadays the symbol is popular in the star of vergina on a blue background is commonly used as an official emblem of the three peripheries the prefectures and the municipalities of the region of thus the blue flag with the star of vergina appeared in the the symbol was also adopted by the large macedonian diaspora and later after the disintegration of yugoslavia the independent displayed the star of vergina on its new flag the star of vergina became a source of controversies both within the republic of macedonia and in its relations with neighbouring the flag a red rectangle with the star in the middle became a major issue and the subject of extensive political discussions between the two sides greek objections led to the flag being banned from use in a variety of international organisations including the united nations the olympic games and the representations of the republic of macedonia in the united states of america and in february the greek parliament adopted a declaration designating the star of vergina as an official greek national symbol in july lodged a request with the world intellectual property organization wipo for exclusive intellectual property rights to the star of vergina from a legal standpoint the symbols described in clause of the party s constitution are contrary to section of the political parties act concerning the rules governing the organisation and the activities of the political party the political parties act does not lay down detailed regulations for this type of legal person this calls for subsidiary application of the nonprofit legal persons act political parties are subject to all rules in chapters i and ii concerning the types of legal persons and more specifically part one concerning associations as well as in chapter iii concerning associations acting in the public interest in assessing the rules governing the party s organisation and activities the court must equally take into account the provisions of the constitution which lay down guiding principles which are relevant for the specific areas of legal regulation or for the activities of those subject to the law each corporate legal person has internal rules and they are one of its essential characteristics the enclosed constitution sets out the main structures of the party and their manner of operation the supreme body is the national conference consisting of delegates clause elected by the local sections clause the calling of the meetings of this body is entrusted to the central council which is in turn summoned by the leadership or on the motion of half of its members the founders intentionally avoided a clear exposition of the manner in which the national conference may be called with a view to preventing disputes on this point the question of delegates is not well regulated in terms of what the delegate quota is or what part of the membership nor which delegates have been duly elected nor is it clear on the basis of what principle the central council fixes the territory of each section clause of the constitution this in practice prevents the court from exercising the judicial scrutiny required by section and of the nonprofit legal persons act of the lawfulness of the supreme body s resolutions and their conformity with the party s constitution pursuant to applications made under section of the same act by the party s members and bodies or by the public prosecutor in such proceedings the court must of necessity review the procedure for calling a meeting of the party s bodies and must determine its lawfulness the nonprofit legal persons act provides that there must be a possibility of calling a meeting of the governing body on the direct initiative of one-third of the association s members where such a meeting has not been called the act lays down a judicial procedure for calling a meeting of this body pursuant to a written request by the members the applicant party s constitution does not provide for such a possibility in his memorial counsel for the applicants says that ‘ the registration of the party umo ilinden pirin would be in execution of a judgment of october of the european court of human rights which became final on january and in which the european court analysed in detail all aspects of umo ilinden pirin s activities prior to its dissolution and held that the party s dissolution had been unlawful as it was contrary to the essential principles of freedom of association in their memorial the sofia city prosecutor s office submit that the breaches of articles and of the constitution have been unequivocally established those provisions lay down the principle that parties facilitate the formation and the expression of the political will of the citizens who have the right to freely associate the prosecuting authorities argue that the evidence shows the applicant party is not based on the free will of the citizens but that some have been made members against their will or without being aware for what purpose they had filled in declarations i.e without information and in this sense ‘ the party in issue is not based on the free will of the citizens nor does it form or express their political will in the prosecutor s office s view the facts point to a breach of article of the convention which when providing that everyone has the right to freedom of association ‘ undoubtedly intends this to depend on the free will of the individual not on the decisions of others to include him in a specific association in this case a political party article h of the code of civil procedure provides that the judgments of the european court of human rights may constitute grounds for reopening domestic proceedings which have ended in a final judgment however it is clear that the situation in the case at hand does not fall within the ambit of that provision a fortiori the violations found by the european court of human rights should not be allowed to occur in pending proceedings because the possibility that the final decision which is the ultimate goal of a set of proceedings will be set aside would render these proceedings meaningless the convention has precedence over domestic national legislation that contravenes it article of the constitution it should however not run counter to the present wording of the constitution this is because article until of the constitution provides that the concluding of international treaties requiring amendments to the constitution has to be preceded by such amendments this follows from the reasons given by the in its decision no of july the european court is not competent to give instructions to the states to take specific measures to comply with their obligations under the convention see the judgments in the cases of corigliano v. italy december series a no castells v. spain april series a no bozano v. france december series a no etc the european court s judgments analyse a specific case whether specific facts amount to a violation of the convention for this reason the court does not consider that those judgments may directly determine the outcome of a future case the instant judgment is based on new facts and evidence gathered in line with the requirements of the code of civil procedure in the present proceedings in other words only the principles emerging from the european court s judgments are binding and the applicants can not request automatic registration merely because their fundamental rights have been restricted in the past for which they have been awarded just satisfaction in conclusion freedom of association is guaranteed by the constitution but only if the legal requirements for association in its various forms under the companies act the nonprofit legal persons act and the political parties act have been complied with in view of the foregoing the court finds that the political party has not been duly formed and for this reason its application for registration is to be denied as unfounded. on november the applicants appealed to the supreme court of cassation върховен касационен съд they argued inter alia that the admission of the expert report in evidence had been a serious breach of the rules of procedure as any doubts about the authenticity or the probative value of the documents submitted in support of the registration request should have been resolved in separate contentious proceedings the sofia city court s denial of leave to the applicants to adduce further evidence had also been in breach of the rules of procedure had rendered the proceedings unfair and had prevented them from proving they had complied with the requirements of the political parties act these procedural errors had had a material impact on the sofia city court s findings of fact furthermore that court s ruling that membership declarations must be filled in by the member in person was too rigid and unduly restrictive of the freedom of association of the party s founders after hearing the appeal on february in a final judgment of february реш № от февруари г. по т. д № г. вкс i т о the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia city court s judgment in the following terms this court considers that the sofia city court erred by admitting in evidence the expert report contested by the applicants this report is in fact a private expert report and not an official document as wrongly held by the sofia city court this entailed a breach of the rules of evidence however that breach was not material as it was not the only ground which led to the sofia city court s refusal to register the party that court found that the produced founding declaration the first element of the complex of events leading to a political party s formation was vitiated the founding declaration can not be individualised as it does not emanate from at least fifty enfranchised bulgarian citizens as required by the law section of the political parties act but from a ‘ group of citizens and that ‘ group of citizens can not be individualised nor their number ascertained there is no information in declarations under section of the same act about the size and the membership of the initiative committee because such declarations are lacking therefore the sofia city court s decisive conclusion that the applicant party was not validly formed was based on lapses in the founding declaration presented which fails to meet the imperative requirements of the law sections and of the political parties act the incompleteness of the lists noted by the sofia city court was an additional and not a decisive ground for the refusal and for this reason its being based on a breach of the rules of procedure is not material and does not vitiate the impugned judgment by the same token this court finds unavailing the arguments in the appeal about the rigid application of the rule in section of the act in relation to the handwritten declarations which allegedly led to a restriction of the exercise of basic political rights section s requirement for a personally filled in and signed declaration does not restrict or discriminate against illiterate or blind individuals as the law deals with such eventualities in article of the code of civil procedure which is also applicable in the instant proceedings if the law requires personally filled in and signed declarations under section of the political parties act the court is bound to apply it correctly and uniformly article of the above code the sofia city court did precisely that therefore the complaints that it erred in the application of section of the act are unfounded the complaints that the sofia city court breached the rules of procedure by refusing the applicants leave to adduce further evidence rectifying the irregularities in the initially submitted documents such as wrong or incomplete addresses citizen identification numbers and proof of the truth of circumstances required by law to be declared are unfounded it is true that the proceedings are noncontentious and that the court has to check of its own motion whether the prerequisites for issuing the decision sought are in place it is also true that the court may of its own motion gather evidence and instruct the applicants to produce evidence in corroboration of their claims article of the code of civil procedure however the instant case concerns omissions of the founders which may not be rectified subsequently the complaints that the impugned judgment was wrong on the merits are likewise unfounded as already noted the requirement of section of the political parties act that the declarations be personally filled in and signed is a requirement of the law and the court is bound to apply the law as it is correctly and uniformly article of the abovementioned code regardless of what has been said above this court reiterates that the decisive ground for refusing registration stems from the vitiated declaration of the founding committee found defective partly because of the lack of declarations personally made by the party s members the lack of such declarations and the vitiated lists and the ensuing lack of proof that the meeting had a quorum are thus not in themselves independent grounds for a refusal the lack of graphic symbols and of a report of the ballot committee are not independent grounds for the refusal either they were noted by the sofia city court in addition to its decisive conclusion about the lack of a founding declaration it is a separate issue that the sofia city court found further omissions in the party s formation which were not mentioned or commented upon in the appeal in view of the foregoing and having dealt with all grounds of appeal raised by the applicants this court finds that the sofia city court s conclusions that the applicant party was not validly formed and that its registration request was unfounded are correct for this reason the impugned judgment is to be upheld on november a few days after the sofia city court gave its judgment there was a meeting in between the macedonian and bulgarian ministers of foreign affairs the news agencies reported that during the meeting bulgaria s then foreign minister mr ivaylo kalfin said t he judgment of the european court of human rights in strasbourg does not entail the registration of a party was ordered to pay a fine it paid it and there are no further legal consequences i believe that has fully executed the prescriptions of the and there are no outstanding matters in november the group of the greens/european free alliance in the european parliament proposed an amendment to the report on bulgaria s accession to the european union suggesting that it should include text calling on the bulgarian authorities to prevent any further obstruction to the registration of the political party of the ethnic macedonians and to put an end to all forms of discrimination and harassment visàvis that minority a number of bulgarian observer members of the european parliament objected to that amendment the political party attack атака proposed a draft declaration to be adopted by bulgaria s national assembly and saying that the proposal of the group of the greens was a gross provocation and amounted to meddling in the country s internal affairs attack s leader mr volen siderov was reported by the press to have said on november that he saw a problem in the fact that umo ilinden pirin s registration request had been turned down by the courts on technical grounds in his view umo ilinden ha d to be rejected because of their separatism and anticonstitutional activities not because of formalities in a statement published on november a member of bulgaria s parliament for blagoevgrad said that t he bulgarian court showed that no macedonian parties may be registered in and in a country ruled by law judicial decisions have to be complied with. in early july the second applicant mr singartiyski and another member of the applicant party approached in turn the mayors of the towns of gotse delchev and sandanski with requests to rent a municipal hall in which to hold the party s founding meeting after initially showing willingness to accommodate their request in a letter of july the mayor of gotse delchev turned it down saying that the hall in question did not meet the safety requirements set by the local fire department the mayor of sandanski did not reply to the request the applicant party s founders then decided to hold the founding meeting outdoors it took place on july in the area popovi livadi located in the territory of the according to the applicants it was attended by six hundred and eightyfive people all of whom filled in declarations stating that they wished to join umo ilinden pirin on july the applicant party applied for registration to the sofia city court it presented the founding declaration the minutes of the founding meeting the party s constitution membership declarations signed by six hundred and eighty-five founding members a list of those founding members the list of members compiled in see paragraph above and a notarised declaration of the members of the party s management body to the effect that those lists were authentic it also produced a copy of a letter of july from the committee of ministers secretariat to the permanent representative of to the council of europe the sofia city court examined the application at a hearing held on august the prosecutor who was present ex officio argued that the application should be refused because the party s goals were not those of a political party but rather those of an ordinary association he also said that the list of members was not authentic as it was the same as the one presented in the previous reregistration proceedings and that the minutes of the founding meeting had not been signed by all six hundred and eightyfive persons present in a judgment of august the sofia city court refused the application in the following terms in the course of the proceedings the court noted that the applicants have not complied with the requirements of the political parties act whose section provides that a political party can be founded on the initiative of at least fifty enfranchised bulgarian citizens who have to form an initiative committee this committee has to adopt a written founding declaration the founding declaration of july presented was signed by seventysix people who did not however personally fill in and sign declarations under section of the above act moreover according to section of this act the declaration has to be drawn up by the initiative committee since evidence to that effect has not been produced the court can not be certain that this initiative committee has indeed held meetings and that such resolutions have in fact been adopted the minutes of the founding meeting of july say that it was attended by adult bulgarian citizens who had personally filled in and signed declarations under section of the above act the court fails to see how it was possible to obtain declarations by adult enfranchised bulgarian citizens in less than fifteen days that is from the committee s declaration of july to july so as to allow the holding of the founding meeting on july it is true that section of the act provides that a political party is formed at a founding meeting held in the not later than three months after the date on which the founding declaration has been adopted however in the instant case the court can not accept that people who had personally filled in their declarations under section of the act were able to get together to hold a founding meeting in such a short time moreover the minutes are signed by the president of the meeting and the minutetaker whereas they should have been personally signed by all founders as noted above there is no evidence under section of the act that the initiative committee has adopted a model declaration whereby each enfranchised bulgarian citizen may by personally filling it in and signing it join the party this declaration has to be ready before the holding of the founding meeting it should contain the information required under section of the act the presented lists of three names citizen identification numbers and addresses do not demonstrate to the court that the persons who feature thereon are members of the party as the lists are not accompanied by personally filled in and signed declarations see the presented list of party founders this court does not know whether these persons are aware that they are members of this party or whether this is simply a list intending to prove before the court that the requirements of section of the act have been complied with it must here be noted that the court received from the ministry of justice a letter informing it that the ministry had received a letter from the head of the department for the execution of the judgments of the european court of human rights ms m. in which she asked whether it was possible for the court to accept when examining the application for the applicant party s registration the list of members presented in the previous registration proceedings in which the court whose judgment was upheld by the supreme court of cassation refused to register the party this letter leads the court to conclude that the list produced in the instant proceedings is the same as the one presented in the previous registration proceedings the use of the same list is in breach of articles and of the constitution which provide that parties facilitate the formation and expression of the political will of citizens who may freely associate each application for inclusion in the register of political parties means first sharing the ideas of a group of enfranchised citizens who use democratic ways and means for attaining their political goals set out in the political party s platform and second that the party s formation resolutions and activity should be in conformity with the law the use of the same evidence in separate cases can not therefore be accepted by the court the evidence presented in the previous registration proceedings can not be used in the instant proceedings the presented constitution of the party does not make clear its political goals and tasks the ones mentioned in clauses and of the constitution do not characterise the organisation as a political party within the meaning of the political parties act and the constitution political parties are citizens organisations through which they take part in the political life of the the thing which sets them apart from other citizens associations is according to article of the constitution that only they may pursue political goals or carry out political activities these activities are defined by article of the constitution and section of the political parties act as ones facilitating the formation of the citizens political will which is the citizens will to participate in government the carrying out of political activities is the main criterion for distinguishing political parties from other citizens associations in this connection it should be observed that in their constitutions political parties must clearly declare their goals and tasks and the ways of attaining them the goals and tasks outlined in the applicant party s constitution are limited have an optional character and do not comply with the abovementioned requirements for the court the goals set out in clause of the constitution are rather those of a nonprofit association not of a political party it should also be noted that a political party bearing the same name and having the same goals was registered by the sofia city court in a judgment of february after that in the declared that party unconstitutional and it was struck out of the register the constitutional court s judgment shows that not only the name and the political goals of this party are identical to those stated by the applicants in the instant proceedings but that the party s leadership consists of the same individuals the court can not therefore be sure that having the same political goals and leaders the party will not meet the same fate that is be faced with an application for its banning to the constitutional court the court observes that the constitutionality of a political party must be judged on the basis of its activities the political goals set out in clause of the constitution show that this is a party which is active in a specific part of the territory of the republic of bulgaria which runs counter to both the political parties act and the constitution see clause points and of the party s constitution moreover clause point of the political goals of the party mentions good neighbourly relations in the balkans in europe and in all countries inhabited by ethnic macedonians there is no distinct macedonian ethnos in the the same goes for the party s name to enter a party in the register this court requires precise and clear political goals as well as ways and means of attaining them moreover a party must produce in evidence at least personally filled in and signed declarations under section of the political parties act fully to convince the court that these citizens are truly aware that they are members of a specific political party that they share its political goals express their personal will to be its members and declare that they accept the party s main principles and goals as set out in its founding declaration and that they are not members of another political party these requirements apply without exception to all political parties for these reasons the applicant party s application must be rejected and the court refuses to enter it in the special register. on august the applicant party appealed to the supreme court of cassation in a brief filed on september it argued inter alia that its registration would be consonant with the court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others cited above in that connection it made reference to the relevant decisions of the council of europe s committee of ministers after hearing the appeal on october in a final judgment of october реш № от октомври г. по т. д № г. вкс iі т о the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia city court s judgment in the following terms the impugned judgment is correct and is to be upheld having reviewed the evidence in the case this court finds that the refusal to register the applicant party was lawful section of the political parties act contains an exhaustive list of the documents which need to be filed with the court for the registration of an association of bulgarian citizens founded for the purpose of forming and expressing the people s political will through elections or through other democratic means section of the act this court finds that by presenting a list of members which was compiled during a previous founding meeting of the applicant party and was produced in the previous proceedings for its registration the applicants in the instant case failed to comply with the requirements of section of the act t he reason why the law requires a minimum number of documents to be produced for the registration of a political party is to allow the registering court to check whether the procedure for its formation has been followed and whether it has the minimum number of members to guarantee that it can be a real player on the political scene whose goals as endorsed by its members have public significance and warrant its existence on the country s political scene the case file of the previous registration proceedings has not been enclosed with the present case file but the possible similarity or even match between the goals and the principles adopted at that previous founding meeting and those laid down in the party s constitution produced in the instant proceedings can not warrant the conclusion that the list produced in the course of the previous registration proceedings shows that the requisite number of members of the party seeking registration has really been attained the underlying idea of the abovecited provision is doubtlessly to ensure that the required number of members who have declared their wish to join the effort to attain the goals set out in the party s constitution adopted at the same founding meeting has really been attained from this vantage point the list of members compiled during a previous founding of the party does not serve the law s purpose the membership of an organisation including a political one is a dynamic value which may increase but also decrease due to changes in political views something characteristic of every individual this dynamic which doubtlessly also reflects natural biological processes requires the founders to establish before the registering court the requisite number of members at the time of the party s founding or at the time when the application for its registration is lodged it is obvious that in the instant case those requirements of section have not been complied with owing to the lack of information about the number of persons who have expressed their wish to become members of the applicant party and work for the attainment of its goals as agreed at the founding meeting held on july and laid down in the constitution adopted by the founders the rule in section of the political parties act is imperative failure to comply with even one of its requirements constitutes sufficient grounds to refuse registration as the impugned judgment did since this court shares the final conclusions at which that judgment arrived it considers that it should be upheld. on october umo ilinden pirin held a national conference on the same day the second third fourth fifth and sixth applicants lodged with the sofia city court a request for amendments in the party s registration the request was based on the premise that since this court had found the dissolution of the party in to be in breach of article of the convention the party had never ceased to exist the sofia city court held a hearing on december on december apparently treating the request as a normal registration request it turned it down it found that the party s founders had not enclosed all the necessary documents such as a founding declaration individual membership declarations personally signed by the founders and notarised samples of the signatures of the party s representatives showing that the party had been duly formed it went on to say that this court s judgment in the case of united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others cited above had no bearing on the registration proceedings and could not serve as grounds for finding that the party had never ceased to exist the second applicant mr singartiyski appealed on points of law he argued that the sofia city court had erred by not giving umo ilinden pirin the opportunity to produce all the elements missing from its founding process the court s failure to do so coupled with its ensuing refusal to register the party had been in breach of bulgaria s obligation to abide by this court s judgment in united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others cited above and to heed the instructions given in that connection by the council of europe s committee of ministers after hearing the appeal on may in a final judgment of may реш № от май г. по гр д № г. вкс i т о the supreme court of cassation upheld the sofia city court s judgment in the following terms the subjective registration right is the legally guaranteed possibility to request facts which are subject to registration and the changes in such facts to be entered in the relevant register concrete rights and duties in that respect can arise and evolve only in the manner envisaged by the special statutes governing such matters in the case at hand the political parties act lays down certain requirements which need to be met before an application to register a political party can succeed one of those requirements is the obligation under section of the act for the applicants to enclose certain documents with their application those documents must be produced in order to allow the registering court to ascertain whether the application is admissible and wellfounded it is the applicants duty to produce them and they directly relate to the ascertaining of a series of legal acts leading to the formation of a political party therefore the making of an irregular application such irregularity stemming from a failure to produce the enclosures required by law is tantamount to a failure to comply with the duty to make a proper application moreover some of the irregularities can not be rectified in the manner and timelimits envisaged by article of the code of civil procedure because they are indicative of such failures of the party s founders as make the application for its registration illfounded although noncontentious proceedings follow the general rules of civil procedure their specificity requires the court to assess whether the irregularities in the application can be rectified and thus make the application successful because the law requires all prerequisites for the registration of a political party to be in place the lack of even one such prerequisite makes the application illfounded in the case at hand the lower court found that the imperative requirements of the law had not been complied with there is no founding declaration that declaration has not been published in a daily newspaper as required by section the political parties act the mandatory requirements of sections and of that act have not been complied with although in their appeal the applicants said that they were ready to adduce fresh evidence the above defects can not be rectified in the manner and within the timelimit envisaged by article of the code of civil procedure because they presuppose the occurring of concrete facts at the time when the party was being founded they thus relate to the application s wellfoundedness not to its admissibility besides mr tikov s assertion at the hearing on december that the applicants do not have any documents other than those already produced leads directly to the conclusion that the appeal is illfounded because it conflicts with the applicants position before the lower court where they had to make the requisite procedural steps therefore the lower court has not breached the rules of procedure and has correctly assessed the application s wellfoundedness based on the enclosures submitted by the applicants the appellants argued that the above-mentioned breach of the rules of procedure was directly related to the bulgarian authorities obligation in cooperation with the council of europe s committee of ministers to determine appropriate ways of ‘ registering the political party ‘ umo ilinden pirin they maintained that the bulgarian government was bound to execute the european court of human rights judgment of october as that judgment had still not been executed it was necessary to take individual measures allowing the political party to be registered the applicants position was that the sofia city court s refusal to register the party was in breach of the european court of human rights judgment and the mandatory instructions of the council of europe s committee of ministers the complaint is illfounded the european court of human rights judgment of october related as correctly pointed out by the sofia city court to a breach of article of the european convention on human rights flowing from the constitutional court s finding in its judgment of february that the political party umo ilinden pirin was unconstitutional that has no bearing on the case at hand because the refusal to register the party was based on its failure to comply with the formal requirements of the political parties act those requirements apply to all not only to the appellant therefore the lower court was right to conclude that the european court of human rights judgment is irrelevant to the registration request in the case at hand one of the main principles of the law of registration flowing directly from article of the constitution is the principle of lawfulness it requires the authorities examining registration requests to comply strictly with their duties and requires those who lodge registration requests to comply strictly with theirs the application of that principle is guaranteed by the strict rules governing the facts which need to be registered the manner of their registration the possibility of appealing against the rulings of the registering authorities and the sanctions for failures to comply with registration obligations therefore the ones responsible for complying with registration obligations are the applicants regardless of their identity and not other persons and their failure to do so leads to a refusal to register the requested fact. during its meeting on and june the committee of ministers noted the continuing problems with the registration of the party and invited its secretariat to examine in cooperation with the bulgarian authorities and the applicants the avenues at the applicants disposal with a view to obtaining the party s registration cm/del/dec during its meeting held on october the committee of ministers took note of the complaints of the applicants in the case of umo ilinden pirin concerning the outcome of the new proceedings concerning the registration of the political party noted the different problems still raised by the issue of the individual measures in the latter case and invited the bulgarian authorities in cooperation with the secretariat to examine possible solutions to these problems within the framework of the bulgarian legal order cm/del/dec the committee of ministers concluded the examination of application no united macedonian organisation ilinden pirin and others v. bulgaria during its meeting on december by adopting resolution cm/resdh the relevant parts of which read recalling that the violation of the convention found by the court in this case concerns an infringement of the freedom of association of an organisation which aims to achieve ‘ the recognition of the macedonian minority in bulgaria due to the dissolution in of its political party based on considerations of national security alleged separatist ideas when the applicants had not hinted at any intention to use violence or other undemocratic means to achieve their aims violation of article see details in appendix recalling that a finding of violations by the court requires over and above the payment of just satisfaction awarded by the court in its judgments the adoption by the respondent state where appropriate of individual measures to put an end to the violations and erase their consequences so as to achieve as far as possible restitutio in integrum and of general measures preventing similar violations recalling that the obligation of the respondent state regarding the individual measures in this case implies allowing the applicants to ask for a new registration of their political party in the framework of proceedings which are in accordance with the requirements of the convention and in particular of article for further details see the information document cm/inf/dh recalling that following the court s judgment the applicants requested on three occasions before the domestic courts the registration of their political party and that the committee of ministers followed the proceedings in question up to their outcome recalling that it has expressed concerns more particularly as regard the fact that the decision of the firstinstance court on the second request for registration of the applicants political party reiterated grounds incriminated by the court stressing in this respect that the judicial decisions relating to the applicants third request for registration do not reiterate such grounds and are exclusively based on the noncompliance with the law of the material acts for the constitution of the party and of the related documents to be submitted having noted with satisfaction the declaration of the government according to which it ‘ sees no obstacle to the applicants obtaining the registration of their organisation as a political party on the condition that the requirements of the constitution of the state and the formal requirements of the political parties act are met without any grounds such as those incriminated by the european court being opposed to the applicants underlining in this context that the political parties act as modified in january reduced from to the level of members required to form a political party and that this new level seems in addition likely to resolve the problems encountered by the applicants in forming their party in conformity of the requirement of the political parties act having considered that in view of the above considerations it seems that the applicants can at present apply for the registration of their party in proceedings which are in conformity with article of the convention having examined also the general measures and in particular the awarenessraising measures taken by the bulgarian authorities to ensure that applicable domestic law is interpreted in conformity with the convention and thus to prevent violations similar to that found by the european court see details in appendix noting that the government undertook to continue to organise awarenessraising activities in the field of application of article of the convention including visits to the council of europe of judges in particular from the competent courts having satisfied itself that the respondent state paid the applicants the just satisfaction provided in the judgment see details in appendix declares having examined the measures taken by the respondent state see appendix that it has exercised its functions under article of the convention in this case and decides to close the examination of this case. in an appendix to the resolution the committee described the developments set out in paragraphs above the amendment to the political parties act reducing the membership requirement for a party from five to two and a half thousand members see paragraph below and the government s declaration cited in the resolution the appendix also contained a description of the general measures taken by the government those consisted in the publication and the dissemination of the court s judgment and of a manual describing the court s case-law in the area of freedom of association and in the organising of several training sessions for judges and prosecutors on that topic the relevant provisions of the constitution read as follows article the is a state governed by the rule of law it shall be governed in accordance with the constitution and the laws of the

court such registration was made after noncontentious proceedings instituted on the application of the representatives of the legal person concerned articles and in the course of such proceedings the court could gather evidence of its own motion and take into account facts not mentioned by the applicant articles and on march the code was superseded by the code of civil procedure the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission made the following recommendations in its guidelines and explanatory report on legislation on political parties some specific issues cdl-ad april b registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party for a party s participation in general elections or for public financing of a party does not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under articles and of the european convention on human rights any requirements in relation to registration however must be such as are ‘ necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the measures in question countries applying registration procedures to political parties should refrain from imposing excessive requirements for territorial representation of political parties as well as for minimum membership registration of political parties many countries view registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party for participation in general elections or for public financing this practice as the venice commission has stated before in its guidelines on prohibition and dissolution of political parties even if it were regarded as a restriction of the right to freedom of association and freedom of expression would not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under articles and of the european convention on human rights the requirements for registration however differ from one country to another registration may be considered as a measure to inform the authorities about the establishment of the party as well as about its intention to participate in elections and as a consequence benefit from advantages given to political parties as a specific type of association farreaching requirements however can raise the threshold for registration to an unreasonable level which may be inconsistent with the convention any provisions in relation to registration must be such as are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved by the measures in question. a report adopted by the venice commission on february on the establishment organisation and activities of political parties on the basis of the replies to a questionnaire cdl-ad reads in so far as relevant some countries impose on political parties an obligation to go through a registration process almost all countries mentioned in the first group in paragraph have to go through a registration process or at least through deposition of their articles of association with the competent authorities of their country this process is justified by the need of formal recognition of an association as a political party some of these additional requirements can differ from one country to another a convocation of the assembly on the establishment of the party albania armenia azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina and b establishing articles of association/charter albania armenia austria azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina croatia cyprus czech republic estonia lithuania and c drafting of a programme albania armenia azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina canada croatia czech republic estonia germany latvia lithuania romania and slovakia d minimum membership azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina canada croatia czech republic estonia georgia germany greece kyrgyzstan latvia lithuania russian federation slovakia and turkey e election of the board/presidency/permanent committee albania armenia croatia cyprus romania and f permanent address of its offices/leaders armenia azerbaijan canada croatia cyprus romania russian federation and g principles of internal organisation czech republic germany lithuania poland romania russian federation spain and h payment of the registration fee armenia and i signatures attesting certain territorial representation moldova russian federation turkey and and j publication of information on the establishment of the party in mass media after these requirements are met a competent body ministry of justice for example proceeds with official registration in the case of such countries as for example austria and the charter articles of association are just submitted to the competent authority in order to be added to a special state register most countries consider registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political formation however some countries as it has been already mentioned consider that state registration is a pure formality for example in the ministry of the interior can not refuse the deposition or a registration of the charter of a party there is another criteria of distinction as to the status given to a party in some countries registration of such associations is required in order to give a full legal personality to such association if such registration is not carried out a party can not have bank accounts receive founding from public funds or hold property azerbaijan croatia georgia and certain states have a stricter rule as to the registration process for example in current legislation on political parties imposes a duty on political parties to provide the ministry of justice with its membership lists every year for having its registration reeffected. the explanatory report to protocol no cets no reads in so far as relevant rapid and full execution of the court s judgments is vital it is even more important in cases concerning structural problems so as to ensure that the court is not swamped with repetitive applications for this reason ever since the ministerial conference of and november resolution i it has been considered essential to strengthen the means given in this context to the committee of ministers the parties to the convention have a collective duty to preserve the court s authority and thus the convention system s credibility and effectiveness whenever the committee of ministers considers that one of the high contracting parties refuses expressly or through its conduct to comply with the court s final judgment in a case to which it is party paragraphs and of article accordingly empower the committee of ministers to bring infringement proceedings in the court which shall sit as a grand chamber see new article paragraph b having first served the state concerned with notice to comply the committee of ministers decision to do so requires a qualified majority of two thirds of the representatives entitled to sit on the committee this infringement procedure does not aim to reopen the question of violation already decided in the court s first judgment nor does it provide for payment of a financial penalty by a high contracting party found in violation of article paragraph it is felt that the political pressure exerted by proceedings for noncompliance in the grand chamber and by the latter s judgment should suffice to secure execution of the court s initial judgment by the state concerned the committee of ministers should bring infringement proceedings only in exceptional circumstances none the less it appeared necessary to give the committee of ministers as the competent organ for supervising execution of the court s judgments a wider range of means of pressure to secure execution of judgments currently the ultimate measure available to the committee of ministers is recourse to article of the council of europe s statute suspension of voting rights in the committee of ministers or even expulsion from the organisation this is an extreme measure which would prove counterproductive in most cases indeed the high contracting party which finds itself in the situation foreseen in paragraph of article continues to need far more than others the discipline of the council of europe the new article therefore adds further possibilities of bringing pressure to bear to the existing ones the procedure s mere existence and the threat of using it should act as an effective new incentive to execute the court s judgments it is foreseen that the outcome of infringement proceedings would be expressed in a judgment of the court,case originated two

were planned to be held in baku it appears that the organisers of the demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority the baku city executive authority the bcea information about the demonstrations was disseminated through facebook or the press according to the applicants the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner the demonstrations of january and march were aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army the demonstration of january condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations while those taking part in the demonstration of december were protesting against bureaucratic injustices which had allegedly caused a disabled war veteran to set himself on fire on december each applicant attended one of the demonstrations see appendix but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered all the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations the applicants were questioned at the police stations they were taken to on the day of each applicant s arrest administrative offence reports inzibati xəta haqqında protokol were issued which stated that the applicants had committed an administrative offence under article of the code of administrative offences the cao participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law some of the applicants refused to sign the administrative offence reports applications nos and according to most of the applicants they were never served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from their case files they were not given access to a lawyer after their arrest or while they were in police custody according to statements ərizə written by the applicants in applications nos and at the police stations on the day of their arrest january and march respectively they refused the services of a lawyer the applicants in applications nos and were released after being kept in police custody for a few hours subject to an undertaking to reappear at the police station on various dates most of the applicants were taken to trial courts directly from the police stations either on the day of their arrest or the following day the applicants in applications nos and were brought before first-instance courts on the day they returned to the police station according to most of the applicants the court hearing in each case was very brief members of the public were not allowed in the courtroom even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public according to most of the applicants they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing state-funded lawyers were asked to assist some of them the applicants in applications nos and were not represented by a lawyer according to documents from the case files the applicants in applications nos and refused the assistance of a state-funded lawyer and decided to defend themselves in person according to the transcript of the hearing concerning the applicant in application no the state-funded lawyer stated briefly in his oral submissions that the applicant was guilty and asked the court for lenience similarly the state-funded lawyer for the applicant in application no stated in general terms that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to discontinue the case in addition none of the material submitted to the court contains any record of showing that the state-funded lawyer mr v.m. made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicant in application no the only witnesses questioned during the court hearings with respect to the applicants in applications nos and were the police officers who according to the official records had arrested them the police officers testified that the applicants had staged unauthorised demonstrations no witnesses were questioned by the courts in the other applicants cases the first-instance courts found that the applicants had participated in unauthorised demonstrations the applicants were convicted under article of the cao and sentenced to a period of administrative detention varying from thirteen to seventeen days or to a fine of or azerbaijani manats azn see appendix on various dates the applicants lodged appeals with the baku court of appeal arguing that their convictions had been in violation of their rights because the demonstrations in which they had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful the applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the first-instance courts had not been fair they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the first-instance courts decisions in their cases the applicants in applications nos and were assisted before the baku court of appeal by lawyers of their own choosing the other applicants were not represented by a lawyer on various dates the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance courts see appendix in its decision with regard to the applicant in application no the court of appeal noted inter alia that he had voluntarily refused legal assistance at the pre-trial stage at the time of the applicants arrest article iv of the law on freedom of assembly of november provided that no prior written notification was required for spontaneous assemblies before amendments introduced by law no of november a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was punishable under article of the code of administrative offences of the cao by a reprimand or a fine of seven to thirteen manats azn law no of november which entered into force on january introduced new wording to article of the cao on breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies according to that amendment participation in an assembly organised in breach of such rules became explicitly punishable under article of the cao and punishments in the form of administrative detention of up to days or community service were introduced for the first time in addition the fine for a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was increased and the amounts fixed as follows between azn and for participants of an assembly azn to azn for individuals who organise an assembly azn to azn for persons in charge vəzifəli şəxslər who organise an assembly and between azn and azn for legal entities involved in the organisation of an assembly a further increase in the penalties for breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies occured in may by law no of may which entered into force on june the administrative detention sentence foreseen in article and article of the cao was increased to up to two months according to presidential order sərəncam no of december which was in force until september the minimum wage in azerbaijan was azn the relevant extracts of resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe the honouring of obligations and commitments by azerbaijan read as follows regrettably there is no political dialogue with the opposition parties outside parliament the assembly is concerned by the restrictive climate for the activities of the extra-parliamentary opposition which complains about limitations imposed on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the lack of access to the public media the establishment of an inclusive political system and a truly competitive and unrestrictive political environment requires full implementation of basic freedoms including freedom of expression freedom of assembly and freedom of association the situation in azerbaijan is preoccupying and the assembly expresses its deep concern in this regard recently adopted amendments to the criminal code and the administrative code which have increased penalties for the organisers of and participants in unauthorised gatherings raise concern considering the authorities ongoing blanket ban on protests in the baku city centre these amendments are likely to have a further negative impact on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression the restrictive use of certain articles of the criminal code in particular articles and against participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised demonstrations is another matter of concern the relevant extracts of report commdh of august by nils muižnieks the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe following his visit to azerbaijan from to may read as follows the commissioner is deeply concerned by the recent amendments to the law on freedom of assembly the criminal code and the code of administrative offences which further erode the right to freedom of assembly the sanctions which can now be imposed coupled with the fact that local authorities have not authorised a single rally in baku city centre in recent years clearly have a chilling effect on the organisation of or participation in demonstrations the commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question provided they do not do anything illegal violent or obscene in the course of it the commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly is imposed for a summary of other relevant provisions concerning administrative proceedings the relevant provisions concerning the organisation and holding of public assemblies and the relevant extracts of international documents see the judgment in the case of gafgaz mammadov v. azerbaijan no october,case originated eight applications nos republic azerbaijan lodged court

conclude the meeting before p.m. at the meeting which started as planned the already-dissolved grand academic council elected the second applicant as the new rector of the university thereafter a group of about twenty people including all of the applicants headed to the office of the acting rector in order to inform the latter of the council s decision and to demand his resignation according to the applicants they entered the acting rector s office without using any force and informed him of the grand council s decision they asked g.kh to leave the office the latter however refused to do so while the meeting at the rector s office continued the police entered the university grounds the police officers went straight to the office of the acting rector who upon their entrance immediately left the room afterwards the police asked the applicants along with the other people present to leave they left the rector s office without any resistance and moved to a lecture hall the government disputed the applicants version of events according to the official version of events at least twenty people forced their way into g.kh. s office while dozens of others stayed in the reception area and the corridor chanting slogans against g.kh the second applicant informed the acting rector of the former grand academic council s decision and demanded that he leave his office within ten minutes the university security service was no longer in control of the situation and the functioning of the university administration was disrupted given that the applicants and other protesters were refusing to leave the police were called to restore order g.kh left his office as soon as the police arrived then it took more than one hour for the police to negotiate the applicants removal from the rector s office according to the case file after their removal from the rector s office the applicants together with other protesters in total some people gathered in one of the lecture halls of the main university building where they continued their protest the applicants alleged that at around p.m. the police had closed the doors of the lecture hall and prevented the people inside from leaving it they had been locked in the lecture hall without access to water food or toilet facilities until approximately a.m. the next day on july criminal proceedings were initiated under article of the criminal code of georgia against unidentified perpetrators in respect of the organisation and participation in group actions violating public order according to the applicants on july the minister of education held a press briefing denouncing the events that had taken place at the university on the preceding day he referred to those involved in the july events as hooligans and gave an assurance that they would all bear responsibility for their actions over the following several days twenty witnesses were questioned in connection with the events of july among them six police patrol officers three members of the university security service and eleven administrative staff members including the acting rector g.kh. and his deputy the staff members eyewitnesses to the events all identified the applicants as being among those who had forced their way into the rector s office insulted him and demanded his resignation they noted that while there had been no physical confrontation the group of so-called protesting professors had been acting in a highly disrespectful manner chanting insulting expressions against mr g.kh they also claimed that the university had remained paralysed during the incident with several meetings being disrupted and the rector and several members of the university administration being prevented from carrying out their duties the acting rector testified that around twenty people among them all the applicants in disregard of the orders of the security staff had burst into his office the second applicant had informed him of the former grand academic council s decision and had categorically კატეგორიულად demanded that he leave his office bag and baggage ბარგი-ბარხანა within ten minutes g.kh explained that their meeting had continued against a background of noise and chanting with the protestors chanting leave leave he had not been personally insulted although his colleagues had told him that protesters in the corridor adjacent to his office had been chanting insulting slogans in reply to a direct question he explained that no foul language had been used by protesters in his office either in respect of him or of his colleagues he remembered however mr dolidze inciting via cell phone other protesters to join them in the acting rector s office lastly g.kh noted that the incident in his office had lasted for about an hour and a half paralysing not only his work but the functioning of the whole administration of the university the security service members who were also questioned during the pre-trial investigation claimed that they had been unable to identify the professors involved in the events by name they confirmed however that a large group of about fifty people in disobedience of the orders given by the security service had entered the reception area of the office of the rector by force then around fifteen or twenty people had forced their way into the rector s office where they had stayed for about two hours and until the police secured their removal from the office on july the second fourth fifth seventh and eighth applicants were also questioned as witnesses in the course of the abovementioned criminal proceedings on july several members of the former grand academic council among them the second third fourth fifth and seventh applicants sent a letter to the president of georgia complaining about the events of june and july with reference to the events of july they made a particular complaint that they along with several hundred other people had been locked in the university lecture hall for the whole night they alleged that this had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment as they had been denied access to drinking water and a toilet and had been left without fresh air they requested the initiation of criminal proceedings in this regard a copy of the above-mentioned letter was sent to the prosecutor general of georgia in support of their request the applicants submitted statements given by fifteen people accounting in detail for the events of june and july on july the relevant prosecutor issued a ruling terminating the criminal proceedings concerning the alleged organisation and participation in group actions violating public order the prosecutor concluded that the actions of the applicants had not comprised elements of a crime the ruling read further as follows they committed offences namely arbitrary behaviour a minor violation of public order and disobeying the lawful instructions of law-enforcement personnel which constitute administrative offences under articles and of the code of administrative offences. in the operative part of the prosecutor s ruling the prosecutor stated that the ruling along with the case file was to be sent to the tbilisi city court in order for administrative proceedings to be conducted against the applicants in the same ruling the prosecutor also decided on the termination of the proceedings that apparently had been opened against the police officers in respect of their alleged unlawful use of force on july finding the complaint lodged by the applicants in that connection unsubstantiated the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings provided in its operative part a fifteen-day time-limit for an appeal the prosecutor s ruling did not mention the applicants complaint concerning the events of june the applicants were served with a copy of the above-mentioned ruling late in the evening of july they were told at the same time that a hearing in the administrative proceedings initiated against them had been scheduled for the next day on july a hearing took place at the tbilisi city court the applicants objected that owing to the initiation of the administrative proceedings they could not avail themselves of the opportunity to challenge the prosecutorial ruling of july they furthermore complained that they had not had sufficient time to acquaint themselves with the relevant material in the case file and to hire a lawyer the applicants also requested that the acting rector of the university and the security staff of the university be questioned the prosecutor for his part requested the questioning of three of the police officers involved in the events that had developed in the rector s office on july the judge allowed a request lodged by the prosecutor for the three police officers to be examined in court and postponed the hearing until august at the hearing on august the applicants reiterated their request for the acting rector to be examined in court they furthermore requested that the court hear the deputy rector of the university and four other eyewitnesses to the events of july including two journalists who had not been questioned at the pre-trial stage of the discontinued criminal proceedings the judge granted the applicants leave to question the four new witnesses while refusing their request for the questioning of the acting rector and his deputy in that connection the court reasoned that those two individuals had already been questioned at the pre-trial stage and observed that their statements had been included in the case file according to the minutes of the august hearing the applicants challenged the factual circumstances of the events of july as presented by the prosecutor they maintained that they had not broken into the rector s office but rather that they had entered the office and had sat there calmly without using any force that they had not insulted or threatened the acting rector but had simply presented him with the decision of the grand academic council and that they had not disobeyed the instructions of the police but had left the rector s office within ten or fifteen minutes of being ordered to do so by the police the second applicant stated that he had been taken out of the office sitting on a chair because he had apparently looked very tired the applicants lawyers also argued that the rector s office did not constitute a public space for the purposes of article of the code of administrative offences cao see paragraph below and that in any event the applicants had simply been exercising their right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression as provided for in the constitution of georgia lastly they alleged that the prosecutor had presented the case in a manner suggesting the collective administrative liability of the applicants as the individual role of each applicant in the events of july had not been identified the applicants also reiterated their complaint that they had been locked in the university lecture hall for the night of july without their having access to water or toilets they tried to put to the prosecutor several questions in this regard but the presiding judge dismissed the questions as irrelevant having no bearing on the case during the hearing of august the following witnesses were questioned v.j. a member of the university security service claimed that about fifty people disregarding his orders and pushing him away had forced their way to the reception area of the rector s office in reply to the judge s question he said that he could not recall exactly who had pushed him he furthermore stated that various protesters had been making insulting statements and noise and that as a result the work in the main building of the university had been disrupted according to the statement given in court by g.ch. a police patrol officer at the moment of his arrival at the university there had been around people protesting outside he had entered the building and had tried to enter the rector s office which had been blocked by protestors after making his way through protesters and entering the office of g.kh he had seen around twenty people inside it had taken him and the other officers about one hour to persuade the protesters to leave the office in reply to a question he clarified that no one had physically resisted the police but that the protesters had simply refused to leave the office he also specified that insulting statements had been made by protestors in the corridor and not in the acting rector s office z.s. another police officer confirmed that while no force had been used they had spent an hour persuading a group of about twenty people to leave the rector s office he said that mr mebonia the second applicant had been taken out of the office still sitting on a chair as he had refused to stand up and leave by himself he added that he recalled all of the applicants except for ms sikharulidze the sixth applicant being inside the rector s office the third police officer k.b. who was also questioned in court similarly maintained that there had been no physical confrontation inside the office but that it had taken a while before those inside had agreed to leave on the same date the court examined two members of the university staff who gave evidence similar to their pre-trial statements see paragraph above in addition the court questioned two journalists and two professors all of whom had been among the group of protesters on july all four claimed that there had been no confrontation either physical or verbal in the office of the rector that the group had been simply demanding the resignation of g.kh. and that they had left the office at the request of the police by a decision of august the tbilisi city court found the first second third fourth fifth seventh and eight applicants guilty of the abovementioned administrative offences under articles and of the cao and imposed a fine of georgian laris gel approximately euros on each of them the court terminated the proceedings concerning the alleged disobeying of a lawful order given by the police article with respect to the sixth and ninth applicants finding that they had left the office of the rector before the arrival of the police and held them guilty of the administrative offences under articles and of the cao only imposing a fine of gel on each of them see paragraph below in reaching its decision the tbilisi city court concluded that the grand academic council had begun acting unlawfully starting from june when the old university charter had been repealed by presidential decree no consequently the court found that the restoration of the dissolved body the impugned election of the new university rector on july and the subsequent demand for the resignation of g.kh in view of the election had been unlawful and constituted the administrative offence arbitrary behaviour within the meaning of article of the cao see paragraph below in connection with the charge of a minor breach of public order minor hooliganism the court established that the applicants had burst into the office of g.kh. calling for his resignation they had demanded in an insulting manner that he immediately leave his office and take all his belongings with him the court concluded that given that the applicants had occupied the office of the acting rector against his will for about two hours and had disregarded his repeated requests for them to leave it in order to allow everyone to resume their work their behaviour had amounted to insulting harassment შეურაცხმყოფელი გადაკიდება with respect to g.kh as well as the other staff present and to other similar action that had violated public order and peace the tbilisi city court dismissed the applicants argument that the rector s office was merely a private working space reasoning that the presence of the public rendered it a public space for the purposes of the cao as to the submission by the defence that the applicants had simply been exercising their right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression as provided in the constitution of georgia the court concluded as follows the court notes that although a person is entitled to exercise the rights and freedoms enshrined in articles and of the constitution he or she is at the same time obliged in the process of exercising his or her rights to abstain from violating others rights and interests from encroaching upon others honour and dignity and from violating public order he or she should not in exercising his or her constitutional rights commit acts prohibited by law which in the court s view in fact happened on july in the office of the rector as for the charge of disobeying a lawful order given by the police the court concluded that the sixth and ninth applicants had left the office of g.kh before the arrival of the police they were thus acquitted of the above-mentioned charge as for the remainder of the applicants the court established that despite the repeated requests of the police they had refused to leave the office of the acting rector in the court s view notwithstanding the fact that no physical force had been used the applicants refusal for more than an hour to obey the orders of the police had amounted to a breach of article of the cao see paragraph below the applicants appealed against the first-instance court s decision to the chairwoman of the tbilisi court of appeal they complained that there had been no record of an administrative offence having been made individually in respect of each of them that their individual roles in the commission of the impugned administrative offences had not been established and that the proceedings had been brought in a manner suggesting their collective liability in that connection they referred to the statements of witnesses who had noted that there had been two hundred people outside and twenty people inside the acting rector s office during the events of july and that it was impossible to identify the individuals who had allegedly insulted the acting rector and forced their way into his office the applicants also complained of the failure of the tbilisi city court to examine the acting rector and his deputy in the course of the trial lastly they challenged the categorisation of their actions as administrative offences by the first-instance court submitting that they had simply been exercising their freedom of expression and freedom of assembly on september the chairwoman of the tbilisi court of appeal sitting privately in her office and without holding an oral hearing dismissed the applicants appeal as unsubstantiated she concluded that the decision of the first-instance court had been lawful and properly reasoned the operative part of the decision of september indicated that no further appeal was possible the case file contains a copy of a television report by the imedi broadcasting company about the events of july as was shown in imedi s recording of the events of july at least twenty people had entered the reception area of the acting rector s office by force in disregard of the protests of the security staff and reception staff then some of them had walked into the office itself notifying g.kh of the decision of the grand academic council and demanding his resignation according to the video dozens of protesters had simultaneously gathered in the corridor adjacent to the acting rector s office and had chanted step down imedi also ran an extract from the

application the government did not object to the examination of the application by the committee the applicants were born in and respectively they live in st petersburg the first and the second applicants are spouses on april in st petersburg a coalition of opposition groups organised an anti-government rally to campaign before the forthcoming parliamentary elections as a part of a series of protest demonstrations called a march of dissenters the city administration authorised the rally in the form of a meeting to be held between noon and p.m. at pionerskaya square the site of the rally was cordoned off by metal railings and several rows of police officers the government submitted that police officers were deployed including officers from the special purpose squad омон hereinafter the riot police the applicants attended the rally according to them when the rally ended the police directed all the protesters to the nearby pushkinskaya metro station having closed all neighbouring quarters to traffic and pedestrians the applicants saw the riot police running towards them and indiscriminately hitting all those around them the metro station was closed they tried to escape via zagorodnyy prospect but were blocked in between the police cordons the police pushed the civilians into a small park some persons entered it via the gate while others had to climb over the fence as submitted by the government at the end of the rally a group of approximately persons under the flags of the national bolshevik party attempted to break through the police cordon and to lead an unauthorised march via zagorodnyy prospect towards moskovskiy prospect according to the government persons in that group shouted slogans and threw bottles and other objects at the police officers according to the government s version of events the riot police had to use force in order to disperse that particular group of protesters and restore public order during these events the first applicant was approached and severely beaten by a riot police officer the officer hit him on the chest ribs and shoulders and left him lying unconscious other protesters and the second applicant carried the first applicant to the ambulance van he was later taken to the mariinskiy hospital at the hospital the first applicant was diagnosed with a closed fracture of the seventh rib traumatic pneumothorax a closed craniocerebral injury brain concussion during the same period the third applicant was hit by a riot police officer with a rubber truncheon to the face she started falling unconscious but she was helped by other protesters the third applicant was subsequently diagnosed with a craniocerebral injury sustained on april concussion closed fractures of the nose bones and the right cheek bone the first and the third applicants remained in the hospital for several days before being released for outpatient treatment on april the emergency doctors and the hospital informed the prosecution authorities that the first and the third applicants had applied for medical assistance in april the applicants submitted their complaints to the st petersburg prosecution authorities about the police brutality they submitted additional complaints in may on june a criminal case was opened on august the third applicant was granted the status of a victim in the criminal case on october the third applicant submitted inter alia that the police officer who had attacked her wore a helmet and had no identification markings on june and november the domestic courts found that the prosecution authorities had failed to comply with the time-limits established for examination of individual complaints had unlawfully denied the applicants access to the case-file of the enquiry and had failed to ensure their procedural rights during the criminal investigation on november the first and the second applicants were granted the status of victims in the criminal case on december the first applicant gave to the investigator the photographs from newspapers depicting the officer who looked like the police officer who had attacked him the officer had a number indicated on his helmet it was later established that the photo was made in another city one day before the rally the investigator attempted to identify the officer by the available number he got a reply from the police that the helmet with that number had not been used on the day of the events between december and june the criminal investigation was suspended seven times due to failure to identify the police officers who had attacked the applicants on june the criminal proceedings were stayed as the perpetrators could not be identified the first applicant challenged the decision to stay the proceedings arguing that the investigator had not taken all the necessary steps to identify the police officers involved in the attacks on april the oktyabrskiy district court of st petersburg found the decision of june lawful the court noted that during the investigation it was established that on april some unidentified police officers had exceeded their official powers and beaten a number of protesters the court further noted that the victims and witnesses could not identify the police officers due to the fact that the officers were wearing helmets and had no identification markings the photographs provided by one of the witnesses did not reveal any relevant information for the investigation the court acknowledged that in the first applicant s case there had been an attempt to identify the police officer concerned by the number on his helmet seen on the photos provided by the applicant himself the court finally observed that during the criminal investigation some police officers deployed during the rally had been questioned and video and photo materials had been analysed however none of the above measures allowed to identify the perpetrators the court therefore rejected the applicant s complaint on june the st petersburg city court upheld the decision of april it appears that the criminal proceedings are still pending for a summary of the relevant domestic law provisions governing use of

the case originated in two applications nos and against the republic of moldova lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by hyde park at that point a non-governmental organisation and four moldovan nationals mr ghenadie brega mr. anatolie juraveli mr oleg brega and mr anatol hristea-stan the applicants on february they were born in and respectively they live in pepeni chişinău pepeni and chişinău respectively and are all members of hyde park on june the non-governmental organisation hyde park ceased to exist its successor the hyde park unincorporated association expressed its intention to pursue the application before the court the applicants were represented by mr oleg brega hyde park 's leader at the time of the events the moldovan government the government were represented by their agent mr vladimir grosu the applicants alleged in particular a breach of their right to freedom of assembly and to a fair trial in respect of three demonstrations held on august september and september on april the president of the fourth section decided to give notice of the applications to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility article at the time of the events in question hyde park was registered with the moldovan ministry of justice as a non-governmental organisation lobbying inter alia for freedom of expression and the right to free assembly in its members decided to discontinue registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation from the state in particular they complained of the refusal of the ministry of justice to register amendments to the organisation 's articles of association the repeated freezing of its bank account arbitrary arrest of its members attempts to shut down its newspaper and other such interferences several of the organisation 's leaders requested political asylum in western countries and it was decided to continue the activity under the same name but without being registered with the state authorities it was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation 's successor after the striking of the organisation out of the government 's list of non-governmental organisations on june hyde park 's activity continued on the basis of new articles of association and all the activities were carried on the association continued editing its newspaper and its internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations on july hyde park applied to the municipal council of chişinău for authorisation to stage a protest on august in front of the ministry of internal affairs and the prosecutor general 's office against alleged acts of harassment of hyde park by those bodies on august the municipal council authorised the protest to be staged on august in front of the building of the ministry of internal affairs between a.m. and a.m. and in front of the prosecutor general 's office between a.m. and a.m. at a distance of at least fifty metres from the buildings on august at a.m. the applicants started their protest in front of the ministry of internal affairs but were immediately approached by a police officer who ordered them to stop the protest because the municipality 's authorisation had been challenged by the prosecutor general 's office in court on august the police officer argued that according to the law on the prosecutor 's office the prosecutor 's appeal against an administrative act suspended the latter 's action until after a court examined it the applicants refused to comply and argued that the authorisation was valid and that their protest was peaceful they relied on the provisions of the constitution of moldova and on the convention shortly thereafter a police van arrived and mr ghenadie brega mr oleg brega mr hristea-stan and mr juraveli were arrested and taken to a police station where they were questioned at approximately a.m. they were released without explanation they could not continue their protest because the time indicated in the authorisation had lapsed the same day a criminal complaint was lodged against the police officers who carried out the arrests however the complaint was dismissed by the head of the police station of the centru district on september on the ground that the authorisation contained numerous flaws such as a failure to indicate the exact place of the protest and the number of participants it appears that the prosecutor office 's appeal against the municipality 's authorisation of august has never been examined by the courts on august mr juraveli the vice-president of hyde park applied to the municipality for an authorisation to stage a protest in front of the ministry of internal affairs and the prosecutor 's office between and september against the allegedly abusive suppression of its peaceful protest of the same date in the application he indicated that ten persons were to participate in the demonstration and gave his name and those of mr oleg brega and mr hristea-stan as those responsible for the conduct of the demonstration the municipality did not adopt a decision in respect of the application before the first date of the planned demonstration on september therefore at a.m. that day the applicants started their protest in front of the ministry of internal affairs at a.m. ghenadie brega oleg brega and a hyde park member who is not an applicant were arrested on the ground that the demonstration had not been authorised they were taken to a police station where they were body searched and kept for approximately five hours according to the applicants the police examined and made copies of their documents including personal letters two of them were placed in cages and later in cells later they were taken to the centru district court and since the hearing was adjourned they

cases where chanting slogans constitutes propaganda for that organisation it is not possible to state that those crimes were committed on behalf of the organisation in order for a court to conclude that a crime was committed on behalf of an organisation the latter must have called for action not to an undefined collective but rather to an individual person who is capable of directly committing

and to look out for the brave insurgents of the kurdish people for this reason on of march in a way that befits our week of heroism we are calling our people to down their shutters not to work and to collectively attend the funeral in an effort to embrace our six martyrs on march brochures containing the same statements were handed out to the public in various locations in diyarbakır along with these web sites which are the media organs of the organisation the pkk roj tv which is the ‘ voice of the organisation created tension within society with its frequent broadcasts calling the people to stop going to work to close down their businesses and not to send their children to school people who attended the funerals of the deceased pkk members carried out the said actions similarly the protests spread to many other cities and districts notably batman siirt istanbul and mersin throughout the nationwide protests above two hundred police officers were injured several cars were burned the windows of an indeterminate number of shops were smashed and many state buildings were set on fire people died during the events whereas persons were injured archive records of people who were apprehended in relation to the incidents in diyarbakir reveal that a number of them had previously been investigated on charges of membership of the pkk aiding the pkk and disseminating propaganda in support of that organisation some of them had been previously convicted on charges such as usurpation and robbery and they tried to take advantage of the chaotic atmosphere which lasted for to days out of people who had participated in the protests and who were taken into custody were younger than years old ö. who had participated in the protests which occurred upon the pkk s appeals and instructions was apprehended on may it has been established beyond any doubt in the light of the incident reports reports containing a description of the events on the basis of police video recordings video footage and photographs that the accused were involved in the following incidents apart from the events of april participation in the funeral of e.e. a member of the pkk who had been killed on february the accused carried the deceased terrorist s coffin sang the pkk s so-called anthem ‘ hernepeş chanted slogans praising the pkk and its so-called leader such as ‘ öcalan öcalan öcalan is our political will ‘ kurdistan will be the grave for fascism and ‘ guerrilla strikes to found kurdistan and directed the group participation in the newroz celebrations held in diyarbakır fairground on march the accused was among a group of people who attacked the police officers at the control points at the entrances to the fairground destroyed the barriers and carried the flags symbolising pkk and the posters of its so-called leader the accused directed the group and police officers were injured the dispute to be resolved by the plenary court of cassation criminal divisions is whether the accused s acts participation in illegal demonstrations of february march and march specially held upon the appeals by the pkk in accordance with the latter s general invitation for demonstrations and with its new strategy leading a group of demonstrators carrying symbols of the pkk and posters of abdullah öcalan giving instruction to the demonstrators to attack the police attack on the police being in a group of people who received the remains of members of the organisation killed by the security forces during operations in line with the calls of the pkk and making a victory sign chanting slogans such as ‘ öcalan is our political will ‘ our leader is our political will and ‘ guerrilla strikes to found kurdistan directing a group that lit a fire on a road and blocked the traffic which constitute independent offences can also be considered offences committed on behalf of the organisation article of the criminal code law no which entered into force on june reads as follows ‘ other provisions relating to the offence of establishing organisations for the purpose of criminal activity are also applicable for this offence. article of the criminal code reads as follows ‘ anyone who commits a crime on behalf of the illegal organisation even if they are not a member of that organisation shall also be punished for being a member of the organisation. the aforementioned provision reflects an approach that is utterly different from the approach of the former criminal code law no according to this provision the offences committed in line with an illegal organisation s activities impose further criminal responsibility acts of aiding are also considered as membership of an organisation a separate offence of aiding an illegal organisation was not envisaged aiding an organisation by way of providing weapons was proscribed in a separate provision i.e article having regard to the gravity of that offence other acts of aiding were proscribed in articles and of the same code in the circumstances of the present case the illegal organisation s public call has been made concrete through broadcasts from media organs of the organisation and there is no need for such calls to target identified individual persons it is established that the acts carried out on behalf of the organisation were within the knowledge of the organisation and in line with its will the acts of an accused who participates in these acts carried out on behalf of the organisation constitute a breach of article of the criminal code on the basis of articles and of the criminal code along with the breaches of criminal law provisions thus the judgment of the first-instance court must be quashed the convention on the rights of the child adopted by the general assembly of the united nations on november has binding force under international law vis-à-vis the contracting states including all of the member states of the council of europe article of the convention states for the purposes of the present convention a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child majority is attained earlier. article reads in all actions concerning children whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions courts of law administrative authorities or legislative bodies the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. article reads in so far as relevant as follows states parties shall ensure that b no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily the arrest detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time c every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age the relevant part of article provides states parties recognize the right of every child alleged as accused of or recognized as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child s sense of dignity and worth which reinforces the child s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child s age and the desirability of promoting the child s reintegration and the child s assuming a constructive role in society states parties shall seek to promote the establishment of laws procedures authorities and institutions specifically applicable to children alleged as accused of or recognized as having infringed the penal law and in particular b whenever appropriate and desirable measures for dealing with such children without resorting to judicial proceedings providing that human rights and legal safeguards are fully respected a variety of dispositions such as care guidance and supervision orders counselling probation foster care education and vocational training programmes and other alternatives to institutional care shall be available to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence. the relevant part of the general comment no of the committee on the rights of the child dated april reads children in conflict with the law including child recidivists have the right to be treated in ways that promote their reintegration and the child s assuming a constructive role in society art of crc the arrest detention or imprisonment of a child may be used only as a measure of last resort art b it is therefore necessary as part of a comprehensive policy for juvenile justice to develop and implement a wide range of measures to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate to both their circumstances and the offence committed these should include care guidance and supervision counselling probation foster care educational and training programmes and other alternatives to institutional care art when judicial proceedings are initiated by the competent authority usually the prosecutor s office the principles of a fair and just trial must be applied at the same time the juvenile justice system should provide for ample opportunities to deal with children in conflict with the law by using social and/or educational measures and to strictly limit the use of deprivation of liberty and in particular pre-trial detention as a measure of last resort in the disposition phase of the proceedings deprivation of liberty must be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time art b this means that states parties should have in place a the committee wishes to emphasize that the reaction to an offence should always be in proportion not only to the circumstances and the gravity of the offence but also to the age lesser culpability circumstances and needs of the child as well as to the various and particularly long-term needs of the society a strictly punitive approach is not in accordance with the leading principles for juvenile justice spelled out in article of crc the relevant part of the concluding observations of the united nations committee on the rights of the child turkey dated july states as follows freedom of association and peaceful assembly the committee recommends that the state party continue its efforts to ensure full enjoyment of the freedoms of expression association and peaceful assembly by children by amending its legislation to remove the remaining obstacles to these rights including the minimum age for forming an organisational committee for outdoor meetings the committee further recommends that the state party take all measures to remove other obstacles in the procedures and facilitate the process to ensure that children are able to exercise their rights in accordance with the law administration of juvenile justice the committee commends the state party for its extensive reforms in the area of juvenile justice including new legislative changes resulting in the increase of the age of criminal liability from to years requiring all persons under the age of including those charged under the counter-terrorism law to be considered in juvenile courts introducing reduced sentences for children and special measures for children who are pushed into crime as well as establishing child prisons child prosecutors and child police however the committee is concerned at the following a insufficient number of professionals working in the juvenile justice system b poor quality of legal assistance provided to children under the free legal aid programme due to the low compensation for lawyers c long duration of trials involving children resulting in large numbers of children in pre-trial detention compared to children serving sentences d unduly heavy penalties against children and lack of alternative measures e reports that amendments to the counter-terrorism law are not upheld in practice as children detained during demonstrations are initially held together with adults f long detention periods and poor conditions in some prisons the committee recommends that the state party bring the juvenile justice system fully in line with the convention on the rights of the child in particular articles and and with other relevant standards including the standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice the beijing rules the guidelines for the prevention of juvenile delinquency the riyadh guidelines the rules for the protection of juveniles deprived of their liberty the havana rules the vienna guidelines for action on children in the criminal justice system and the committee s general comment no on the rights of the child in juvenile justice in particular the committee urges the state party to a increase the number of professionals working in the juvenile justice system b take measures to provide incentives for lawyers to work on cases involving children c expedite the investigation and trial process in cases involving children so as to reduce the number of children in pre-trial detention d take immediate measures to ensure that the detention of children is used as a last resort and that alternative measures are applied for children e ensure enforcement of the amendments to the counter-terrorism law and ensure that children detained and charged under this law are provided with all basic legal guarantees in its resolution adopted on june and entitled child-friendly juvenile justice from rhetoric to reality the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe states the following in particular the assembly calls on the member states to establish a specialised juvenile justice system by means of dedicated laws procedures and institutions for children in conflict with the law inter alia the institution of a children s ombudsperson following the positive practice of some member states set the minimum age of criminal responsibility at at years of age while establishing a range of suitable alternatives to formal prosecution for younger offenders prohibit exceptions to the minimum age of criminal responsibility even for serious offences ensure that detention of juveniles is used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period of time in particular by determining an age limit below which it is not permitted to deprive a child of his or her liberty preferably higher than the minimum age of criminal responsibility developing a broad range of alternative non-custodial measures and sanctions to pre-trial detention and post-trial incarceration including educational measures community sanctions and treatment programmes abolishing life imprisonment of any kind for children establishing a reasonable maximum period to which a child may be sentenced providing regular reviews of custodial measures and/or sanctions a child may be subjected to ensure that deprivation of liberty used only as a measure of last resort aims at rehabilitating and reintegrating children into society in particular by providing appropriate training and treatment programmes develop a broad range of diversion programmes respecting human rights standards and based inter alia on principles of restorative justice with a view to dealing with juvenile offenders without resorting to judicial proceedings decriminalise status offences which are acts classified as offences only when committed by children ensure that all actors involved in the administration of juvenile justice receive appropriate training with a view to guaranteeing an effective implementation of children s rights in this context prevent the detention of young offenders by inter alia introducing a system of rapid intervention with the aim of allowing a multi-professional team including the police social workers psychiatric nurses and youth workers to facilitate the investigation of crimes committed by young offenders and to offer them and their families support and rehabilitation the recommendation of the committee of ministers to member states of the council of europe on social reactions to juvenile delinquency r adopted on september at the meeting of the ministers deputies in so far as relevant reads as follows recommends the governments of member states to review if necessary their legislation and practice with a view to excluding the remand in custody of minors apart from exceptional cases of very serious offences committed by older minors in these cases restricting the length of remand in custody and keeping minors apart from adults arranging for decisions of this type to be in principle ordered after consultation with a welfare department on alternative proposals the recommendation on the european rules for juvenile offenders subject to sanctions or measures cm/rec adopted by the committee of ministers on november reads in so far as relevant as follows a basic principles the imposition and implementation of sanctions or measures shall be based on the best interests of the juvenile offenders limited by the gravity of the offences committed principle of proportionality and take account of their age physical and mental well-being development capacities and personal circumstances principle of individualisation as ascertained when necessary by psychological psychiatric or social inquiry reports deprivation of liberty of a juvenile shall be a measure of last resort and imposed and implemented for the shortest period possible special efforts must be undertaken to avoid pre-trial detention in his report published on october following his visit to turkey on june to july commdh mr thomas hammarberg the former commissioner for human rights of the council of europe stated the following during his visit to turkey the commissioner was informed that over the previous nine months approximately children of kurdish origin more than of them between and years of age had been arrested and detained after having taken part in demonstrations organized by kurdish groups and thrown stones at police forces in particular he has been informed that four children aged between and have been detained in the diyarbakır prison since july charged with membership of a terrorist organization as a result of participating in a protest in the above town ngos that met with the commissioner during his visit indicated that prosecution in such cases is often based on article paragraph of the criminal code which provides that any person who commits an offence on behalf of an illegal organisation even though they are not a member of the organization shall be sentenced for the offence as well as for membership of the organization the extensive use of this provision by courts against participants of kurdish-related demonstrations follows a ruling of the general criminal board of the court of cassation in march which indicated that persons participating in demonstrations following public calls by the illegal organization pkk should be brought into the ambit inter alia of the above provision of the criminal code it appears necessary to revisit certain over-restrictive provisions of the legislation concerning elections political parties and broadcasting as well as criminal law provisions such as the criminal code articles and which have been used in a number of occasions in a manner that has unjustifiably suppressed freedom of expression in his report published on july following his visit to turkey on to april commdh mr thomas hammarberg stated the following following his visit the commissioner expressed his deep concern about the application of article of the criminal code and in particular its paragraphs and and considers that this concern remains valid in the context of freedom of expression and freedom of the media in turkey in his report published on january following his visit to turkey on to october commdh mr thomas hammarberg stated the following in his report on turkey the commissioner expressed his concerns about the interpretation and application of the turkish anti-terrorism act act no and certain provisions of the tcc notably article dealing with criminal organisations the commissioner was particularly preoccupied by the wide interpretation of the courts concerning the definition of offences and their constitutive acts under the above provisions pursuant to article tcc a person shall be punished as a member of a criminal organisation even if they are not a member of that organisation or part of its hierarchical structure if they commit an offence on behalf of that organisation paragraph or help it knowingly and willingly paragraph the commissioner had noted in his report that persons participating in demonstrations following public calls by the illegal organization pkk were brought into the ambit of paragraph in accordance with a ruling of the court of cassation in march the commissioner observes that the application of article tcc as well as of articles and of the anti-terrorism act continues to raise serious concerns the commissioner is fully aware of the severe threat posed to turkish society by terrorism and terrorist organisations as well as of the obligation of the turkish state to combat it with effective measures including effective investigations and fair proceedings he wishes to underline however that a major lesson learned in the fight against terrorism in europe has been the importance of public confidence in the justice system this means that any allegation of terrorist activity must be established with convincing evidence and beyond any reasonable doubt experience has shown time and time again that any deviation from established human rights principles in the fight against terrorism including in the functioning of the judiciary ultimately serves the interests of terrorist organisations in this connection it is crucial to bear in mind that violence or the threat to use violence is an essential component of an act of terrorism and that restrictions of human rights in the fight against terrorism ‘ must be defined as precisely as possible and be necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued the commissioner considers that the provisions contained in the turkish anti-terror legislation and article tcc allow for a very wide margin of appreciation in particular in cases where membership in a terrorist organisation has not been proven and when an act or statement may be deemed to coincide with the aims or instructions of a terrorist organisation the commissioner encourages the turkish authorities to reflect on and address these concerns through legislative measures and/or case-law. on february mr thomas hammarberg published his comments concerning a draft law presented to the parliament of turkey by the government which envisaged amendments to various legal provisions including article of the criminal code the draft law in question was subsequently adopted on july law no in his comments the former commissioner for human rights considered as follows the proposed amendments to article tcc article of the bill could be considered in conjunction with the previous amendment these amendments concern paragraphs and of article tcc which provide that a person shall be punished as a member of a criminal organisation even if they are not a member of that organisation or part of its hierarchical structure if they commit an offence on behalf of that organisation paragraph or help it knowingly and willingly paragraph with these amendments the penalty is reduced by half for paragraph and may be reduced by up to two thirds for paragraph this would potentially allow persons being tried for these offences especially where the criminal organisation is considered to fall under the scope of article tcc on armed criminal organisations to benefit from alternative measures to remand in custody while acknowledging that this amendment can have short-term benefits for a number of ongoing trials the commissioner considers that it does not offer a lasting solution to serious problems caused by article as previously highlighted by the commissioner his main concern relating to article is the fact that it allows for a very wide margin of appreciation in particular in cases where membership in a terrorist organisation has not been proven and when an act or statement may be deemed to coincide with the aims or instructions of a terrorist organisation the commissioner considers that this issue calls for a more substantial review of the definition of the offences concerned and encourages the turkish authorities to tackle this question in the context of their future reform package along with other legislative problems identified by the commissioner in his reports on turkey. on november the human rights watch published a report entitled protesting as a terrorist offence the arbitrary use of terrorism laws to prosecute and incarcerate demonstrators in turkey the report mainly concerned trials and convictions of demonstrators in turkey under laws nos and the report in so far as relevant reads as follows in turkey many hundreds of people currently face prosecution or are serving substantial sentences for terrorism convictions their ‘ crime was to engage in peaceful protest or to throw stones or burn a tire at a protest legal amendments since along with case law since have allowed courts in turkey to convict demonstrators under the harshest terrorism laws by invoking two articles of the turkish penal code in combination with the anti-terror law in july as this report was being finalized the government passed legal amendments to improve the treatment of child demonstrators there are fairly frequent localized protests in cities throughout southeast turkey and in mainly kurdish-populated districts of cities such as adana these typically involve groups of youths and children who shout pro-öcalan and pkk slogans burn tires in the street and respond to police orders to disperse by throwing stones in the past courts in turkey convicted these protestors under laws governing public order or of ‘ making propaganda for a terrorist organization article anti-terror law yet in recent years criminal justice officials have deemed kurdish protestors demonstrating against turkey s policies towards the kurds to be ‘ committing crimes on behalf of the pkk without being a member of that organization article turkish penal code as a result they are prosecuted as if they were actually fighting the government as armed ‘ members of the pkk article turkish penal code these serious charges on top of more usual charges under the law on demonstrations and public assemblies could result in sentences of years in prison or more if there are repeated offenses to date the majority of adults convicted under these laws have received prison terms of between seven and years prior to a july legal amendment child protestors typically received prison sentences of between four and five years though in at least several children were sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison law enforcement authorities and the courts allege that the pkk and its representatives are organizing the demonstrations as part of a wider policy to promote civil unrest and even uprising among kurds in towns and cities throughout turkey by way of evidence the government and courts point to the pkk s decrees issued at various congresses and the fact that senior pkk representatives use sympathetic media outlets to issue ‘ appeals to the kurdish population to take to the streets in protest hence the template for individual indictments includes an abstract overview of pkk history and policies followed by a statement of the alleged specific criminal activities of the defendant in none of the cases examined by human rights watch had prosecutors submitted evidence to establish that the individual defendant either heard the pkk s ‘ appeal or had been directly instructed or motivated by the pkk to participate in the demonstration much less that the individual had any other specific link with the pkk or committed a crime under its orders the turkish courts consider it no obstacle to conviction that the prosecution has failed to provide evidence of the defendant s specific intent to support or aid the illegal activities of the pkk the general penal board of the court of cassation has held that it is sufficient to show that sympathetic media outlets broadcast the pkk s ‘ appeals speeches by the pkk leadership calling on the kurdish population to protest or raise their voices on various issues then the defendant by joining the demonstration is assumed to have acted directly under pkk orders yet even at extremely local demonstrations not announced in the media beforehand protestors are routinely charged with acting under the orders of the pkk in some cases courts have held that the pkk s ‘ appeal to participate in demonstrations is a continuous generic one and therefore a specific instance of appeal to the population need not be proved this legal framework makes no distinction between an armed pkk combatant and a civilian demonstrator on july after civil society groups campaigned extensively against the prosecution of children under terrorism laws the turkish parliament adopted several amendments to limit the applicability of such laws to child demonstrators law no published in the official gazette on july states that all children will henceforth stand trial in juvenile courts or adult courts acting as juvenile courts child demonstrators ‘ who commit propaganda crimes or resist dispersal by the police will not be charged with ‘ committing crimes on behalf of a terrorist organization and hence ‘ membership in a terrorist organization and children will not face aggravated penalties and may benefit from sentence postponements and similar measures for public order offenses the amendments also reduce penalties for both children and adults for forcibly resisting police dispersal and offering ‘ armed resistance including with stones during demonstrations under the law on demonstrations and public meetings yet the new law omits any provision to prevent children from being charged with ‘ making propaganda for a terrorist organization either under article of the anti-terror law or article of the turkish penal code the report of amnesty international published on june entitled all children have rights end unfair prosecutions of children under anti-terrorism legislation in turkey concerned the rights of the children who are arrested detained and tried under laws nos and on account of their participation in demonstrations the report reads in so far as relevant while comprehensive statistics regarding the number of children prosecuted under antiterrorism legislation following demonstrations is not available official statistics show that prosecutions were initiated against children under article of the penal code which criminalizes leadership or membership of an armed organization in and against children under the anti-terrorism law during the same period following a parliamentary question tabled by a member of parliament sevahir bayındır in may the justice ministry in a written answer in december stated that from prosecutions were initiated against children under the anti-terrorism law and children under article of the penal code children alleged to have participated in the demonstrations are frequently prosecuted under the anti-terrorism law specifically article which criminalizes making propaganda for a terrorist organization and under article of the penal code via article of the penal code that criminalizes those who commit crimes in the name of a terrorist organization additionally as if they were members of the organization in a lesser number of cases article of the penal code is applied which states ‘ persons knowingly and willingly assisting the organization but not within the hierarchical structure of the organization are punished as members of the organization this application of the law followed a ruling of the supreme court of appeals case number the court considered that the tactics of the pkk were to make use of civil disobedience in this context the court ruled that in demonstrations publicized by media organizations regarded by the turkish state to be associated with the pkk such as roj tv and fırat news agency those that participate in demonstrations could be said to be acting on behalf of a terrorist organization children who have been prosecuted in connection with their participation in the demonstrations have frequently faced multiple charges for the same act including making propaganda for a terrorist organization membership of a terrorist organization and in addition violation of the law on meetings and demonstrations under the convention on the rights of the child which applies to everyone under states are required to establish laws procedures authorities and institutions specifically applicable to children accused of infringing the penal law the un standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice ‘ the beijing rules adopted by the un general assembly in november stipulate in particular that proceedings for children should be conducive to the best interests of the child and shall be conducted in an atmosphere of understanding allowing them to participate and to express themselves freely and that the well-being of the child should be the guiding factor in the consideration of the case amnesty international is concerned that by law children aged are tried in special heavy penal courts under the same procedures as adults for terrorism-related offences article of the anti-terrorism law stipulates that children aged and above are tried in special heavy penal courts for prosecutions brought under anti-terrorism legislation the courts follow the same procedures as for the prosecution of adults save for the fact that the hearings are closed to the public on march amnesty international published a report entitled turkey decriminalize dissent time to deliver on the right to freedom of expression the relevant passages of the report read as follows article committing a crime in the name of a terrorist organization article of the turkish penal code allows the state to punish individuals who have not been proven in court to be members of terrorist organization as though they were if deemed to have performed a criminal act in the name of an organization in full the article reads ‘ a person who commits a crime in the name of an organization without being a member of that organization is punished as a member of the organization the punishment for membership of an organization can be reduced by up to one half. courts have used this article as the basis for imposing increased sentences for supposedly criminal activity with little evidence either of the commission of a recognizably criminal offence or any demonstrable link to a ‘ terrorist organization as with direct membership cases the evidence presented for having committed a crime ‘ in the name of an organization frequently amounts to nothing more than participation in demonstrations or the writing of pro-kurdish articles amnesty international considers that is neither necessary for the prosecution of individuals for genuinely terrorist-related offences nor in practice applied in such a way as to uphold the right to freedom of expression amnesty international therefore recommends that the article be repealed and that legitimate prosecutions be brought instead under other existing penal code articles requiring proof of membership or intent to assist a terrorist organization,case originated application republic turkey lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention turkish

the schmidt and dahlström case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights hereinafter referred to as the commission the case originated in an application against the lodged with the commission by two swedish subjects mr. folke schmidt and mr. hans dahlström on june the commission s request to which was attached the report provided for under article art of the convention was lodged with the registry of the court on october within the period of three months laid down by articles para and art art the request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration made by the recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the purpose of the commission s request is to obtain a decision from the court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a failure on the part of the kingdom of sweden to comply with the obligations binding on it under articles and art art of the convention the president of the court deemed it conducive to the proper administration of justice to constitute a single chamber to consider both the present case and that of the swedish engine drivers union rule para on october the president of the court drew by lot in the presence of the registrar the names of five of the seven judges required to sit as members of the chamber mr. s. petrén the judge of swedish nationality and mr. g. balladore pallieri the president of the court being ex officio members under article art of the convention and rule para b of the rules of court respectively the five judges so selected were mr. h. mosler mr. e. rodenbourg mr. a. favre mr. g. wiarda and mr. p. o donoghue article in fine of the convention and rule para art mr. favre died in november and mr. rodenbourg in october they were replaced by mr. j. cremona and mrs. h. pedersen substitute judges g. balladore pallieri assumed the office of president of the chamber in accordance with rule para the president of the chamber ascertained through the registrar the views of the agent of the swedish government hereinafter referred to as the government and of the delegates of the commission regarding the procedure to be followed by an order of october the president of the chamber decided that the government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on february and that the delegates should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the government s memorial the government s memorial was received at the registry on february and that of the delegates on march after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission the president decided by an order of june that the oral hearings should open on september on september the court held a preparatory meeting to consider the oral stage of the procedure on this occasion the court compiled a list of questions which it sent to the parties appearing before it requesting them to supply the required information in the course of their addresses the court also requested the commission to produce a certain document the oral hearings were held in public at the human rights building in on september there appeared before the court for the government for the commission the court heard the addresses of mr. fawcett and mr. schmidt for the commission and mr. danelius for the government as well as their replies to questions put by the court and several judges at the hearing the commission produced the document recently called for by the court the applicants are swedish citizens mr. folke schmidt is a professor of law at the and mr. hans dahlström is an officer in the swedish army the applicants are members of trade unions affiliated to two of the main federations representing employees namely the swedish confederation of professional associations sveriges akademikers centralorganisation abbreviated to saco in the case of mr. schmidt and the national federation of state employees statstjänstemännens riksförbund abbreviated to sr in the case of mr. dahlström in after expiry of one collective agreement and during negotiations for a new agreement the applicants unions called selective strikes not affecting the sectors in which worked the applicants who thus did not come out on strike mr. schmidt and mr. dahlström complain that on conclusion of the new agreement they as members of the belligerent unions were denied certain retroactive benefits paid to members of other trade unions and to non-union employees who had not participated in the strikes general background for more than a hundred years workers and employers in the private sector in have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and associations and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the state certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in and by the following legislation i the collective agreements act lag om kollektivavtal ii the act lag om arbetsdomstol and iii the act on the right to organise and negotiate lag om förenings-och förhandlingsrätt the collective agreement act deals with collective labour agreements between employers or employers associations and trade unions it specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements for example the parties may not take strike or lock-out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them the labour court act contained rules governing the composition jurisdiction and procedure of the the was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of the act on the right to organise and negotiate it also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation or application of collective agreements but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue unions or non-union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable paragraph below were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts as the case might be the above-mentioned act of guarantees two distinct rights to the parties on the labour market namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate the right to organise is defined in section of the act as being the right of employers and employees to belong to an employers organisation or a trade union to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union without interference or pressure by the other party the act specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer as the case may be to refrain from becoming a member of or to resign from an association to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer as the case may be on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association the only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the act is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as intervention in the affairs of the association the right to negotiate is defined in section of the act as being the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general it imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations to attend meetings for negotiations and where necessary to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved this provision is applicable to all trade unions prior to the state determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the state and the employees as from january the state officials act statstjänstemannalag has virtually assimilated state employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights strikes lock-outs etc the act made the collective agreement act the act and the act on the right to organise and negotiate applicable in the public sector furthermore the act provided for collective agreements to be concluded subject to certain exceptions between the national collective bargaining office statens avtalsverk hereinafter referred to as the office representing the state as employer and the organisations of state employees the ministry of finance has a nominee on the governing board of the office the legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the swedish trade union movement one factor which greatly contributed to its adoption was the conclusion in december of a basic agreement on negotiations procedure slottsbacksavtalet between the office and the four main trade union organisations of state employees namely i the state employees union statsanställdas förbund abbreviated to sf and known prior to july as statstjänarkartellen ii the national federation of state employees sr iii the swedish confederation of professional associations saco iv the civil servants section of the central organisation of salaried employees tjänstemännens centralorganisations statstjänstemannasektion abbreviated to tco-s according to the information at the disposal of the court these federations represent the large majority of employees more than out of the whose terms of employment are negotiated by the office about forty trade unions are affiliated to these organisations the few independent trade unions represent only about state employees in all insofar as they are union members at all university teachers and army officers generally belong to saco and sr respectively these two organisations which are respectively open to staff possessing a university degree or the school leaving certificate the equivalent of the baccalauréat recently merged after the case had been brought before the commission according to the trade unions own published figures the number of saco members in respect of whom the office conducts collective negotiations was about in and it rose to in and was between and at the end of the university teachers union affiliated to saco had between and members in between and in between and in and between and at the end of sr had members in in and about at the end of the army officers union affiliated to sr had between and members in in and between and at the end of it would appear that in august its membership had fallen to about or clause of the above-mentioned basic agreement provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees behalf by the main organisation concerned unless the office and the main organisation agree otherwise the royal order of june relating to certain public collective agreements kk om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m includes the following provisions article collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the king-in-council or by parliament shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the king-in-council article an authority which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement collective agreements in are normally concluded for a period of two or three years for various reasons however the new collective agreement is often concluded some time after the previous agreement has expired in such cases the new agreement has often specifically provided that its terms shall apply retroactively as from the date of expiry of the previous agreement in the case of a strike during the bargaining period on the other hand employers both in the public and private sector have customarily refused to grant retroactive benefits in order to deter unions from taking industrial action in the future application of the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity negotiations in the public sector of the labour market are centralised in that they are conducted by the federations on behalf of their member unions moreover strikes and other collective action may not be taken by the different trade unions independently but rather on the basis of a decision by or after receiving the approval of the federation concerned which chooses and designates in accordance with its pre-arranged policy or tactics those of its members who are to take part in the action according to the present practice the negotiations between the office and the federations result in one single agreement which regulates the increase in salaries the grading of different categories of employees working hours various salary allowances etc. and which applies as a result of article of the order referred to above paragraph to all categories of state employees including those who are not represented by the federations the agreement is normally signed by all the federations the question whether an individual employee has any means of challenging his union s decision to go on strike is a matter exclusively governed by the internal rules of the union concerned these may provide for a right to ask for a secret ballot or for other rights to object to the union s decisions to take industrial action the law described above at paragraphs to has in recent years undergone various changes which being subsequent to the facts at issue are not relevant for the present case facts of the particular case in a global agreement for the years and was concluded by the office and the four federations when this period expired on december the parties were still engaged in negotiations regarding the new global agreement no agreement was reached and a commission of conciliation was appointed but negotiations before it broke down as well consequently saco and sr proclaimed selective strikes which became effective on february and involved about members this resort to strike action which was quite lawful see paragraphs and above did not apply to university teachers or the army so that neither mr. schmidt nor mr. dahlström took any part in the strikes the office retaliated and on february about members of saco and sr were locked out this affected all university teachers belonging to saco including mr. schmidt and some officers belonging to sr but not mr. dahlström new strikes and lock-outs were proclaimed but did not become effective on march an act was promulgated which gave the king-in-council power to order the prolongation of certain collective agreements for a period of six weeks but not extending beyond april provided that collective industrial action threatened vital public interests by virtue of this act the previous collective agreement was reinstated on march for a period of six weeks and all strikes and lock-outs terminated forthwith subsequent negotiations before the commission of conciliation resulted in june in a new global agreement for the years to according to this agreement certain posts were upgraded and the salary scales were generally increased retroactively as from january clause however provided for an exception in this respect officials who were members between january and march or any part of this period of organisations that organised industrial action for any part of this period shall not be entitled from january to march to the increased wage benefits applicable under the agreement unless the collective bargaining office decides otherwise this declaration also concerns other officials if they took part in any such industrial action the agreement was only signed by tco-s and sf saco and sr refused since they considered the terms unacceptable the agreement and in particular clause was nevertheless applied to their members by virtue of article of the above-mentioned royal order paragraph according to the applicants during the negotiations sf and tco-s had urged that the non-retroactivity clause should not be included in the agreement and expressed the opinion that it properly belonged to an agreement between the state and the two organisations concerned saco and sr. sf and tco-s declared this expressly and inserted a reservation in the record before putting their signatures to the agreement tco-s had however attempted to entice to itself some members of saco which was in its opinion a purposeless organisation and had in fact written to the applicant schmidt in this vein as a result of the agreement members of saco and sr insofar as they were upgraded did not receive the higher salary for the period from january to march nor did they benefit from the general increase in the salary scales during the same period regardless of whether or not they had been on strike state employees who were not members of saco or sr but who had all the same participated in the strike were also refused the benefit of retroactivity the exception clause applied to both applicants as members of saco and sr even though they themselves had not gone on strike at all mr. schmidt was affected for the period from january to february being the date when he was locked out and thus deprived of his salary mr. dahlström who was upgraded under the new agreement was affected for the whole period up to march during these periods the applicants performed work for a lower salary than that paid to other employees who were in the same salary brackets but not members of saco or sr. their financial losses amounted to kr and kr respectively mr. schmidt following the conclusion of the collective agreement gave notice to the office that through his special treatment in regard to wages his right to organise had been violated when the office nevertheless refused him the benefit of retroactivity saco and sr brought an action against the state before the labour court under the act on the right to organise and negotiate seeking on behalf of the applicants and a third person who was also a member of sr inter alia i a declaration that the measures taken by the office constituted a violation of the applicants right to organise and that this involved an interference with the affairs of saco and sr ii a declaration that clause of the agreement of june was of no effect in regard to the applicants iii an order that the state pay compensation to the applicants for financial loss and infringement of their right to organise saco and sr asserted that the state had infringed their members right to organise as guaranteed in section of the act since with regard to retroactive wage benefits they were subjected to special treatment in comparison with members of tco-s and sf and non-union officials the office denied any such infringement since members of saco and sr had been refused the benefit of retroactivity only for the reason that the state wanted to maintain the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity a comparison between saco and sr members on the one side and members of tco-s and sf and non-union officials on the other did not provide any basis for the conclusion that the state acted on such a basis or with such a purpose as was envisaged by section of the act in its judgment of december the unanimously rejected the claim of the applicants unions the court first confirmed the parties common view that the right to organise did not exclude the possibility for the state to enforce the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity the adoption of such a position and its enforcement after a conflict were not to be regarded in themselves as an attack on the right to organise furthermore the employer s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non-union employees or to members of different organisations the mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating section had been employed however any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non-union employees with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in section would constitute a violation of that provision the court then found that no such purpose on the part of the state could be established in particular no support had appeared for the idea that the state intended to induce members of saco and sr to switch over to tco-s and sf in this context the court assumed that the latter organisations would also have been refused retroactivity if they had organised industrial action during the process of negotiations with respect to non-union employees the court found that the reason why they were granted a special benefit had nothing to do with their position as being non-union any procedure designed to refuse the benefit of retroactivity generally to non-union employees in sectors where saco and sr were dominant or representative obviously could have become very complicated and time-consuming moreover no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed the court then referred to the state s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non-union employees within the sectors in which saco and sr were representative in this respect the court considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the state to violate the right to organise otherwise the state would as soon as one federation organised industrial action be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations such a general limitation of the state s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on section of the act in the case before it the court did not consider the granting of retroactive benefits to non-union employees who had not been on strike as proof of any purpose to violate the right to organise in the court s opinion the parties had not been able to present anything more than quite uncertain information on the total number of non-union officials or on their field of employment the court indicated that the plaintiffs view concerning the state s purpose in its treatment of non-union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non-union officials were active within the main field of activity of saco and sr. conversely it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non-union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of sf and tco-s the uncertainty in regard to these circumstances argued in the court s conclusion in favour of the states declaration that its purpose did not extend beyond upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in their application lodged with the commission on june the applicants complained that in the particular circumstances the implementation of the government s policy regarding payment of retroactive benefits had amounted to preferential treatment in particular in comparison with non-union employees and had consequently violated article art of the convention the commission declared the application admissible by a decision of october during the examination of the merits the applicants relied on article art and also article read in conjunction with article art in its report of july the commission i confirmed its opinion previously expressed in the report in the swedish engine drivers union case that article para art may legitimately extend to cover state responsibility in the field of labour-management relations and thus to provide some protection for unions against interference by employers ii expressed the opinion by nine votes to one with one abstention that the government s policy of denying retroactive benefits to non-striking members of belligerent unions did not in the circumstances infringe the applicants right under article para art to form and join the trade unions that in view of the preceding finding the commission was not called upon to examine whether the action complained of was justified under article para art by eight votes to one with two abstentions that the differential treatment complained of was in the circumstances justified as an industrial relations policy and that there had been no violation of article read in conjunction with article para art the report contains a separate concurring

the case originated in two applications nos and against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two political parties herri batasuna and batasuna the applicant parties on july the applicant parties were represented before the court by mr d. rouget a lawyer practising in saint-jean-de-luz the spanish government the government were represented by their agent mr i. blasco head of the legal department for human rights ministry of justice relying on articles and of the convention the applicant parties alleged in particular that their dissolution had entailed a violation of their right to freedom of expression and of their right to freedom of association they complained that institutional law no on political parties ley orgánica de partidos políticos the lopp of june which they described as an ad hoc law was neither accessible nor foreseeable had been applied retrospectively and that their dissolution had pursued no legitimate aim but had been intended in their view to silence any debate and to deprive them of their freedom of expression they considered that the measure imposed on them had not been necessary in a democratic society and that it was incompatible with the principle of proportionality lastly the first applicant party observed that the acts referred to in the judgment of the spanish supreme court of march against the applicant parties had taken place one year before the lopp had come into force and that herri batasuna had been dissolved even though the supreme court had not found it guilty of any such act occurring after the relevant law had come into force in those circumstances it had to be concluded that the law had been applied to it retrospectively the chamber to which the case had been allocated decided to join the applications rule of the rules of court by a decision of december the chamber declared the applications partly admissible on july the chamber notified the parties of its intention to relinquish the case to the grand chamber in accordance with rule relying on rule the government objected to that relinquishment accordingly the chamber continued to examine the case the applicant parties and the government filed additional observations rule the chamber decided after having consulted the parties that it was not necessary to hold a hearing on the merits of the case rule in fine the first applicant the political party herri batasuna was founded on june the second applicant the political party batasuna was founded on may on june the spanish parliament enacted institutional law no on political parties ley orgánica de partidos políticos the lopp according to its explanatory memorandum that law was intended to develop articles and of the spanish constitution by amending and updating law no of december on political parties regard being had to the experience acquired over the years and to establish a complete and coherent framework for political parties reflecting their role in a consolidated democracy the main innovations introduced by the new law appeared in chapter ii on the organisation functioning and activities of political parties and in chapter iii on their dissolution and suspension by the courts of their activities chapter ii lays down the basic criteria intended to ensure compliance with the constitutional requirement that the organisation and operation of political parties be democratic and that they may freely engage in their activities in accordance with the constitution and the law section requires parties to respect democratic principles and human rights describing in detail the type of conduct that would be in breach of the principles in question according to the explanatory memorandum the law is based on the principle that any project or objective is constitutional provided that it is not pursued by means of activities which breach democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens the law is not intended to prohibit the defence of ideas or doctrines calling into question the constitutional framework its aim is rather to reconcile freedom and pluralism with respect for human rights and the protection of democracy the explanatory memorandum states that a party may be dissolved only in the event of repeated or accumulated acts which unequivocally prove the existence of undemocratic conduct at odds with democracy and in breach of constitutional values democracy and the rights of citizens in that connection sub-paragraphs a b and c of paragraph of section draw a clear distinction between organisations which defend their ideas or programmes whatever they may be in strict compliance with democratic methods and principles and those whose political activity is based on an accommodation with violence political support for terrorist organisations or violation of the rights of citizens or democratic principles chapter iii sets out the grounds on which political parties may be dissolved or their activities suspended by order of the court and describes the applicable procedure in the courts the law invests the special chamber of the supreme court established by section of the judicature act ley orgánica del poder judicial the lopj with jurisdiction for the dissolution of political parties furthermore provision is made for specific priority proceedings involving a single level of jurisdiction which may be brought only by the public prosecutor s office or the government of their own motion or at the request of the chamber of deputies or the senate according to the lopp s explanatory memorandum the proceedings in question are intended to reconcile the principle of legal certainty and the rights of the defence with the principle of promptness and a reasonable time-limit the judgment delivered by the supreme court upon completion of those proceedings may be challenged only by way of an amparo appeal to the section details the effects of the court-ordered dissolution of a political party once the judgment has been served the dissolved party must cease all activity furthermore it may not set up a political organisation or use an existing party with a view to pursuing the activities of the party that has been declared illegal and dissolved in order to rule as to whether or not there is any continuity between an existing party and a party which has been dissolved the supreme court has regard to whether any substantial similarity exists between the structure organisation and operation of the parties in question or other evidence such as the identity of their members or leaders their funding or their support for violence or terrorism the assets of a dissolved political party are liquidated and transferred to the treasury to be used for social and humanitarian purposes the lopp was published in the official gazette of the state on june and came into force the following day the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows founded as an electoral coalition the political organisation herri batasuna took part in the general elections of march the first elections in following the entry into force of the constitution on june it was entered into the register of political parties at the ministry of the interior following the supreme court s sentencing on december of twenty-three members of herri batasuna s national directorate to imprisonment for collaboration with an armed organisation euskal herritarrok eh was set up on september to stand in the basque elections of october initially as an association of voters and then as a political party on may batasuna filed documents at the register of political parties seeking registration as a political party on september the basque autonomous government brought an action before the constitutional court challenging the constitutionality of the lopp criticising in particular sections and and chapter iii sections to and paragraph of the sole transitional provision of that law by a judgment of march the constitutional court declared the impugned law constitutional as regards the very existence of such a law making provision for the dissolution of political parties and its purpose which according to the basque government consisted of establishing a model of militant democracy imposing restrictions on political parties in particular by imposing on them an obligation not provided for in the constitution to accept a given political regime or system the constitutional court stated according to the applicant government the argument set out above is based on references in certain paragraphs of sections and of the lopp to the ‘ constitutional values expressed in constitutional principles and human rights section to ‘ democratic principles sections and to the ‘ system of liberties and to the ‘ democratic system sections and sub-paragraph c to the ‘ constitutional order and to ‘ public peace section sub-paragraph c despite the fact that the legal significance of those references can be grasped only in the context of each of the provisions containing them and that each of the provisions in question must in turn be interpreted in the light of the law and of the legal system as a whole the basque government s submission that there is no place in our constitutional order for a model of ‘ militant democracy within the meaning given to that expression by the government namely a model in which not only compliance with but also positive acceptance of the established order and first and foremost the constitution is required must be endorsed the impugned law allows for no such model of democracy right at the outset the explanatory memorandum lays down the principle of a distinction between the ideas and aims proclaimed by political parties on the one hand and their activities on the other and states that ‘ the only aims explicitly vetoed are those which fall within the criminal law so that ‘ any project or objective is deemed to be constitutional provided that it is not pursued by means of activities which breach democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens consequently and as regards the aspect which is of particular interest here the law lists as grounds for illegality ‘ conduct that is to say acts of political parties which through their activities and not through the ultimate aims proclaimed in their manifestos fail to satisfy the requirements of article of the constitution which the impugned law merely mentions secondly and most importantly it is clear that the principles and values to which the law refers can be none other than those proclaimed by the constitution and that their content and scope depend on the meaning arising out of the interpretation of the positive constitutional provisions as a whole thus in our system ‘ democratic principles can only be principles specific to the democratic order arising out of the institutional and normative fabric woven by the constitution the actual functioning of which leads to a system of powers rights and balances giving form to a variant of the democratic model which is precisely that assumed by the constitution in establishing spain as a social and democratic state governed by the rule of law article of the constitution as regards the applicant parties argument that the provisions of the law namely some of the cases referred to in section tacit support for example established a militant democracy in breach of the fundamental rights of freedom of ideology participation expression and information the constitutional court stated the system established by the first three paragraphs of section of the lopp must firstly be described the first paragraph refers not to a positive adherence of any kind but to simple respect for constitutional values which must be demonstrated by political parties when engaging in their activities and which is compatible with the broadest ideological freedom paragraph provides that a political party may be declared illegal only ‘ when as a result of its activities it infringes democratic principles in particular when it seeks thereby to impair or to destroy the system of liberties to hinder or to put an end to the democratic system by repeatedly and seriously engaging in any of the conduct described below lastly sub-paragraphs a b and c list the general criteria for a party to be declared illegal on account of its activities as regards paragraph of section of the lopp the flawed drafting of its introduction might suggest that the instances of behaviour described by that provision are in addition to those specified in the preceding paragraph and that they must therefore be interpreted separately however an interpretation of these two provisions taken together and an interpretation of the whole section which contains them show that the instances of behaviour described in paragraph of section have the general features described in paragraph of the same section the instances of behaviour referred to in section of the law merely specify or clarify the principal causes of illegality set out in general terms in section of the law a separate interpretation and application of such conduct can be done only on the basis of the cases provided for in section that having been said while it is not for the constitutional court to determine whether or not mere failure to condemn terrorist acts can be construed as implicit support for terrorism it is clear that symbolic actions can be used in certain circumstances to legitimise terrorist acts or excuse or minimise their anti-democratic effects and implicit violation of fundamental rights in such circumstances it is plainly impossible to speak of a violation of the right to freedom of expression the same can be said in general of sub-paragraph c of section of the lopp which provides ‘ where through its activities it repeatedly and seriously violates democratic principles or seeks to impair or to destroy the system of liberties or to hinder the democratic system or to put an end to it by means of the conduct referred to in section it must also be stated in this regard that that provision concerns only the activities of political parties and in no way extends to their aims or objectives the wording of that provision shows therefore that only those parties which through their activities rather than their ideology effectively and proactively seek to ‘ impair or to destroy the system of liberties are liable to be dissolved. as regards the basque government s complaint that the dissolution measure prescribed by law was disproportionate the constitutional court stated taken separately none of the conduct described in section of the lopp can entail a party s dissolution in order for that measure to be pronounced as stated in section the conduct in question must be engaged in ‘ repeatedly and seriously secondly it must be pointed out that the existence of a party which through its activities collaborates with or supports terrorist violence jeopardises the survival of the pluralist order proclaimed by the constitution and that faced with that danger dissolution would appear to be the only sanction capable of repairing the damage done to the legal order lastly it must be stressed that article of the constitution contains a definition of a party according to the constitution a party may only be considered a party if it is the expression of political pluralism consequently it is quite acceptable constitutionally for a party whose activities undermine pluralism and to a greater or lesser extent destabilise the democratic order to be dissolved similarly the european court of human rights has considered that even though the margin of appreciation left to states must be a narrow one where the dissolution of political parties is concerned where the pluralism of ideas and parties inherent in democracy is in danger a state may forestall the execution of a policy at the root of that danger refah partisi the welfare party and others v. turkey nos and july it is not sufficient to establish the existence of just one of the acts described by the law on the contrary those acts need to be engaged in ‘ repeatedly and seriously section or ‘ repeatedly or cumulatively section to conclude the relevant provisions describe particularly serious conduct and establish as grounds for dissolution only those which are manifestly incompatible with the peaceful and lawful means which are an essential part of the process of political participation to which the constitution requires political parties to lend their qualified support the criteria established by the case-law of the european court of human rights as regards the dissolution of political parties have therefore been complied with united communist party of turkey and others v. turkey january reports of judgments and decisions socialist party and others v. turkey may reports freedom and democracy party özdep v. turkey gc no echr refah partisi the welfare party and others v. turkey nos and july and gc echr yazar and others v. turkey nos and echr and dicle for the democratic party dep of turkey v. turkey no december that case-law states that in order to comply with the european convention on human rights the dissolution of a party must satisfy certain criteria namely a the law must include the circumstances and causes of dissolution that criterion is clearly satisfied by the rules at issue since they are set out in a formal law b the aim pursued must be legitimate which as indicated above consists in the instant case of protecting the democratic process of political participation through the exclusion of any associative organisation which could be likened to a party exercising an activity not falling within the constitutional definition of political parties and c the dissolution must be ‘ necessary in a democratic society demonstrated in the context of the foregoing analysis of the specific causes of dissolution provided for by law the fact that convicted terrorists are regularly appointed to positions of leadership or entered on lists of candidates for election may appear to constitute an expression of support for terrorist methods which goes against the obligations imposed by the constitution on all political parties furthermore the fact that such a practice can be taken into account only if the convicted terrorists have not ‘ publicly rejected terrorist aims and methods can not be interpreted as an obligation to disavow earlier activities the provision in question section c is of prospective effect only and applies only to political parties which are led by convicted terrorists or whose candidates are convicted terrorists it lays down as a cause of dissolution the regular use of people who may legitimately be assumed to sympathise with terrorist methods rather than with any ideas and programmes that terrorist organisations might seek to implement lastly as regards the basque government s complaint that the principle of non-retrospectivity in relation to section of the lopp and paragraph of the sole transitional provision had been violated the constitutional court held for the purposes of applying section of the lopp which lists the factors that can be taken into account in assessing and characterising activities that may give rise to the dissolution of a political party the aforementioned paragraph characterises as unlawful ‘ the establishment on a date immediately preceding or following the date of entry into force of a political party which pursues the activities of another party or succeeds that party with a view to evading application of the provisions of this law in respect of it worded as it is that provision can not be held to be unconstitutional as it is quite clear that its sole purpose is to enable section of the lopp to be applied ‘ to activities pursued after the entry into force of this institutional law as stated therein in no circumstances does it make provision for the judging of activities and acts prior to the lopp since only those subsequent to the entry into force of the law are deemed to be relevant in other words the law specifically states that the various causes that may lead to dissolution of a party may be taken into account only after its entry into force the activities considered separately and ‘ the continuing nature or repetition of the activities mentioned in section to which the transitional provision refers are subsequent to the entry into force of the lopp that said for the purposes of determining the significance of those activities and assessing their relevance to the overall conduct of the party concerned and for that purpose only since to take account of conduct pre-dating the effective date of the law in order to justify a declaration of unlawfulness would be unconstitutional because it would constitute a breach of the principle of non-retrospectivity enshrined in article of the constitution it is perfectly possible to take into consideration what the law refers to as the ‘ trajectory section of the party in question which trajectory could encompass acts prior to the entry into force of the law but that can not in any way be considered as a retrospective effect under the constitution. the also rejected the complaints based on the principle of non bis in idem the lack of foreseeability and the exceptional nature of the law the specific features of the judicial proceedings and the allegations concerning the system for founding and registering political parties accordingly it dismissed the applicant parties claims stating in paragraph of its reasoning that sections and and paragraph of the sole transitional provision of the lopp were constitutional only if interpreted in accordance with the terms set out in paragraphs and of the reasoning of its judgment the government of the autonomous community of the basque country subsequently lodged an application with the court no which was declared inadmissible on the ground of incompatibility ratione personae on february meanwhile by a decision of august delivered in the context of criminal proceedings for illegal association article of the spanish criminal code central investigating judge no at the audiencia nacional had ordered the suspension of batasuna s activities and the closure for three years of any headquarters and offices that could be used by herri batasuna and batasuna the same measure was applied to eh which is not an applicant before the court on september implementing an agreement adopted by the council of ministers on august the attorney-general abogado del estado lodged an application with the supreme court on behalf of the spanish government for the dissolution of the political parties herri batasuna eh and batasuna on the ground that they had breached the new lopp on account of various acts which conclusively demonstrated conduct inconsistent with democracy constitutional values democratic practice and the rights of citizens on the same day state counsel procurador general also filed an application with the supreme court with a view to the dissolution of the political parties herri batasuna eh and batasuna in accordance with sections et seq of the lopp in his application he asked the supreme court to find that the parties in question were illegal and order that they be removed from the register of political parties that they immediately cease their activities and that the effects of the law be extended to any party newly created in breach of the law or succeeding any of the parties concerned that their assets be liquidated and that they be dissolved in accordance with section of the lopp on march batasuna sought the referral of a preliminary question to the constitutional court concerning the constitutionality of the lopp as it was of the view that the law as a whole and several of the sections thereof taken separately violated the rights to freedom of association freedom of expression and freedom of thought and the principles of lawfulness legal certainty non-retrospectivity of less favourable criminal laws proportionality and non bis in idem as well as the right to take part in public affairs by a unanimous judgment of march the supreme court refused to refer batasuna s question to the constitutional court pointing out that that organisation s challenges to the constitutionality of the lopp had already been examined and rejected in the constitutional court s judgment of march it declared herri batasuna eh and batasuna illegal and pronounced their dissolution under sections and of the lopp on the ground that they were part of a terrorist strategy of ‘ tactical separation it considered that significant similarities between the three parties at issue and between them and the terrorist organisation eta three organisations having substantially the same ideology and moreover tightly controlled by that terrorist organisation had been established it concluded that in reality there existed a single entity namely the terrorist organisation eta hidden behind an apparent plurality of legal entities created at different times according to an ‘ operational succession devised in advance by that organisation it also liquidated the assets of the parties at issue in accordance with section c of the same law the supreme court noted in its judgment that while political parties constituted the essential foundations of political pluralism they had to engage in their activities and pursue their aims and objectives in accordance with the law and democratic processes stating that activities involving the use of violence or restricting the fundamental rights of others could not be tolerated the supreme court referred to the spanish constitutional system which in its view unlike other legal systems did not constitute a model of militant democracy since the only condition imposed on the expression of differences was respect for the rights of others it pointed out that the lopp recognised that any project or objective was constitutional provided that it was not pursued by means of activities which breach ed democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens in that regard it pointed out that by law political parties were liable to be declared illegal only on the basis of activities consisting of serious and repeated conduct in the instant case according to the supreme court the calls to violence justifying the restriction of the freedoms of the parties at issue stemmed from a deliberate apportionment of tasks between terrorism and politics eta devising justification of the need for terrorism as one of the functions entrusted to herri batasuna bearing in mind the historical and social context of the fight against terrorism in the supreme court held that the terrorist organisation eta and its satellite organisation koordinadora abertzale sozialista kas had been directing herri batasuna since its creation to reach that conclusion it relied on evidence demonstrating the existence of hierarchical links between the three organisations and revealing in particular that kas as eta s delegate had controlled the process of appointing the most senior members of herri batasuna and its successors eh and batasuna and had participated in it the supreme court held that herri batasuna had been created in response to eta s wish to split armed activity and mass activity organically and structurally which resulted in clear hierarchical submission of the parties at issue to the terrorist organisation eta in that connection it referred to a kas internal document which read as follows kas considers that armed struggle in association with mass struggle and institutional struggle the latter serving the former is the key to the advance and triumph of the revolution mass struggle likewise requires an historical alliance of popular unity the physical manifestation of which is herri batasuna. as regards the operational succession held to exist between the three political parties that had been declared illegal the supreme court relied on the fact that the people occupying posts of responsibility within the three organisations notably their spokesperson a.o and belonging to different parliamentary groups were the same it also took account of the existence of premises used by all the parties at issue as regards links between the applicant parties and the terrorist organisation eta it noted that several of their members in particular their spokesperson a.o. had been convicted of terrorism-related offences the supreme court held that the evidence set out below subsequent to the date of entry into force of the lopp showed that the applicant political parties were instruments of eta s terrorist strategy on july batasuna had refused to appoint representatives to the basque parliamentary committee responsible for the situation and needs of victims of terrorism as it considered it to be political manipulated and biased on july reacting to the decision of central investigating judge no at the audiencia nacional by which batasuna had been declared civilly liable for damage caused by street violence kale borroka a.o. the spokesperson for that organisation had exhorted the basque people to respond energetically to this new attack and had criticised the decision for having provoked a serious and anti-democratic situation on july during a commemoration of the battle of monte albertia a.o had made the following statement we must continue to work and to struggle either within or outside the law the reality is that we will not falter because we are at a point in history where the process we have undertaken must be rendered irreversible. on july the mayor and a batasuna councillor of the municipality of lezo had taken part in a demonstration in support of eta terrorists living in venezuela on july at a gathering outside the san sebastian navy command a batasuna municipal spokesperson referred to as j.l. had explained that the purpose of that demonstration was to let the state authorities know that they could not move around with impunity in euskal herria on july j.e.b. batsuna s spokesperson in the municipality of vitoria had stated that batasuna didn t want eta to stop killing but did not want euskal herria to have recourse to any kind of violence and wanted those who engaged in it to cease to exist at a plenary session of the municipal council on july batasuna had refused to condemn the campaign of threats against councillors of the basque socialist party pse-ee in the municipality of amorebieta at a press conference on august concerning the potential handover to spain of k.b. an eta member convicted in france the mayor and the chairman of the human rights committee of the municipality of ondarroa l.a. and a.a. batasuna members had declared that they supported k.b and all those who were in the same situation batasuna and its leaders had refused to condemn the santa pola attack of august in which two people had died in that regard during a press conference in pamplona a.o had described that event as a painful consequence of the failure to solve the political conflict in the basque country and had accused the spanish prime minister then j.m aznar of bearing the greatest responsibility for what had happened at that time and what might happen in future municipalities run by batasuna and that party s website had used an anagram of gestoras pro-amnistía an organisation that had been declared illegal by central investigating judge no at the audiencia nacional and was on the european list of terrorist organisations council common position at a demonstration organised by batasuna in san sebastian on august and run by batasuna s leaders a.o. j.p. and j.a. slogans supporting eta prisoners and threatening expressions such as borroka da bide bakarra the struggle is the only way zuek faxistak zarete terroristak you the fascists are the real terrorists or gora eta militarra long live eta military had been used on and august batasuna-run town halls had put up placards on their facades supporting terrorism or those engaging in terrorism alluding to the transfer of basque prisoners to the basque country and showing photographs of several terrorists at a batasuna press conference held in bilbao on august a.o had criticised the spanish state s genocide strategy and proclaimed that the basque people were going to organise themselves and fight so that some little spanish fascist could never again tell basques what their institutions should be he had also warned the government of the autonomous community of the basque country nationalist government coalition that if it took part in closing down batasuna headquarters the result would be an unwanted scenario expressions which had been interpreted the following day by the media as a threat against the basque executive during an interview with the newspaper egunkaria on august j.u. batasuna s representative in the basque parliament had stated that eta did not support armed struggle for the fun of it but that it was an organisation conscious of the need to use every means possible to confront the state on august at a batasuna meeting held in bilbao following the demonstration organised by that party against its dissolution j.p. had criticised the leaders of the basque nationalist party for abiding by spanish law accusing them of lacking national dignity he had also encouraged the participants to go out into the street and respond vigorously municipalities governed by the parties in question had advocated terrorist activities as evidenced by the fact that two eta terrorists had been made honorary citizens hijo predilecto by the municipalities of legazpia and zaldibia since june batasuna council representatives in vitoria and lasarte-oria had been committing acts of harassment against the representatives of non-nationalist parties thus contributing to a climate of civil confrontation municipalities governed by batasuna had displayed sketches and placards calling for a struggle against the state against representatives of state power against other political parties or members of those parties notably the prime minister of the spanish government and the leaders of the partido popular and the spanish socialist party after the entry into force of the lopp the three parties at issue had continued to pursue the same strategy of complementing on a political level the actions of the terrorist organisation eta in the context of a jointly organised operational succession relying on the above evidence the supreme court held that the activity of the applicant political parties as manifested through conduct in line with a strategy predefined by the terrorist organisation eta consisted of providing assistance and political support to the actions of terrorist organisations with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order or seriously disturbing the public peace within the meaning of section c of the lopp it concluded that the conduct of which the applicant parties had been accused corresponded to the cases referred to in sub-paragraphs a b d f and h of paragraph of section of that law it stated firstly that some of the conduct described such as batasuna s demonstration in san sebastian where pro-eta slogans had been heard could be characterised as explicit political support for terrorism while other conduct such as the refusal of batasuna and its leaders to condemn the santa pola attack of august sought to justify terrorist actions and minimise their importance and the violation of the fundamental rights arising therefrom in that connection the supreme court stated in the constitutional context the existence of political parties which from an intellectual point of view fail to take a clear and unequivocal stance against terrorist activities or which with calculated ambiguity systematically seek to conceal the fact that they do not disavow criminal acts by officially deploring the consequences thereof without however censuring in any way the barbaric behaviour of those who cause such acts through the use of violence to achieve their objectives can not be tolerated for the purposes of these proceedings the repeated strategic and systematic silence of a political party concerning terrorist activities can only be interpreted from a political and constitutional viewpoint as a clear sign of their ‘ acceptance by omission or ‘ implicit acceptance that is as their alignment with the arguments of the perpetrators of those criminal actions and the tacit acceptance of violence as a means of achieving set objectives which in our constitutional system can only be achieved by peaceful means. the court held secondly that other conduct of which the applicant parties had been accused such as the harassment of representatives of non-nationalist parties in the municipalities of vitoria and lasarte-oria had contributed to the emergence of a climate of civil confrontation intended to intimidate opponents of terrorism and deprive them of their freedom of opinion it observed thirdly that conduct such as publicly describing eta prisoners as political prisoners or using the anagram of gestoras pro-amnistía proved that the parties at issue were using symbols reflecting terrorism or violence it noted lastly that the applicant parties had also taken part in activities in praise of terrorist activities turning to the need for and the proportionality of the dissolution of the applicant parties the supreme court pointed out that it was taking account of the text of the convention and of the court s case-law which would serve as a guide in the interpretation of fundamental constitutional rights in accordance with article of the spanish constitution it considered that in view of the applicant parties frequent calls to violence as established by the above-mentioned evidence the measure to dissolve the applicant parties had been justified for the purposes of protecting the fundamental rights of others a necessary element of democracy the supreme court referred in particular to the court s judgment in refah partisi the welfare party and others v. turkey gc nos and echr considering that that judgment imposed on parties claiming to exercise functions in a democratic society a real legal duty to distance themselves from any ambiguous or unclear messages as to the use of violence ibid. it pointed out furthermore that the calls to violence at issue in the case before it appeared to be more explicit than those at issue in the case submitted to the court batasuna and herri batasuna lodged two amparo appeals with the against the judgment of the supreme court in their appeals they complained firstly of the lack of impartiality of the president of the supreme court who had been the reporting judge in the proceedings leading to their dissolution even though he was the president of the judicial council the body which had issued a favourable report on the bill resulting in the law at issue they submitted that the conflation of jurisdictional and consultative functions in one person had resulted in a loss of objective impartiality batasuna relied in that regard on article of the constitution right to a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal secondly the applicant parties alleged that the guarantees of a fair trial had not been rigorously observed in so far as the dissolution of batasuna had been based inter alia on the conduct attributed to certain zaldibia and legazpia municipal councillors who had made an alleged member of eta and an eta member who had been convicted and had served his sentence honorary citizens hijo predilecto facts which had been established ex parte after completion of the phase of the proceedings during which new evidence could be introduced and without the applicant parties having been able to defend themselves against such allegations they complained thirdly of a violation of the presumption of innocence submitting that the facts deemed to have been proven in the judgment of the supreme court had been based on a single press release and that batasuna and its members had been deemed to have carried out acts attributable to another political organisation namely eh moreover they criticised the judgment of march for having considered as established fact that batasuna had been created on the basis of an agreement between the leaders of herri batasuna and eta and that herri batasuna eh and batasuna were in fact one and the same organisation which had been assigned certain functions by eta and which acted under the instructions of the latter while those allegations had actually been based on documents having no probative value and on the statements of expert witnesses working for the spanish government fourthly and lastly the applicant parties considered that their right to freedom of expression thought and association had been breached as a result of their dissolution by two unanimous judgments of january the dismissed the appeals in the judgment on batasuna s amparo appeal the constitutional court repeated the arguments contradicting the applicant parties submissions concerning militant democracy set out in its judgment of march it pointed out that any project or objective was constitutional provided that it was not pursued by means of activities which breach ed democratic principles or the fundamental rights of citizens it also pointed out that the constitutionality of section of the lopp ha d been recognised by judgment and that the answers to the objections raised by batasuna as to the constitutionality of the conduct described by the provisions of the law at issue could be found in the legal bases of that law the stated the refusal of a political party to condemn terrorist attacks can be seen in certain cases as ‘ tacit political support for terrorism section a lopp or ‘ legitimising terrorist actions for political ends section a lopp in so far as it may excuse terrorism or minimise the significance thereof the failure to condemn terrorist actions also constitutes a tacit or implicit manifestation of a certain attitude towards terror against a backdrop of terrorism that has been in place for over thirty years with those responsible always legitimising terror by claiming equality between the types of forces fighting each other and by presenting it as the only possible solution to an allegedly historical conflict the refusal of a party to condemn a specific terrorist attack which undeniably reflects that party s wish to disassociate itself from the condemnatory stance taken by other parties in relation to such acts is all the more significant since it reflects the position of a party which has sought to pass off the terrorist phenomenon as an inevitable reaction to the past and unjust aggression of a terrorised state furthermore the refusal to condemn terrorist acts combined with serious and repeated acts and conduct indicates an accommodation with terror which runs counter to organised coexistence in the context of a democratic state it must therefore be concluded that it would not appear to be unreasonable or erroneous to take account of facts judicially established in proceedings having observed all the guarantees covering the grounds for dissolution laid down by the lopp whose unconstitutionality in abstracto was ruled out by constitutional court judgment no thus ruling out any possibility of a breach of article of the constitution and that no substantive fundamental right such as the right of political association articles and of the constitution the right to freedom of conscience article of the constitution and the right to freedom of expression article a of the constitution has been breached. lastly in the reasoning of its judgment the constitutional court pointed out that in its appeal batasuna had literally alleged that the effect of the lopp had been to deprive ideologies linked to terrorism and violence of any possibility of developing lawfully in breach of the procedural definition of democracy and had argued that the law at issue declared unlawful the mere fact of providing political and ideological support to the actions of terrorist organisations with the aim of overthrowing the constitutional order it held that this link with terrorism and violence fell outside the constitutionally legitimate scope of the exercise of freedom of association and freedom of expression and could therefore be prohibited by the democratic legislature as regards herri batasuna s amparo appeal the constitutional court again referred to its judgment of march in which it had indicated that the various causes of dissolution of parties could only be taken into account as of the entry into force of the law stating however that for the purpose of determining the significance of the activities listed by the law and assessing their importance having regard to the overall conduct of the party at issue and for such purposes only since to take account of conduct prior to the entry into force of the law in order to justify a declaration of illegality would have been unconstitutional in that it would have breached the principle of non-retrospectivity enshrined in article of the constitution it was perfectly possible to take into consideration what the law called the ‘ trajectory section of the party at issue which could encompass conduct prior to the entry into force of the law without it being possible in any circumstances to consider that to be a case of retrospective application prohibited by the constitution the constitutional court pointed out that the applicant party had not been dissolved because of acts pre-dating the entry into force of the law or conduct attributable to other parties but because it had been held that batasuna herri batasuna and eh constituted ‘ successive units of a single reality namely a political organisation used as a tool by a terrorist group for unlawful purposes that the successive forms assumed by a single political party had de facto been dissolved and that the dissolution pronounced by the supreme court had been based on subsequent facts stated as being entirely attributable to the applicant party on account of the fact that the supreme court had found the three dissolved parties to be materially identical lastly the supreme court dismissed the complaints of lack of impartiality and failure to comply with the principle of adversarial proceedings as lacking any constitutional basis on june eta ended the ceasefire that it had declared on march since that date several fatal attacks have been carried out in article political parties are the expression of political pluralism they contribute to the formation and expression of the will of the people and are an essential instrument for political participation their creation and the exercise of their activities are free in so far as they respect the constitution and the law their internal structure and their functioning must be democratic. article the right of association is recognised associations which pursue ends or use means legally defined as criminal offences are illegal associations set up on the basis of this section must be entered in a register for the sole purpose of public knowledge associations may only be dissolved or

the case originated in an application no against the republic of hungary lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a hungarian national mr gábor vona the applicant on june the applicant was represented by mr t. gaudi-nagy a lawyer practising in budapest the hungarian government the government were represented by mr z. tallódi agent ministry of public administration and justice the applicant alleged under article of the convention that the dissolution of the hungarian guard association which he chaired had violated his freedom of association on march the government were given notice of the application it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article of the convention on june the president of the section granted the european roma rights centre leave under article of the convention and rule of the rules of court to intervene as a third party in the proceedings the applicant was born in and lives in budapest on may the hungarian guard association magyar gárda egyesület the association was founded by ten members of the political party movement for a better hungary jobbik magyarországért mozgalom with the stated aim of inter alia preserving hungarian traditions and culture in its turn on july the association founded the hungarian guard movement magyar gárda mozgalom the movement the bureau of the association stated that it had decided to create the hungarian guard first operating it as a movement but later attempting to integrate it into the association as a section it was also decided that in order to integrate the hungarian guard into the association the latter s current charter need ed to be amended by october the movement s objective was defined as defending a physically spiritually and intellectually defenceless hungary the tasks undertaken by the movement as listed in its deed of foundation included the physical and psychological training of its members participation in disaster management and in ensuring public safety as well as the initiation of a social dialogue regarding these issues through public events on october the budapest public prosecutor s office addressed a notice to the association calling on it to terminate its unlawful activities it was noted that the association had carried out activities that were not in accordance with its aims as defined in its charter in particular it was observed that on august it had organised the swearing-in of fifty-six guardsmen in buda castle subsequently the association had conducted a national campaign aimed at popularising tasks defined for the movement which were not in accordance with the aims of the association it was noted that certain aims of the movement were not amongst those defined for the association nor were they in conformity with the association s cultural and tradition-preserving nature on november the applicant as chairman of the association notified the public prosecutor s office that the unlawful activities had been terminated by deleting the impugned part from the movement s deed of foundation and that he had initiated the amendment of the association s charter accordingly on december the general assembly of the association had decided to add the following provision to paragraph of its charter f in accordance with its name the hungarian guard association has the aim of engaging in dialogue with society and of holding public events and gatherings for citizens on issues affecting their security such as disaster management national defence and life-saving techniques. purportedly in pursuit of these goals members of the movement dressed in uniform subsequently held rallies and demonstrations throughout hungary including in villages with large roma populations and called for the defence of ethnic hungarians against so-called gypsy criminality these demonstrations and rallies were not prohibited by the authorities one of these demonstrations involving some activists was organised in tatárszentgyörgy a village of around inhabitants on december the police were present and did not allow the march to pass through a street inhabited by roma families in reaction to this event on december the budapest chief prosecutor s office lodged a court action seeking the dissolution of the association the action was based on the association s alleged abuse of the right to freedom of assembly and the fact that it had conducted activities which infringed the rights of the roma by generating fear among them through speeches and appearance that is to say by the activists wearing uniforms marching in formation and issuing military-style commands the chief prosecutor s office was of the view that the movement constituted a division of the association and that its activity in fact represented a significant part of the latter s activities it argued that the movement was not a spontaneous community in that its members were all registered and stressed that it had been created by the presidency of the association that applications for membership were assessed by the association and that its uniform could be bought from the association in the ensuing proceedings the association claimed however that there were no organisational ties between itself and the movement of a kind amounting to a unity of the two accordingly it argued that it bore no responsibility for the movement it also stated that in any event the movement s activities did not present any objective danger to anyone according to the association a subjective feeling of fear could not give rise to any limitation on fundamental rights including freedom of assembly the movement s conduct had not been intimidating if regarded objectively after holding four hearings the budapest regional court ruled in favour of the chief prosecutor s office on december and disbanded the association under section d of act no ii of on the right to freedom of association see paragraph below the court did not accept the arguments concerning the distinction between the two entities and held that a symbiotic relationship existed between them it held that the principal activity of the association had been the founding operation guidance and financing of the movement observing inter alia that the movement received donations through the association s bank account the legal effect of the judgment was nevertheless limited to the dissolution of the association since in the court s view the movement did not have any legal personality the judgment did not directly extend to it as regards the assembly in tatárszentgyörgy the regional court held as follows the essential purpose of the event was indeed to place the spotlight on ‘ gypsy criminality the use of this generalisation clearly based on racial and ethnic grounds violated the principle of equal human dignity moreover this was not a one-off occasion the movement based its programme on discrimination between people and expressed it by way of marches in several cases this amounted to a demonstration of power and to threatening others through the appearance of the participants in the marches the court is of the opinion that from a constitutional point of view to raise fear virtually as a mission is unacceptable as an aim or role. the court noted that the participants who were uniformed had worn armbands quite similar to those of officers of the arrow cross responsible for the reign of terror in hungary in it took the view that marches with participants dressed in this way were objectively capable of wounding historical sensitivities the court went on to declare that despite the association s stated purpose its actions had violated hungary s laws on associations and created an atmosphere of anti-roma sentiment according to the court the verbal and visual demonstration of power alone amounted to an infringement of the law in the light of historical experience thus for the association to be dissolved it was not necessary for it to have committed an actual offence the fact that its programme encompassed discrimination amounted to prejudicing the rights of others within the meaning of section of act no ii of see paragraph below on july the budapest court of appeal upheld the judgment of the regional court it also considered two further similar demonstrations staged by the movement in the village of fadd on june and in the village of sárbogárd on an unspecified date the court of appeal noted that the speeches given by movement members in the course of the fadd rally had contained numerous remarks aimed at the exclusion of roma as to the sárbogárd event the court of appeal observed that there had been several anti-semitic utterances this court established a closer connection between the two entities extending the scope of its judgment also to the movement it held that the association in fact included the movement as a unit consequently the judgment concerned both of them the association s dissolution also dismantled the organisational framework of individuals operating within any movements related to the dissolved association the court ruled that the choice of locations for the demonstrations that is villages with large roma populations could not be seen as social dialogue but as an extreme form of expression in the context of a quasimilitary demonstration of force consisting of the cumulative effects of military-style uniforms formations commands and salutes the court of appeal while it upheld in essence the arguments of the regional court argued that the population of the villages had been subjected as a captive audience to these extreme and exclusionist views without being able to avoid receiving them in the court s view the events organised by the movement constituted a risk of violence generated conflict breached public order and peace and violated the right to liberty and security of the inhabitants of the villages despite the fact that all the demonstrations which were tightly controlled by the police had finished without any acts of actual violence the court also considered the applicant s freedom of expression it stated upholding the arguments of the first-instance judgment and citing the case-law of the court that this freedom did not cover hate speech or incitement to violence on december the supreme court upheld the judgment of the budapest court of appeal it endorsed the court of appeal s finding that the movement was in fact an entity within the association it also agreed with the lower courts as to the necessity of disbanding the association pointing out that the movement s rallies had caused situations of conflict whose protagonists might potentially have had recourse to violence this decision was served on january the constitution as in force at the material time contained the following provisions the activities of social organisations government bodies or individual citizens may not be directed at the forcible acquisition or exercise of public power or at the exclusive possession of such power everyone has the right and obligation to resist such activities in such ways as are permitted by law. in the republic of hungary every person has the right on the basis of the right of association to establish organisations whose goals are not prohibited by law and to join such organisations the establishment of armed organisations with political objectives shall not be permitted on the basis of the right of association a majority of two-thirds of the votes of the members of parliament present is required to pass the law on the right of assembly and the financial management and operation of political parties. act no ii of on the right to freedom of association provides as follows by virtue of the right of association private individuals legal persons and their entities which have no legal personality may subject to the aims of their activities and the intention of their founders form and operate civil society organisations the exercise of the right of association may not violate article of the constitution nor may it constitute a criminal offence or incitement to a criminal offence and may not prejudice the rights and liberties of others. a civil society organisation is a voluntarily established self-governing organisation formed for a purpose stated in its articles of association which has registered members and organises its members activities in order to further its purpose unregistered members may also participate in large-scale public events. a civil society organisation comes into existence by means of registration with the courts. a community of private individuals formed by virtue of the right of association whose operation is not regular or which has no registered members or structure specified under this act shall not constitute a civil society organisation. upon an action brought by the public prosecutor the court the legal status of associations can be briefly characterised as follows associations whose activities do not serve a public interest can not be supported by individuals by means of income-tax-deductible donations and are not entitled to receive other donations or to apply for public subsidies as these privileges are reserved for public-benefit organisations under the provisions of acts nos cxxvi of and clxxv of however act no lxxxi of provides that income deriving from the non-profit activities of any association is exempt from corporate tax and that the associations business activities are subject to preferential corporate taxation in addition under act no cxvii of advantageous incometax rules apply to certain services provided by associations and certain remunerations and social welfare benefits received from them furthermore act no iv of on the civil code provides that the members of an association are not liable for the association s debts act no lxxvii of on the rights of national and ethnic minorities as in force at the material time provided as follows the republic of hungary prohibits all policies or conducts which a are aimed at or result in a minority s assimilation into or exclusion or segregation from the majority nation b aim to change the national or ethnic composition of areas populated by minorities c persecute impair the lives of or hamper the exercise of the rights of a minority or persons belonging to a minority on account of their belonging to a minority law-decree no of promulgating the international covenant on civil and political rights adopted by the general assembly of the united nations at its session on december provides as follows any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. law-decree no of promulgating the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination adopted in new york on december provides as follows in this convention the term ‘ racial discrimination shall mean any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life states parties condemn racial discrimination and undertake to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and promoting understanding among all races and to this end d each state party shall prohibit and bring to an end by all appropriate means including legislation as required by circumstances racial discrimination by any persons group or organization states parties condemn all propaganda and all organizations which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form and undertake to a declare an offence punishable by law all incitement to racial discrimination and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities including the financing thereof b declare illegal and prohibit organizations and also organized and all other propaganda activities which promote and incite racial discrimination and shall recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law decision no ab of the constitutional court contains the following passages ii the criminal codes of all democratic european countries with continental legal systems as well as those of england and wales canada and new zealand which have the anglo-saxon legal system prohibit incitement on a ‘ racial basis the demarcation of the boundary between incitement arousal of hatred and expression of opinion remains hotly contested even internationally the potential harms resulting from incitement to hate and from humiliating expressions of contempt for certain groups in a population are amply documented in the annals of human experience the tragic historical experiences of our century prove that views preaching racial ethnic national or religious inferiority or superiority and the dissemination of ideas of hatred contempt and exclusion endanger the values of human civilization it is proved both by history and by the events of our times that any utterance expressing an intention to arouse hatred against a specific group of people can push social tension to extremes disturb social harmony and peace and in an extreme case can result in violent clashes between certain groups of society in addition to the historical and contemporary experiences proving the extremely damaging effects of arousing hatred it is necessary to consider the everyday threats that result from the unlimited expression of ideas and concepts liable to arouse hatred such expression prevents human communities from living in harmony with other groups by intensifying emotional and social tensions within a smaller or bigger community this can destroy ties within the society reinforce extreme positions and increase prejudice and intolerance all this results in a diminution of the chances of creating a tolerant and multicultural society which acknowledges pluralism the right to be different and the equal dignity of all people and in which discrimination is not regarded as a value to afford constitutional protection to the incitement of hatred against certain groups under the guise of freedom of expression and of the press would present an irresolvable contradiction with the value system and political orientation expressed in the constitution that is with the democratic rule of law the equality of human beings equal dignity the prohibition of discrimination freedom of religion and conscience and the protection of national and ethnic minorities as recognised by the various articles of the constitution incitement to hatred is a negation of the above-mentioned notions an emotional preparation for the use of violence it is an abuse of freedom of expression being an intolerant classification of a group characteristic of dictatorships rather than democracies to tolerate the exercise of freedom of expression and of the press in a manner prohibited by article of the criminal code would contradict the requirements flowing from the democratic rule of law as a summary of its position the constitutional court points out that the restriction of freedom of expression and of the press is necessitated and justified by the negative historical experiences surrounding the arousal of hatred against certain groups of people by the protection of constitutional values and by the obligation of the republic of hungary to comply with its commitments under international law decision no ab of the constitutional court contains the following passages the freedom to express one s opinion is not only a subjective right but also a guarantee of the free expression of various views shaping public opinion although this right can be restricted it enjoys special protection due to its primary role and thus may be restricted only in relation to a few other rights therefore secondary theoretical values such as public peace enjoy less protection than the right concerned like the right to life the right to human dignity is eminently protected in the constitution the constitution is not value-neutral but has its own set of values expressing opinions inconsistent with constitutional values is not protected by article of the constitution the constitutional court points out that also under the convention freedom of expression carries with it ‘ duties and responsibilities all state authorities are obliged to protect the values of a democratic state under the rule of law and to respect the dignity of persons action must be taken against conduct representing force hatred and conflict rejecting the use or threat of force as a means of solving conflicts is part of the complex concept of democracy. decision no ab of the constitutional court contains the following passage iii even in the case of extreme opinions it is not the content of the opinion but the direct and foreseeable consequences of its communication that justify a restriction on free expression and the application of legal measures under civil or in some cases criminal law. decision no ab of the constitutional court contains the following passages iii the aim of the amendment to the criminal code is to punish hate speech and gestures even if the injured party can not be identified as a result however the amendment would punish not only conduct violating the honour and dignity of particular persons but all forms of hate speech including racist statements containing generalisations meaning that the ‘ affected parties or the parties that consider themselves to be ‘ affected are not forced to take part in or follow the exchange of communication between persons expressing hatred or to face hate thoughts in certain media outlets extremist voices are not suppressed in constitutional democracies simply on account of their content in a democratic society such generalising racist speech can not change the fact that from the state s perspective each citizen is equally valuable and has the same basic rights in its present form the amendment would also punish speeches containing only such generalisations participation in the communication by persons belonging to the group being attacked that is their listening to or being exposed in any way to the racist statements is not a statutory element of the offence as defined in the amendment however these are precisely the cases in which the expression of an opinion may offend not only the sensitivity or sense of dignity of certain persons but also their constitutional rights for example if a perpetrator expresses his extremist political convictions in such a manner that a person belonging to the injured group is forced to listen to the communication in a state of intimidation and is not in a position to avoid it ‘ captive audience in this case the right of the person concerned not to listen to or become aware of the distasteful or injurious opinion deserves protection persons belong not only to the community of citizens but also to a narrower group or community an individual can also by virtue of belonging to such a group be exposed to an injury of such gravity and intensity that recourse to criminal-law sanctions may even be warranted to redress the issue. the concluding observations of the united nations human rights committee in respect of hungary adopted in geneva october contain the following passage the committee is concerned at the virulent and widespread anti-roma statements by members of the disbanded magyar gárda furthermore it is concerned at indications of rising anti-semitism in the state party the committee is concerned at the constitutional court s restrictive interpretation of article of the penal code on incitement to violence which may be incompatible with the state party s obligations under article the fourth report of the european commission against racism and intolerance on hungary adopted on june contains the following passages t here has been a disturbing increase in racism and intolerance in public discourse in hungary in particular the creation and rise of the radical right-wing hungarian guard magyar gárda is consistently cited as a cause for deep concern since its creation in august and the public swearing in of several hundred new members in october the hungarian guard has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country including in villages with large roma populations despite apparently innocuous articles of association amongst the group s chief messages is the defence of ethnic hungarians against so-called ‘ gipsy crime ‘ members of the hungarian guard parade in matching paramilitary-style black boots and uniforms with insignia and flags closely resembling the flag of the arrow cross party an openly nazi organisation that briefly held power in hungary during world war ii and during whose spell in power tens of thousands of jews and roma were killed or deported groups such as the hungarian guard also openly express antisemitic views the expression of antisemitic views is currently on the rise in hungary. the third opinion on hungary of the advisory committee of the framework convention for the protection of national minorities adopted on march contains the following passage since its creation in the hungarian guard magyar gárda has organised numerous public rallies throughout the country including in villages with large roma populations during which members of the hungarian guard parade in matching paramilitary-style black boots and uniforms with nazi insignia and flags the advisory committee is concerned by this threatening behaviour the german federal constitutional court held in its stoppt den synagogenbau judgment of june bverfge inhaltsbezogenes versammlungsverbot that to avert danger to public order it was possible to restrict freedom of assembly if it was the art und weise that is the manner or means by which an assembly was conducted and not the content which gave rise to concerns accordingly it was permissible to restrict aggressive and provocative conduct by participants which intimidates citizens and through which demonstrators create a climate of violent demonstration and potential readiness for violence with regard to an extreme right-wing march staged on holocaust memorial day it held in addition that the manner or means by which an assembly is conducted may give rise to provocation which significantly encroaches upon moral sensitivities sittliches empfinden regarding the way in which the assembly was conducted the federal constitutional court also attached importance to the provocative behaviour of the protestors it added that the same applied when a procession on account of its overall character durch sein gesamtgepräge identifies with the rites and symbols of the nazi tyranny and intimidates other citizens by evoking the horrors of the past totalitarian and inhumane regime in the context of the dissolution of an association the german federal administrative court in judgment bverwg a of august summarised its case-law on the banning of associations as follows whether or not the purpose and activity of an association are punishable under criminal law will depend on the intentions and conduct of its members an association as such can not be criminally liable only natural persons are punishable under criminal law because criminality implies a capacity for criminal responsibility schuldzurechnungsfähigkeit which only natural persons possess as is clear from section of the association act vereinsg it is nevertheless legally possible for an association to be criminally liable strafgesetzwidrigkeit einer vereinigung because the association can form through its members and through its representing organs a collective will which is detached from the individual members and which develops its own purpose zweckrichtung and can act independently if the criminal law is breached as a result of this own purpose or of the independent actions of an association all the conditions for applying the prohibition verbotstatbestand are fulfilled a decisive factor in this context is that the members conduct can be attributed to the association the character of the association must be shaped prägen by the criminal offences strafgesetzwidrigkeit committed by its members an association can strive concurrently for different aims besides the legal aim laid down in its rules it can also pursue criminal aims which it achieves through the conduct of its members the prohibition of an association based on section first sentence first alternative of the associations act read in conjunction with the first alternative of article of the basic law is de iure independent of the criminal conviction of a member or an official of the association it is within the competency of the authority issuing the prohibition order and the administrative court to examine whether there has been a breach of criminal law gesetzeswidrigkeit however it is not the purpose of the prohibition verbotstatbestand to impose an additional sanction on individuals who have already violated criminal provisions rather the purpose of the provision is to deal with a particular threat to public safety and public order expressed in the founding or continuing existence of an organisation which is planning or committing criminal acts such organisations constitute a particular threat to interests rechtsgüter protected by the criminal law the organisation s inherent momentum and its organised human and material resources facilitate and promote punishable acts at the same time the sense of responsibility of each member is often reduced individual resistance to committing a criminal act is lessened and the impetus to commit further criminal acts is created judgment of october op cit. p. and pp respectively löwer in v. münch/kunig gg vol ed note ad article the german federal administrative court has repeatedly upheld dissolution orders in respect of associations which supported neo- nazi ideas in its heimattreue deutsche jugend judgment of september bverwg a in which members of the association were propagating nazi racial treatises and ideas the federal administrative court reiterated its relevant case-law stating that in order to satisfy the conditions of the ban the association must have intended to realise its anti-constitutional aims in a militant or aggressive way a condition which did not require the use of force or a specific violation of the law it was sufficient for the finding of an unconstitutional aim that justified the ban for the programme imagery and style to indicate an essential relationship with nazism the fact that an association aligned itself with the nazi party prohibited in germany or propagated a racial theory which was not in conformity with the constitutional prohibition of discrimination was sufficient to meet the conditions for banning the association if an association attempted to hide its unconstitutional intentions the conditions for the ban would become clear simply from the general picture formed by the individual statements and conduct the fact that these elements might appear to be subordinate to a varying number of innocuous circumstances said nothing in itself about their significance the supreme court of the united states considered the problem of intimidation in virginia v. black us a virginia statute makes it a felony for any person with the intent of intimidating any person or group to burn a cross on the property of another a highway or other public place and specifies that a ny such burning shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group. the supreme court held that burning a cross in the united states was inextricably intertwined with the history of the ku klux klan the klan had often used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending violence to this day regardless of whether the message was a political one or was also meant to intimidate the burning of a cross was a symbol of hate. while cross burning did not inevitably convey a message of intimidation often the cross burner intended that the recipients of the message should fear for their lives the first amendment of the constitution of the united states permitted a state to ban true threats which encompassed those statements where the speaker meant to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals the speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat rather a prohibition on true threats protected individuals from the fear of violence and the disruption that fear engendered as well as from the possibility that the threatened violence would occur intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word was a type of true threat where a speaker directed a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death the first amendment permitted virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross was a particularly virulent form of intimidation,case originated application republic hungary lodged court article convention protection human rights

agreement on their behalf the substitute agreement proposed to the applicant included these terms parties the applicant and hrf term of validity from july up to and december thereafter for one year at a time unlessnotice is given two months prior to the expiry of the agreement as from the above date the most recent agreement between the employers association and hrf shall be applied between the applicant and hrf should the employers association and hrf subsequently reach a new agreement or agree to amendor supplement the present agreement the new agreement amendments or supplements shall automatically apply as fromthe day on which it or they has or have been agreed upon the employer shall on his employees behalf subscribeto and maintain five different insurance-policy schemes

union or bysigning a substitute agreement had the applicant accepted a substitute agreement it would have applied not only to those of his employees who were unionised but also to those who were not in the summer of one member of hrf was employed by the applicant in he employed another member of that union and also two persons who were respectively members of the commercial employees union handelsanställdas förbund and the union of municipal workers kommunalarbetareförbundet in one member of the latter union was employed by the applicant following the applicant s refusal to sign a substitute agreement hrf in july placed his restaurant under a blockade and declared a boycott against it sympathy industrial action was taken the same month by the commercial employees union and the swedish food workers union svenska livsmedelsarbetareförbundet in the summer of sympathy action was also taken by the swedish transport workers union svenska transportarbetareförbundet and the union of municipal employees kommunaltjenestemannaförbundet as a result deliveries to the restaurant were stopped one of the persons employed by the applicant at ihre baden who was member of hrf had publicly expressed the opinion that the industrial action was unnecessary as the salary and working conditions in the restaurant were not open to criticism according to the government the union action had its background in a request for assistance in by an hrf member employed by the applicant in the view of the union the applicant paid his employees approximately swedish kronor sek a month less than what they would have received under a collective agreement he did not pay his staff holiday compensation as provided for in the annual leave act semesterlagen nor salary during lay-offs due to poor weather conditions as required by the employment protection act and he did not sign a labour-market insurance until in august the applicant invoking the convention requested the government to prohibit hrf from continuing the blockade and the other trade unions from continuing their sympathy action and to order the unions to pay compensation for damages in the alternative he requested that compensation be paid by the state by a decision of january the government ministry of justice dismissed the applicant s request the government stated the requests for a prohibition of the blockade and thesympathy action as well as compensation for damage from thetrade unions concern a legal dispute between private subjects.according to chapter article of the instrument of government regeringsformen which forms part of theconstitution such disputes may not be determined by anypublic authority other than a court of law except by virtueof law there is no provision in the law which authorises thegovernment to examine such disputes the government will not therefore examine these requests on the merits the claim for damages is dismissed the applicant applied to the regeringsrätten for review under the act on judicial review of certain administrative decisions lag om rättsprövning av vissa förvaltningsbeslut the act on june the dismissed the application on the ground that the government s decision did not concern an administrative matter involving the exercise of public power which was a condition for review under section of the act on september the swedish touring club svenska turistföreningen stf a non-profit-making association promoting tourism in sweden terminated the membership of the applicant s youth hostel referring to a lack of cooperation and the applicant s negative attitude towards stf as a result the hostel was no longer mentioned in stf s catalogue of youth hostels in in about half of the youth hostels in were enrolled in stf the applicant brought proceedings in the district court tingsrätten of he contested what he considered to be his personal exclusion from stf alleging that it had been caused by hrf threats that it would take industrial action against other youth hostels enrolled in stf if his hostel was not excluded he also challenged stf s termination of the membership of his youth hostel stf accepted inter alia that although the termination of the membership contract concerning the applicant s youth hostel had not been prompted by the conflict between the applicant and the trade unions this conflict might have affected the timing of the decision stf also referred to an opinion of the competition ombudsman ombudsmannen för näringsfrihet of november to the effect that the termination of the contract in question would have only a very limited impact on his business by a judgment of may the district court rejected the applicant s action on both points it found inter alia that the applicant had not shown that he had been personally excluded from stf by virtue of the termination of stf s contract concerning his youth hostel it also found that he had not shown that the contract had been financially significant to his business reference was made to the competition ombudsman s finding the applicant appealed to the svea court of appeal svea hovrätt which on march upheld the district court s judgment the court of appeal found inter alia that stf s termination of the contract concerning the youth hostel had entailed the expiry of the applicant s personal membership of stf this however had not been tantamount to his exclusion given that he could have continued or renewed his membership moreover although the contract had been of appreciable significance to the applicant s business stf s termination of the contract could not be considered unreasonable at the beginning of the applicant sold his restaurant due to his difficulties in running his business which had allegedly been caused by the industrial action the restaurant was bought by a person who signed a collective agreement with hrf he continued together with his family to run the youth hostel in lummelunda following the above the union action

the case originated in an application no against the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the national union of rail maritime and transport workers rmt the applicant union on june the applicant union was represented before the court by its general secretary mr b crow its legal representative was mr n. todd of thompsons solicitors manchester it was advised by mr j. hendy qc and mr m. ford qc barristers in london the united kingdom government the government were represented by their agent ms r. tomlinson foreign and commonwealth office a joint submission was received from the european trade union confederation etuc and the trades union congress tuc a submission was also received from liberty these three organisations were given leave by the president to intervene as third parties in the written procedure article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the government replied to the submission of liberty the applicant union alleged that its ability to protect its members interests was subject to excessive statutory restriction in violation of its right to freedom of association on august notice of the application was given to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article of the convention the applicant is a trade union based in london with a membership of more than persons employed in different sectors of the transport industry in the united kingdom noting that in the domestic system industrial disputes are governed by very detailed legislative provisions the applicant union raised two specific limitations on the statutory protection of strike action that it submitted were inconsistent with article of the convention each of the contested limitations being exposed by a separate set of facts the relevant set of facts relied on under this head involved the company edf energy powerlink ltd. edf which was under contract to manage operate and maintain the electrical power network used by london s underground transport system the rmt was one of several trade unions recognised by the company for the purposes of collective bargaining in all the company employed some staff at three different sites the biggest one being that at tufnell park with employees according to the applicant union there were rmt members there at the relevant time the company would not have known which of its employees were members of a trade union as it did not operate a system for deducting union subscriptions from staff wages between june and september the applicant union and the company held several rounds of negotiation on pay and conditions of service dissatisfied with the company s offer it decided to embark on industrial action and on september gave the requisite ballot notice to the company see paragraph below the notice described the category of workers that would be voting on industrial action as engineer/technician and stated how many of such were based at each site the following day the company wrote to the applicant union stating that it did not recognise the term technician it categorised its workers in a more precise way fitters jointers test-room inspectors day testers shift testers olbi fitters it considered the ballot notice served on it was therefore not compliant with the relevant statutory provisions the applicant union replied the following week maintaining that the term it had used was sufficient to allow the company to know which employees were concerned thereby meeting the purpose of the relevant provisions of law following a further exchange of correspondence between the two sides the company applied to the high court for an injunction to restrain the applicant union from calling industrial action on the basis of the ballot the injunction was granted by blake j on october the judge did not accept the applicant union s claim that the statutory requirements unduly restricted the exercise of its right to call industrial action this same argument having been rejected by the court of appeal in the case of metrobus ltd v. unite the union ewca civ he also rejected the argument that since the procedure was still at an early stage it would be premature to put a stop to it instead he considered the risk of unlawful strike action to be sufficiently imminent to justify the injunction given the sector involved the implications of a shutdown would be substantial with widespread ramifications elsewhere addressing the question whether the applicant union had in fact given sufficient indication of the category of staff that would be balloted the judge found that it had not since the union s members at tufnell park included persons working at different trades the applicant union was not under an absolute duty but instead a duty to do its reasonable best to provide sufficient information to the company the fact that it used its own system of job classification was relevant but not decisive similarly the fact that a union might not record or possess such information could be a highly material consideration but not necessarily a decisive one the applicant union had accepted that it was practicable for a union to supply the necessary information in the context of a small place of employment it was therefore neither onerous nor unreasonable to require it to do so finally the judge observed that while there was as yet no stated intention on the part of the applicant union to call a strike the ballot not having taken place there was a clear nexus between the failure to provide the requisite notice and the employer s ability to respond to the situation either by making preparations for a work stoppage or seeking to persuade employees not to vote for industrial action the applicant union s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was therefore not a mere technical or immaterial breach application for permission to appeal was refused on the papers on november renewed application for permission to appeal was refused on january by which point the industrial dispute between the applicant union and edf had already been resolved following the granting of the injunction against the strike the applicant union set about gathering the precise job descriptions of the workers concerned and included these in a fresh notice of a strike ballot the result of which supported industrial action this went ahead on dates in december and early january edf made an improved offer on january which was accepted by the union s members and took effect as a collective agreement on april of the same year the set of facts relied on under this head involved some rmt members who were employed in railway maintenance by fastline limited a company that formed part of a group of companies known as jarvis plc another company in the group jarvis rail limited was engaged in rail engineering work at the time fastline and jarvis rail limited jarvis employed approximately persons in total of whom were members of the rmt in august fastline transferred part of its undertaking comprising twenty employees to another company known as hydrex equipment uk ltd hydrex these employees existing terms and conditions were preserved by hydrex as required by law transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations according to the applicant union the employees involved were nonetheless concerned for their situation as hydrex workers were paid significantly less it also appeared that trade unions had less influence in that company in march hydrex s management informed the ex-jarvis employees that because of difficult market conditions it intended to reduce the level of their terms and conditions to that of other hydrex staff this meant a reduction in salary of some according to the applicant union in the months that followed the applicant union made representations to hydrex on behalf of the employees concerned but without achieving any agreement when the company indicated that it intended to proceed with its plan the applicant union organised a strike ballot of the workers concerned seventeen by that stage they voted in favour of a strike which took place between november and november during the strike the participants organised pickets at a number of the sites where they normally carried out their work this caused hydrex to write to the applicant union to remind it that by law picketing could take place only at or near the employer s premises and to warn that the union was exposing itself to liability for any economic loss incurred by the company due to this unlawful action see paragraph below a second strike was announced for november but this was postponed when hydrex indicated its willingness to resume discussions with the applicant union this led to a revised offer which the union submitted to its hydrex members recommending that they accept it the result of the vote was known on december nine votes were cast all of them rejecting the hydrex offer according to the applicant union its position was extremely weak given the very small number of its members in the hydrex workforce these were far too few for their strike action to have any appreciable effect on the company whose activities had not really been disrupted at all the applicant union considered that it would have been in a position to defend its members interests much more effectively had it been able to mobilise its jarvis members as well the simple threat of a strike on this scale and a fortiori an actual stoppage would have exerted significantly more pressure on hydrex to maintain existing terms and conditions the applicant union stated that jarvis employees would have been willing to strike in support of their colleagues at hydrex instead the hydrex members had had to stand alone and in the end had no option but to accept the new terms and conditions they did so under protest according to the applicant union neither jarvis nor hydrex exist any longer having been put into administration in march and november respectively the hydrex undertaking was purchased by another company which in turn sold it on in november in relation to the edf case blake j referred to the following provisions of the trade union and labour relations consolidation act the act section an act done by a trade union to induce a person to take part or continue to take part in industrial action a is not protected unless the industrial action has the support of a ballot and b where section falls to be complied with in relation to the person s employer is not protected as respects the employer unless the trade union has complied with section in relation to him. section the trade union must take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that— a not later than the seventh day before the opening day of the ballot the notice specified in subsection is received by every person who it is reasonable for the union to believe at the latest time when steps could be taken to comply with paragraph a will be the employer of persons who will be entitled to vote in the ballot the notice referred to in paragraph a of subsection is a notice in writing— a stating that the union intends to hold the ballot b specifying the date which the union reasonably believes will be the opening day of the ballot and c containing— i the lists mentioned in subsection and the figures mentioned in subsection together with an explanation of how those figures were arrived at or the lists are— a a list of the categories of employee to which the employees concerned belong and b a list of the workplaces at which the employees concerned work the figures are— a the total number of employees concerned b the number of the employees concerned in each of the categories in the list mentioned in subsection a and c the number of the employees concerned who work at each workplace in the list mentioned in subsection b the lists and figures supplied under this section or the information mentioned in subsection that is so supplied must be as accurate as is reasonably practicable in the light of the information in the possession of the union at the time when it complies with subsection a in relation to the hydrex situation the statutory protection against liability in tort regarding acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute section of the act is confined by section of the same act to a dispute between workers and their employer secondary action is expressly excluded from statutory protection by section of the act which defines it as follows there is secondary action in relation to a trade dispute when and only when a person— a induces another to break a contract of employment or interferes or induces another to interfere with its performance or b threatens that a contract of employment under which he or another is employed will be broken or its performance interfered with or that he will induce another to break a contract of employment or to interfere with its performance and the employer under the contract of employment is not the employer party to the dispute. the provisions on peaceful picketing are contained in section of the act which provides it is lawful for a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute to attend— a at or near his own place of work or b if he is an official of a trade union at or near the place of work of a member of the union whom he is accompanying and whom he represents for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information or peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working if a person works or normally works— a otherwise than at any one place or b at a place the location of which is such that attendance there for a purpose mentioned in subsection is impracticable his place of work for the purposes of that subsection shall be any premises of his employer from which he works or from which his work is administered. both parties referred to the previous legislative regime which included secondary action in the scope of the statutory protection the government explained that secondary action was first outlawed by the trade disputes and trade unions act adopted in the aftermath of the general strike of the situation changed with the trade disputes and trade unions act which lifted the ban further reforms occurred in the the trade union and labour relations act afforded substantially broader protection to industrial action than is the case at present it provided at section as amended in an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort on the ground only— a that it induces another person to break a contract or interferes or induces any other person to interfere with its performance or b that it consists in his threatening that a contract whether one to which he is a party or not will be broken or its performance interfered with or that he will induce another person to break a contract or to interfere with its performance. this provision was considered by the house of lords in the case of express newspapers ltd v. mcshane and another ac the case involved secondary action in the newspaper industry led by the national union of journalists the majority of the house held that the test to be applied to determine whether an act enjoyed the protection of section was a subjective one that is to say it was sufficient that the person honestly believed that the act in question might further the cause of those taking part in the dispute the genuineness of such belief could be tested by the courts but the person calling the strike did not need to prove that it was reasonably capable of achieving the objective lord wilberforce dissented on the nature of the test but concurred with the finding that the injunction granted against the union should be discharged although the applicant union maintained that the mcshane judgment was not a significant development in the law in that it merely confirmed the interpretation of clear statutory language the case was referred to during the parliamentary debates leading to the passage of the employment act as one of the reasons for introducing restrictions on secondary action in section of that act the act retained immunity for secondary action provided that three conditions were satisfied i that it was taken against first suppliers or customers of the employer in dispute or against associated employers of the employer which were substituting for it during the dispute ii that its principal purpose was to directly prevent or disrupt the supply of goods or services between the employer in dispute and his supplier or customer during the dispute and iii that it was likely to achieve that purpose the current rule was originally introduced by the employment act and then re-enacted in the act in the terms set out above the parties provided statistical information on the number of days lost to industrial action in the united kingdom going back to the the government pointed out that in that decade the average number of days lost each year was million this decreased in the to an average of million days from the early to the present day the figure is much lower standing at days lost per year on average they attributed part of this decline at least to the ban on secondary action the applicant union disputed that interpretation it noted that the available statistics did not distinguish between primary and secondary strikes it was therefore impossible to identify the true extent of secondary action before and consequently impossible to ascertain the impact of the restrictions introduced in and in the applicant union s view secondary action had been relatively rare the overwhelming majority of strikes at that time had been primary strikes it referred to official figures contained in a government publication the employment gazette indicating that since the the united kingdom was consistently close to the european average for days lost to industrial action according to this source the country had been middle-ranking since the end of the the only exception was for on account of the long and widespread strike in the mining industry that year the government submitted that the comparative statistics needed to be interpreted with caution given the profound transformation of europe over the past twenty years the fact that the united kingdom remained close to the european average in this regard indicated that contrary to the applicant union s point of view the rules on industrial action were not so restrictive as to make it excessively difficult to organise strikes in support of its application the applicant union included references to other international legal instruments and the interpretation given to them by the competent organs the most relevant and detailed of these materials are referred to below while there is no provision in the conventions adopted by the international labour organization ilo expressly conferring a right to strike both the committee on freedom of association and the committee of experts on the application of conventions and recommendations the committee of experts have progressively developed a number of principles on the right to strike based on articles and of the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise convention no summarised in giving globalization a human face international labour office this convention was ratified by the united kingdom on june the committee of experts has commented several times upon the notice requirements for industrial action in the united kingdom the applicant union referred to the following statement adopted in in its previous comments the committee had taken note of comments made by the tuc to the effect that the notice requirements for an industrial action to be protected by immunity were unjustifiably burdensome the committee notes that according to the government a number of measures have already been taken to simplify sections of the tulra and of the order moreover as part of a plan published in december to simplify aspects of employment law the government explicitly invited trade unions to come forward with their ideas to simplify trade union law further since then the government has held discussions with the tuc to examine their ideas to simplify aspects of the law on industrial action ballots and notices these discussions are ongoing the committee notes that in its latest comments the tuc notes that there has been no progress in this reform the committee requests the government to indicate in its next report progress made in this regard. more recently in a direct request to the government of the united kingdom the committee of experts stated in its previous comments the committee had taken note of comments made by the trade union congress tuc to the effect that the notice requirements for an industrial action to be protected by immunity were unjustifiably burdensome the committee requested the government to continue to provide information on any developments as well as any relevant statistics or reports on the practical application and effect of these requirements the committee notes the government s indication that the court of appeal decision in rmt v. serco and in aslef v. london midland ewca overturned injunctions which had been obtained by serco and london midland railway against the two main national transport unions the rmt and aslef in both cases the injunctions had been obtained on the basis of the unions breaches of statutory balloting and notification procedures this case was the latest in a series of cases assessing the extent of unions technical obligations to ensure that a fair balloting process had taken place in the rmt v. serco decision the court of appeal issued some key clarification so that in future it is likely to be more difficult for employers to obtain injunctions to prevent strike action as a result of breaches of the balloting and notice requirements a court of appeal decision is binding on all lower courts subsequent to this case in balfour beatty v. unite ewhc qb the court found against balfour beatty taking account of the serco case and the need to strike a balance between striving for democratic legitimacy and imposing unrealistic burdens on unions and their officers the committee notes the tuc s observation that while it greatly welcomes both decisions it considers that they do not fully address the problems arising under the legislation that it has identified and that the legislation continues to impose intolerable demands on trade unions the committee notes these developments with interest and requests the government to provide its comments on the concerns raised by the tuc. the committee of experts has taken the following view see giving globalization a human face with regard to so-called ‘ sympathy strikes the committee considers that a general prohibition of this form of strike action could lead to abuse particularly in the context of globalization characterized by increasing interdependence and the internationalization of production and that workers should be able to take such action provided that the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. the committee on freedom of association also considers this form of industrial action to be protected by international labour law see freedom of association digest of the decisions and principles of the freedom of association committee of the governing body of the ilo fifth revised edition international labour office a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful a ban on strike action not linked to a collective dispute to which the employee or union is a party is contrary to the principles of freedom of association. in its consideration of the united kingdom s observance of convention no the committee of experts has repeatedly criticised the fact that secondary strikes are illegal the initial criticism was included in its observation concerning the united kingdom the committee notes that the common law renders virtually all forms of strikes or other industrial action unlawful as a matter of civil law this means that workers and unions who engage in such action are liable to be sued for damages by employers or other parties who suffer loss as a consequence and more importantly in practical terms may be restrained from committing unlawful acts by means of injunctions issued on both an interlocutory and a permanent basis it appears to the committee that unrestricted access to such remedies would deny workers the right to take strikes or other industrial action in order to protect and to promote their economic and social interests it is most important therefore that workers and unions should have some measure of protection against civil liability there has been legislative recognition of this imperative since in the form of a series of ‘ immunities or more accurately ‘ protections against tort action for trade unions and their members and officials the current version of the ‘ immunities is to be found in the trade union and labour relations act the scope of these protections has been narrowed in a number of respects since the committee notes for example that section of the act has been amended so as to limit the right to picket to a worker s own place of work or in the case of a trade union official the place of work of the relevant membership whilst section of the act removes protection from ‘ secondary action in the sense of action directed against an employer who is not directly a party to a given trade dispute in addition the definition of ‘ trade dispute in section of the act has been narrowed so as to encompass only disputes between workers and their own employer rather than disputes between ‘ employers and workers or ‘ workers and workers as was formerly the case taken together these changes appear to make it virtually impossible for workers and unions lawfully to engage in any form of boycott activity or ‘ sympathetic action against parties not directly involved in a given dispute the committee has never expressed any decided view on the use of boycotts as an exercise of the right to strike however it appears to the committee that where a boycott relates directly to the social and economic interests of the workers involved in either or both of the original dispute and the secondary action and where the original dispute and the secondary action are not unlawful in themselves then that boycott should be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the right to strike this is clearly consistent with the approach the committee has adopted in relation to ‘ sympathy strikes it would appear that more frequent recourse is being had to this form of action i.e sympathy strikes because of the structure or the concentration of industries or the distribution of work centres in different regions of the world the committee considers that a general prohibition of sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful. it appears that the committee of experts did not take a definitive position on the ban until its observation concerning the united kingdom when it observed as follows the committee draws the government s attention to paragraph of its general survey on freedom of association and collective bargaining where it indicates that a general prohibition on sympathy strikes could lead to abuse and that workers should be able to take such action provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful the lifting of immunity opens such industrial action to be actionable in tort and therefore would constitute a serious impediment to the workers right to carry out sympathy strikes. it has maintained this view since stating in its most recent review of the situation observation see report of the committee of experts to the international labour conference session pp immunities in respect of civil liability for strikes and other industrial action sections and of the tulra in its previous comments the committee had noted that according to the tuc due to the decentralized nature of the industrial relations system it was essential for workers to be able to take action against employers who are easily able to undermine union action by complex corporate structures transferring work or hiving off companies the committee generally raised the need to protect the right of workers to take industrial action in relation to matters which affect them even though in certain cases the direct employer may not be party to the dispute and to participate in sympathy strikes provided the initial strike they are supporting is itself lawful the committee takes note of the government indication that its position remains as set out in its report for that the rationale has not changed and that it therefore has no plans to change the law in this area and this issue forms part of a matter brought before the echr by the national union of rail maritime and transport workers rmt and that the court has yet to consider the case the committee recalls the previous concern it raised that the globalization of the economy and the delocalization of work centres may have a severe impact on the right of workers organizations to organize their activities in a manner so as to defend effectively their members interests should lawful industrial action be too restrictively defined in these circumstances the committee once again requests the government to review sections and of the tulra in full consultation with the social partners and to provide further information in its next report on the outcome of these consultations. the right to strike is protected by article paragraph of the european social charter which the united kingdom ratified on july it provides as follows with a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to bargain collectively the contracting parties undertake to recognise the right of workers and employers to collective action in cases of conflicts of interest including the right to strike subject to obligations that might arise out of collective agreements previously entered into. the european committee on social rights ecsr has examined the british rules on strike ballots and deemed them incompatible with the proper exercise of the right to strike in its most recent assessment of the matter conclusions it stated the committee considered in its previous conclusions that the requirement to give notice to an employer of a ballot on industrial action in addition to the strike notice that must be issued before taking action is excessive even the simplified requirements introduced by the employment relations act era as there have been no changes to the situation the committee reiterates its finding that the situation is not in conformity with article of the charter in this respect. like the ilo committee of experts the ecsr has consistently criticised the situation in the united kingdom in its first consideration of the matter conclusions it stated referring to the report the committee noted the government s observations concerning the limitations on the right to strike imposed by the employment act in respect of great britain in particular it noted that while the government emphasised the importance of protecting the right of employers to dismiss those engaged in a strike it also emphasised that the legislation continues to i allow special protection for peaceful pickets at their own place of work ii provide statutory immunity to peaceful and lawful pickets iii provide statutory immunity for lawful trade disputes the committee also noted the recent observations of the ilo committee of experts recommending that the legislation be amended to conform with the principle of freedom of association in accordance with ilo convention no freedom of association and protection of the right to organise having regard to this information and having noted that there is no immunity afforded individuals in respect of secondary industrial action other than inducement in the course of peaceful picketing industrial action organised in support of employees dismissed while taking part in unofficial action the committee reiterated its previous negative conclusion for the reasons cited in the twelfth cycle of supervision. conclusions xiii-i reference period in the ecsr s most recent pronouncement on the matter conclusions it said in its previous conclusions the committee found that lawful collective action was limited to disputes between workers and their employer thus preventing a union from taking action against the de facto employer if this was not the immediate employer it furthermore noted that british courts excluded collective action concerning a future employer and future terms and conditions of employment in the context of a transfer of part of a business university college london nhs trust v. unison the committee therefore considered that the scope for workers to defend their interests through lawful collective action was excessively circumscribed in the united kingdom given that there have been no changes to the situation the committee reiterates its finding that the situation is not in conformity with article of the charter in this respect. the relevant provisions are the following article freedom of assembly and of association everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all levels in particular in political trade union and civic matters which implies the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests article right of collective bargaining and action workers and employers or their respective organisations have in accordance with community law and national laws and practices the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels and in cases of conflicts of interest to take collective action to defend their interests including strike action. article appears in title iv of the charter as regards the united kingdom reference must be made to protocol no to the treaty on the functioning of the european union it provides in so far as relevant article in particular and for the avoidance of doubt nothing in title iv of the charter creates justiciable rights applicable to poland or the united kingdom except in so far as poland or the united kingdom has provided for such rights in its national law. the parties provided some elements of comparative law in relation to secondary strikes both referred to a comparative study on the regulation of industrial action in europe strike rules in the and beyond a comparative overview w. warneck european trade union institute for research education and health and safety etui-rehs according to this source secondary action is protected or permitted subject to varying restrictions and conditions in the great majority of the member states of the european union the states that like the united kingdom do not permit secondary action were identified as austria luxembourg and the netherlands in their initial submissions the government sought to draw support for the situation in the united kingdom by reference to the situation in the following states spain the netherlands italy austria norway denmark and germany they contended that these illustrated a broad tendency in europe to subject secondary action to much more restrictive conditions than primary industrial action in reply to this the applicant union provided to the court statements from labour-law experts in a number of european countries contradicting the government s remarks the applicant union concluded that the united kingdom is the most restrictive among the contracting parties to the convention in this respect the government concluded that the material demonstrated that notwithstanding the great variety of industrial-relations systems and traditions in europe most states distinguished between primary and secondary action with greater restriction on the latter the broad right claimed by the applicant union was not supported by any real european consensus the court notes that comparative information is available from the monitoring mechanism of the european social charter as indicated above this body has repeatedly criticised the situation in the united kingdom which appears to be the only state subject to criticism on this specific ground the ecsr has also commented in recent years on the lawfulness of secondary action sometimes using the term sympathy or solidarity action in the following states bulgaria croatia the czech republic denmark estonia finland germany malta norway portugal romania the slovak republic spain and sweden with reference to the three other states identified in the warneck study as not permitting secondary action the court notes that the ecsr has not criticised the situation in the netherlands on this ground nor has it made any comment at all in relation to the situation in austria or luxembourg neither state having accepted article paragraph of the social charter some further comparative information is available from the publications and legal databases of the ilo for example the committee of experts referred to the removal from the turkish constitution of the prohibition on solidarity strikes giving globalization a human face it has also referred in its review of state implementation of convention no to the lawfulness of sympathy strikes in albania georgia and latvia the committee on freedom of association has referred to solidarity strike action in hungary complaint no and noted that russian law does not expressly provide for or for that matter prohibit such action complaint no additionally the court notes that in swiss law strikes are permitted if they relate to employment relations article of the constitution according to one constitutional commentary a strike must actually be about working conditions and not pursue corporatist or
