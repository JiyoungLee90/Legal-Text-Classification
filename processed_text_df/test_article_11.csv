the case originated in two applications nos and against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national ms elvira rashitovna dmitriyeva the applicant on august and january respectively the applicant was represented by ms i. khrunova a lawyer practising in kazan and mr k. terekhov a lawyer practising in moscow the russian government the government were represented by mr m. galperin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights the applicant complained in particular of a breach of her right to freedoms of expression and assembly and the lack of an effective remedy in that respect she also complained of unlawful arrest and the lack of a prosecuting party in the administrative-offence proceedings against her on october and february the government were given notification of the above complaints and the remainder of the applications was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in kazan on march aleksey navalnyy published on youtube a documentary entitled don t call him dimon denouncing prime minister mr medvedev for alleged corruption he called on his supporters to protest on march mr navalnyy s followers in many towns notified the local authorities of their intention to hold public assemblies against corruption on march in the majority of cases the local authorities refused to allow the assemblies despite that according to media reports between and people in ninety-seven towns took part in the country-wide anticorruption protest on march between and people were arrested and convicted of administrative offences in response to the call by mr navalnyy to protest against corruption on march the applicant notified the kazan town administration of her intention to hold a meeting from a.m. to p.m. on march which people were expected to attend she proposed three alternative sites for the town administration to choose from including a specially designated location for holding public events in krylya sovetov park the aim of the event was to protest against corruption and to demand mr medvedev s resignation on march the kazan town administration refused to approve the meeting claiming that other unspecified public events were scheduled at the locations chosen by the applicant at the same time the applicant challenged that refusal before the vakhitovskiy district court of kazan on march the applicant and mr b. notified the kazan town administration of their intention to hold a picket пикетирование against corruption from a.m. to p.m. on march she proposed four alternative sites for the town administration to choose from on march the kazan town administration refused to approve the picket claiming that other unspecified public events were scheduled at the locations chosen by the applicant at the same time it proposed another venue for the picket on march the applicant accepted the venue proposed by the town administration for the picket on march the applicant published a message on vkontakte criticising the town administration for its decision not to allow the meeting she stated in particular that the decision of march had been unlawful because the town administration had not proposed alternative locations for the meeting she further claimed that the town administration could not refuse to allow the meeting in krylya sovetov park because it was a specially designated location for public events if another event was scheduled at that location the town administration had to propose another time for the meeting in any event krylya sovetov park was very large and there was enough space for several simultaneous events she also said that the decision of march had been challenged before a court and that the proceedings were still pending she stated that people were entitled to assemble peacefully and that it had therefore been decided to hold a meeting in krylya sovetov park at p.m. on march to protest against corruption the message ended as follows invite your friends to join the group we demand answers in the streets of kazan the meeting point is near the main entrance to krylya sovetov park in kopylova street underground station aviastroitelnaya. on march the vakhitovskiy district court allowed the applicant s claim against the decision of march in part it found that the regional branch of the united russia party had earlier notified the town administration of its intention to hold public events from a.m. to p.m. on march at all three locations chosen by the applicant and at two other sites in such circumstances the town administration was to provide the applicant with well-reasoned proposals for changing the location or time of her intended meeting no such proposals had been made however the town administration s failure to propose an alternative location or time for the applicant s event had therefore been unlawful on the same day the kazan department of internal affairs warned the applicant that if she held a public event at one of the locations indicated in her notifications of and march she would be held liable on march the applicant held a meeting at the specially designated location for public events in krylya sovetov park according to the applicant about people attended the meeting which lasted for about one hour and twenty minutes according to the government about people participated in the event according to the government during the meeting the police used loudspeakers to order the participants to disperse according to the applicant no announcements were made through loudspeakers a police officer had approached her and demanded that she stop the unlawful public event referring to the vakhitovskiy district court s decision of march she had replied that the meeting was lawful no further action was taken by the police until the end of the meeting the applicant was arrested on her way home after the meeting at about p.m. and taken to a nearby police station the police immediately drew up a report stating that she had been escorted to the police station so that a report on an administrative offence could be drawn up an arrest record drawn up at the same time stated that she had been arrested in connection with an administrative offence sic under articles and of the code of administrative offences hereafter the cao for examination of the case at p.m. the police drew up a report on an administrative offence under article of the cao they noted that the applicant had organised an unauthorised public event in particular she had published a message on vkontakte calling for participation in the meeting in krylya sovetov park on march she had then held a meeting from to p.m. in which about people had participated she had notified the town administration of her intention to hold a meeting in krylya sovetov park but the town administration had refused to allow the meeting she had been allowed however to hold a picket at another location by holding an unauthorised meeting in krylya sovetov park the applicant had breached the requirements of section paragraphs and of the public assemblies act and had therefore committed an offence under article of the cao at the same time at p.m. the police also drew up a report on an administrative offence under article of the cao they repeated verbatim the report on the administrative offence under article of the cao and added that the applicant had been warned by the kazan department of internal affairs that she would be held liable if she went ahead with a public event at a location which had not been approved by the town administration the applicant had held the meeting in krylya sovetov park at p.m. on march despite that warning the police had ordered her to stop the meeting but she had not taken any actions to comply with that order the meeting had lasted until about p.m the applicant had therefore disobeyed a lawful order of the police and had thereby committed an offence under article of the cao the applicant was released at p.m. on march the aviastroitelnyy district court of kazan in two separate judgments found the applicant guilty of offences under articles and of the cao it found that she had organised an unauthorised public event including by publishing a message on vkontakte calling for participation and had refused to obey a lawful order given by the police to stop that event the court noted that the applicant had notified the town administration of her intention to hold a meeting in krylya sovetov park but that the town administration had refused to allow the meeting it had proposed that she hold a picket at another location the applicant had been warned by the kazan department of internal affairs that she would be held liable if she went ahead with the public event at locations which had not been approved by the town administration she had however held the meeting in krylya sovetov park the police had ordered her to stop the meeting but she had not complied with that order the court did not reply to the applicant s argument that the town administration s decision of march refusing to approve the meeting had been annulled on judicial review and that the meeting had therefore to be considered as authorised and lawful and the police s order to stop it unlawful the court sentenced the applicant to a fine of russian roubles rub under article of the cao and to twenty hours of community work under article of the cao the applicant appealed she reiterated her argument that the meeting organised by her had been duly notified and therefore lawful and that the police s order to stop it had been unlawful she referred to the decision of march by the vakhitovskiy district court declaring unlawful the town administration s decision of march refusing to approve the meeting and submitted that under article of the code of administrative procedure the cap that decision was subject to immediate enforcement see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others v. russia nos and others february she further referred to a constitutional court ruling of february that a public event was considered to be approved not only after receipt by the organiser of the local authorities express approval but also if the local authorities had not provided the organiser with a wellreasoned proposal for a change of location or time of the event within the statutory time-limit the applicant also argued that the public event had not created any risk to people s lives or health or to the property of persons or legal entities nor had the participants committed any unlawful acts or breached the procedure for the conduct of public events established by the public events act there had therefore been no lawful grounds to stop the public event on may the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld both judgments of march on appeal finding them lawful well reasoned and justified in reply to the applicant s arguments that the meeting had been lawful and that the police s order to stop it had been unlawful the court held as follows counsel s and the applicant s arguments that she was innocent and had been unlawfully charged under articles and of the cao because there had been no corpus delicti of the above offences in her actions as she had not breached applicable statutory requirements her guilt had not been proven by the material in the case file and the police officer s order to stop the public event had been unlawful are unsubstantiated they are based on an incorrect interpretation of the applicable legal provisions and an incorrect assessment of the facts of the present case the arguments advanced by the applicant contradict the facts established during the examination of the case and are disproved by the evidence which cumulatively shows that the applicant disobeyed a lawful order by a police officer who was fulfilling his duty to safeguard public order and ensure public safety. the court then extensively cited the applicable provisions of the domestic law see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others cited above and continued a comprehensive analysis of the applicable legal provisions and the facts of the present case leads the court to conclude that in the present case the organiser of the public event did not fully comply with the procedure for organising and holding public events which rendered the public event unlawful furthermore the judicial decision finding the town administration s failure to act unlawful did not amount to an unconditional approval of the location and time of the public event and did not exempt the organiser from fulfilling the obligations imposed by the public events act the above judicial decision did not therefore transform an unauthorised public event into an authorised one in the present case the police officer acted within the powers provided by law with the aim of fulfilling his duty to ensure public safety and order his order to stop the public event addressed to its organiser can be considered lawful in accordance with the police act the argument that the public event was to be considered as approved not only after receipt by the organiser of the local authorities approval but also if the local authorities have not provided the organiser with a well-reasoned proposal for a change of location or time of the event within the statutory time-limit is invalid the aim of the public event indicated in the notification against corruption and for prime minister medvedev s resignation differed from the real aim of the public event and the aim declared during preliminary campaigning for that event thus on march the applicant published on her vkontacte personal page campaigning material about the forthcoming public event at p.m. on march in krylya sovetov park which stated ‘ march is a nationwide protest day against corruption by russian high-ranking officials whereisdimon lookfordimon friends we have the right to assemble peacefully to discuss it has therefore been decided to hold the meeting in krylya sovetov park subsequently on july the vakhitovskiy district court found the applicant guilty of an offence under article of the cao the court noted that the applicant had given oral submissions and had pleaded not guilty it then found that on march she had published a message on vkontakte calling for participation in a meeting to be held on march in krylya sovetov park despite the fact that the town administration had refused to approve that meeting and had suggested that the applicant should hold a picket at another location she had therefore campaigned for participation in the public event before it had been approved by the competent regional or municipal authorities the court ordered the applicant to pay a fine of rub on august the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld the judgment of july on appeal finding that it had been lawful well reasoned and justified it held in particular that section of the public events act expressly prohibited organisers from campaigning for participation in a public event before it had been approved by the competent local authorities see a summary of the domestic law provisions in lashmankin and others cited above the applicant had breached that prohibition the court then repeated verbatim the parts of its judgment of may cited in paragraph above the applicant attended the hearing and made oral submissions on september the vakhitovskiy district court of kazan dismissed the applicant s claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the town administration s unlawful failure to propose alternative locations for the meeting of march as established by the judgment of march see paragraph above the court found that the applicant had not proved that she had suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the town administration s failure to act on december the supreme court of the tatarstan republic upheld that judgment on appeal finding that it had been lawful well reasoned and justified it added that on march the town administration had proposed an alternative location for the public event planned by the applicant the applicant had not substantiated her argument that that proposal concerned another public event for a summary of the domestic provisions on the procedure for the notification and conduct of public events on relevant judicial review procedures and on the liability for breaches committed in the course of public events see lashmankin and others cited above the applicable domestic provisions have since been interpreted by the supreme court as follows plenary supreme court ruling no of june deals with the application of legislation governing public events during judicial examination of administrative complaints and administrative-offence cases it provides that a refusal to approve a public event its location or time or the manner in which it is to be conducted may be challenged before a court either by the event organiser or by a person appointed by the organiser to fulfil certain organisational tasks point when examining such administrative complaints the courts have to examine whether the interference by a public authority with the right to freedom of public assembly was lawful necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim the courts must examine all the grounds advanced by the public authority and all the evidence submitted by it and assess whether the reasons for the interference were relevant and sufficient point furthermore ruling no provides that the courts must verify whether the proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner of conducting it was made within the three-day statutory time-limit failure to comply with that time-limit means that the public event must be considered to be approved by default point ruling no also provides that the courts must take into account that a proposal to change the location or time of a public event or the manner in which it is to be conducted must not be arbitrary or unreasoned they must mention specific facts showing that public interest considerations make it manifestly impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time such public interests may include normal functioning of essential public utilities social and transport infrastructure and communications such as emergency maintenance work on engineering and technical networks maintenance of public order and safety of citizens both those participating in the public event and passers-by including on account of a risk of building collapse or an expected number of participants in excess of the maximum capacity of the location disruption of pedestrians or traffic or of citizens access to residential premises or to social or transport facilities and other similar considerations at the same time inconvenience caused to citizens by a public event or an assumption by the authorities that there might be a risk of such inconvenience may not in themselves be considered valid reasons for changing the location or time of a public event for example a necessity to temporarily divert pedestrians or traffic may not be considered a valid reason for changing the location or time of a public event provided that it is possible to ensure that the traffic and the conduct of everyone involved in the event will comply with the established rules and will not lead to traffic accidents on the other hand disruption of pedestrians or traffic or a risk of disruption of essential public utility services may be considered valid reasons for proposing to change the location or time of a public event provided that holding the public event will breach traffic or public transport safety requirements or limit citizens access to residential premises or public facilities irrespective of measures taken by the public authority to ensure compliance with such requirements the public authority must therefore submit to the court evidence of specific facts making it impossible to hold the public event at the chosen location or time the courts may not take into account any circumstances which were not mentioned in the proposal to change the location or time of the public event point ruling no further provides that the courts should take into account that the public authority must suggest a specific alternative location and time for the public event compatible with its purposes and its social and political significance if approval was denied because it was prohibited to hold public events at the chosen location the public authority may suggest an alternative location for that event the organiser must reply in writing stating whether he or she accepts the proposed alternative location and/or time no later than three days before the planned date of the event the organiser may also propose another location or time for approval however if the organiser wants to change the date of the event he must submit a new notification point ruling no also explains that public events held at private premises with unrestricted public access such as shopping malls must be notified to the public authority the organiser must enclose with the notification the consent to the public event signed by the premises owner points and it is not necessary to notify a public event planned at a specially designated location for public events provided that the number of participants does not exceed the number permitted for each such location by regional law the organiser must ensure the safety of participants and must therefore make enquiries about any other events planned at the same location at the same time to make sure that the maximum capacity of the location will not be exceeded the fact that the organiser informed the public authority about the intended public event will be taken into account if he or she is held liable for failure to ensure public order and safety the public authority may propose a change of location or time of a public event to be held at a specially designated location and not requiring notification only if another public event has been scheduled to take place at the same location and time and i the number of participants of the two simultaneous events will exceed the maximum capacity of the location or ii it will not be possible to ensure the peaceful character of the simultaneous events by applying security arrangements habitually used at public events with a comparable number of participants that is to say it will be necessary to apply exceptional security measures point on the other hand a cultural event a fair or some other mass event not falling under the public events act scheduled to take place at the same specially designated location at the same time may not in itself serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event it may serve as lawful grounds for proposing to change the location or time of a public event only if information about that mass event was duly published and it will not be possible to ensure safety at the two events if they are held simultaneously point lastly ruling no provides that if a court allowed the administrative complaint before the planned date of the public event it may require the public authority not to impede the public event at the location and time chosen by the organisers if the public authority has submitted evidence showing that new grounds objectively preventing holding the public event at the chosen location or time arose after the contested decision the court may require that the public authority re-examine the issue of the event s location time or the manner in which it is to be conducted within a certain time-limit point,case originated two

the case originated in an application no against lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a ukrainian national mr oleksiy oleksandrovych vyerentsov the applicant on march the applicant was represented by mr v.m yavorskyy a lawyer practising in kyiv the ukrainian government the government were represented by their agent mr n. kulchytskyy from the ministry of justice the applicant alleged in particular that the domestic authorities had violated his rights guaranteed by article and articles and of the convention on february notice of the application was given to the government the applicant was born in and lives in lviv on august the applicant notified the lviv city mayor on behalf of a local human-rights ngo vartovi zakonu of its intention to hold a demonstration every tuesday from a.m. to p.m. near the building of the lviv regional prosecutor s office during the period between august and january the aim of the demonstration was to draw attention to the issue of corruption in the prosecution service the number of possible participants was declared as up to fifty persons there is no information as to whether any such demonstration was held prior to october see below on october the executive committee of the lviv city council lodged a claim with the seeking to restrict the demonstration announced by the applicant on october the court left the above claim without consideration as being submitted too late the executive committee resubmitted its claim on october with a request for renewal of the time-limit for lodging the claim the same day the court allowed the request and accepted the claim for examination on tuesday october further to his previous announcement of august the applicant informed the city council about the demonstration to be held on that particular day he thus organised a peaceful demonstration near the lviv regional prosecutor s office later that day between a.m. and a.m. about twenty-five persons took part they were standing on the pavement in front of the building of the prosecutor s office when the police told them that they should remain at a distance of five metres from the building that would have forced the demonstrators to stand in the road and obstruct the traffic after some discussion with the police they crossed the road and stood on a lawn on the opposite side the police however told the demonstrators that they could not stand on the lawn and should move away which meant standing in the road again and obstructing the traffic causing temporary traffic-jams immediately afterwards the applicant was called aside by two police officers they grabbed his arms and took him in the direction of the nearby police station some of the demonstrators requested the officers to show them their identification and started filming the incident the officers then let the applicant go on october the granted a request by the executive committee of the lviv city council to prohibit the holding of the pre-announced demonstrations by the applicant s ngo as from october the decision was appealed against according to the applicant on the same day he was invited to the police station on the pretext that he had failed to appear at a court hearing to which he had been summoned upon his arrival at the galytskyy district police station at about p.m. the police accused the applicant of having committed the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration on october between p.m. and p.m. the police drew up reports on those administrative offences the applicant telephoned his lawyer but the latter was not allowed onto the premises of the police station at p.m. the applicant was placed in a cell where he remained without food until p.m. on the next day october on october before taking him to the court the police drew up anew the reports on the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration in their reports they referred to provisions of the code on administrative offences and to the procedure for organising and holding meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations in the city of see paragraphs and to below the reports were signed by the applicant at p.m. the applicant was taken to the galytskyy district court he had no opportunity to study the case-file materials before the court hearing during the hearing the court rejected the applicant s request to be represented by the lawyer of his choosing on the ground that the applicant was a human-rights defender and could defend himself the applicant s request to summon and question witnesses and examine a video made during the events of october was also rejected by the court by a decision of the same day the court found the applicant guilty of committing the administrative offences of malicious disobedience to a lawful order by the police and of breaching the procedure for organising and holding a demonstration the court noted that the applicant had held a street march without the permission of the lviv city council and had ignored the lawful demands of the police to stop breaching the peace he also refused to follow the police to their station but instead called the participants in the demonstration who shouted and threatened the officers the applicant denied all accusations having heard the applicant and examined the case-file materials the court concluded that the applicant s testimony was refuted by the written reports of the police officers and the traffic police officers the court noted that the said reports had been drawn up correctly and therefore had to be taken into account it sentenced the applicant to three days of administrative detention starting from p.m. on october with reference to the relevant provisions of the code on administrative offences at around p.m. on october the applicant was released on october the applicant appealed against the court s decision of october in his appeal he complained that he had been found guilty even though he had not committed the alleged offences he noted that under article of the constitution a demonstration could be held subject to notifying the authorities and any restrictions on holding one could be imposed only by a court no permission had therefore been required he also noted that he had notified the city council twice about the gathering in question and at the time it was held there had been no court decision prohibiting it therefore he considered that he had organised the gathering of october lawfully and the conclusions of the first-instance court that he had held a meeting without permission of the city council had not been based on law as no such permission was required by domestic law he further challenged the conclusion of the police that he had notified the authorities about the event only a few hours in advance claiming that he had already done so on august furthermore in his opinion even the requirement of notification two days in advance which had been established by the procedure for organising and holding meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations in the city of lviv and to which the police referred in their reports on administrative offences was not based on law as the constitutional court in its decision of april had decided that the procedure for such notification had to be a matter for legislative regulation the applicant further maintained in his appeal that in the absence of any lawful restrictions on holding a demonstration demands by the police to stop such an event could not be considered lawful and the law did not provide for liability for disobeying unlawful demands of police officers he finally complained that the first-instance court had violated his right to defend himself as it had refused to allow his lawyer to appear in the case on the ground that the applicant was a human-rights defender and therefore able to defend his rights himself in a supplement to his appeal of october the applicant complained that his punishment violated article of the convention referring to provisions of article and b-d of the convention he further complained that his right to defend himself had been violated and that the first-instance court had refused to question the witnesses and to examine a video record of the peaceful demonstration on october the lviv regional court of appeal examined the applicant s appeal in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer and rejected it it summarised the findings of the first-instance court and the arguments of the applicant s appeal the court noted that the findings of the first-instance court as to the applicant s guilt were well-founded and corresponded to the factual circumstances of the case those findings in the court s opinion were confirmed by the police reports and other explanations and evidence in reply to the applicant s arguments to the effect that there had been no corpus delicti in his actions the court of appeal noted that they should be disregarded because they were refuted by the body of evidence in the case without elaborating further on that point the court referred in its decision to the relevant provisions of the code on administrative offences the relevant provisions of the constitution read in so far as relevant as follows article human and citizens rights and freedoms affirmed by this constitution are not exhaustive constitutional rights and freedoms are guaranteed and shall not be abolished the content and scope of existing rights and freedoms shall not

and development of the socialist system guarantees to the citizens of the ussr the freedom to hold meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations exercise of these political freedoms shall be

street procession or demonstration if the goal of the event in question is contrary to the constitution of the ussr the constitutions of the republics of the union or of the autonomous republics or poses a threat to the public order and safety of citizens. by enacting this law the supreme soviet of the approved a number of decrees of the presidium including the above-mentioned decree of july the resolution provides in particular before the relevant legislation of ukraine is enacted the legislation of the ussr shall be applicable within the territory of the republic in respect of issues that have not been regulated by the legislation of ukraine and in so far as they do not contravene the constitution and legislation of ukraine. this decision introduced the procedure for organising peaceful gatherings in the city of according to that decision the freedom of assembly was guaranteed but could be restricted by a court for considerations of public health prevention of crime and disorder and protection of the rights of others to restrict such a gathering the executive council could apply to a court item of the procedure provided that notification about a planned gathering had to be given at least two working days prior to the date on which it was to be held item of the procedure specified that gatherings could not be held in the road except street marches and demonstrations on lawns and flower beds or in front of the central entrance not closer than seven metres and other entrances of administrative buildings nor could they be held in case of non-compliance with sanitary norms item of the procedure specified that holding a gathering in breach of any of the restrictions imposed by item should be considered a breach of the peace and should engage liability under the law item further provided that the organisers should be responsible for ensuring public order during a gathering item further provided that the authorities could apply to a court for the purpose of establishing the liability of persons responsible for breaching the procedure on june the lviv city council annulled the decision of april of its executive committee and ordered a new procedure on the holding of such gatherings to be drawn up in its decision the held inter alia the ministry of the interior of ukraine applied to the constitutional court of ukraine for an official interpretation of the provisions of article of the constitution of ukraine regarding timely notification to executive authorities or bodies of local self-government of planned meetings rallies marches or demonstrations in this constitutional application it is noted that under article of the constitution of ukraine citizens have the right to assemble peacefully without arms and to hold meetings rallies marches or demonstrations following prior notification to the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government however it is stressed that the current legislation of does not provide for a specific time-limit within which the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government are to be notified about such actions the holds as follows the provisions of the first part of article of the constitution of ukraine on the timely notification to the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government about planned meetings rallies marches or demonstrations relevant to this constitutional application shall be understood to mean that where the organisers of such peaceful gatherings are planning to hold such an event they must inform the above-mentioned authorities in advance that is within a reasonable time prior to the date of the planned event these time-limits should not restrict the right of citizens under article of the constitution of ukraine but should serve as a guarantee of this right and at the same time should provide the relevant executive authorities or bodies of local self-government with an opportunity to take measures to ensure that citizens may freely hold meetings rallies marches and demonstrations and to protect public order and the rights and freedoms of others specifying the exact deadlines for timely notification with regard to the particularities of different forms of peaceful assembly the number of participants the venue at what time the event is to be held and so on is a matter for legislative regulation in its review the supreme court noted inter alia as follows no legislation has been enacted in establishing a mechanism for fulfilling the right to freedom of peaceful assembly according to the resolution of the verkhovna rada of ukraine of september no on temporary application of certain legislative acts of the soviet union the normative acts of the ussr remain in force applying in order of legal rank for example the decree of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr of july on the procedure for organising and holding meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations in the ussr the note mentioned inter alia as follows the legislation of does not currently have a special law regulating public relations in the sphere of peaceful assembly one of the urgent problems to be settled by such a law is the time-limits for notifying the authorities of a planned peaceful gathering in order to ensure that it is held in safe conditions article of the constitution of ukraine while providing that the executive authorities or bodies of local self-government must be notified in a timely manner that a peaceful gathering is to be held does not establish specific deadlines for such notification the uncertainty of this matter results in the relevant constitutional norm being applied inconsistently and thus requires legal regulation the judicial practice contains instances of cases restricting the right to peaceful assembly being decided on the basis of the procedure for organising and holding meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations laid down by the decree of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr of july no on the procedure for organisation and holding of meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations in the ussr this approach is incorrect since the norms of this decree establish the procedure for authorising registering peaceful assembly and empower the authorities and bodies of local self-governments to ban such events whereas the norms of the constitution of ukraine provide for a procedure whereby the authorities are notified that a gathering is to be held and provides that only the courts have power to ban a peaceful gathering the above-mentioned legal act should not be applied by courts when deciding such cases in the judgment of the babushkinsky district court of dnipropetrovsk of march in the case of s. v. the executive committee of the dnipropetrovsk city council concerning the adoption of regulations on holding mass events in the city of dnipropetrovsk the court held inter alia that the procedures for exercising the right to freedom of assembly and the procedures and grounds for restricting the right were not regulated by ukrainian legislation and therefore the council had no grounds for adopting the impugned regulation which would interfere with the rights of citizens in another case the in a judgment of november restricted the right of several ngos and private persons to hold a demonstration on account in particular of their failure to notify the kyiv city state administration of their intention ten days in advance the court referred to the decree the participants appealed against that judgment on may the kyiv administrative court of appeal quashed the judgment of the first-instance court in its decision the court of appeal noted that the decree conflicted with the constitution as it required the organisers to seek permission to hold a demonstration and authorised the executive authorities to ban such an event whereas article of the constitution provided that the authorities should be notified that a demonstration was being planned and empowered only the judicial authorities to place restrictions on the organisation thereof it also noted that in its decision of april see paragraph above the had not referred to the decree as a normative act which should apply in to the legal relations under consideration the court also noted that the file contained no documents proving that notification about the demonstration less than days in advance had not allowed the police to ensure public order during the demonstration and that the holding of such an event could create a real risk of riots or crimes or endanger the health of the population and imperil the rights and freedoms of others it concluded that the judgment of the first-instance court was incompatible with article of the constitution and article of the convention in another case the kyiv administrative court of appeal in a decision of october quashed the judgment of the which had restricted the freedom of peaceful assembly in respect of a number of political and non-governmental organisations upon an application by the kyiv city state administration in its decision the administrative court of appeal noted that in deciding the case the first-instance court had had regard to the provisions of the decree whereas since the question of holding peaceful gatherings had been regulated by the constitution the court further stated that the decree conflicted with the constitution as it provided for a procedure for seeking permission to hold a demonstration and that the decree concerned the holding of such events in a non-existent country the ussr regulated relations between the citizens of the ussr and the executive committees of the soviets of people s deputies and considered demonstrations on the basis of their compatibility with the constitution of the ussr the constitutions of the union and the autonomous republics that is non-existent constitutions of non-existent subjects the court also noted that under the ukrainian constitution human rights and freedoms and the relevant safeguards could be defined only by the laws of according to the ukrainian helsinki human rights union in the ukrainian authorities sought to restrict peaceful gatherings in cases and in of the cases they succeeded at the request of a ukrainian mp the ministry of justice sent an information letter to an ngo in kyiv the text of this letter can be found on the official website of the ukrainian parliament the relevant parts of the letter read as follows it should be noted that the current legislation on the organisation and holding of peaceful demonstrations is not perfect for example today the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations is regulated by the decree of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the ussr of july n on the organisation and holding of meetings rallies street marches and demonstrations in the ussr hereinafter the decree which in accordance with paragraph of chapter xv transitional provisions of the constitution of ukraine − is effective in so far as it does not contradict the constitution of ukraine the above decree defined in particular which persons were authorised to contact the executive bodies of village settlement and town councils to notify them of proposed peaceful demonstrations requirements for the content of such notifications requirements for the executive bodies of village settlement and town councils in ensuring conditions for the holding of a peaceful demonstration etc thus the requirements as to the organisation and holding of peaceful demonstrations the time-limit for notification to be given to executive or local government bodies the documents to be attached to the application for holding the event etc are currently not regulated by law given the inadequacy of the current state of the legal regulation of the procedure for the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations which results in problems in the application of law since the legal norms are not formulated with sufficient clarity and are subject to ambiguous interpretation by those wishing to have recourse to them including bodies of local government only legislative regulation of the procedure for organising and holding such demonstrations will eliminate the negative practices that have arisen because of the need for legislative support for the practical application of the aforesaid right defined by article of the constitution of ukraine to assemble peacefully without arms and to hold meetings rallies demonstrations pickets and marches the ministry of justice has drafted the law of ukraine on the organisation and conduct of peaceful demonstrations which was submitted by the government of ukraine to the verkhovna rada of ukraine registration n from may and was approved by the parliament on its first reading on june the draft law mentioned in the letter is currently awaiting its second reading in parliament the guidelines provide in so far as relevant as follows section a advance notice the legal provisions concerning advance notice should require a notice of intent rather than a request for permission the notification process should not be onerous or bureaucratic the period of notice should not be unnecessarily lengthy but should still allow adequate time prior to the notified date of the assembly for the relevant state authorities to plan and prepare for the event and for the completion of an expeditious appeal to a tribunal or court should the legality of any restrictions imposed be challenged if the authorities do not promptly present any objections to a notification the organizers of a public assembly should be able to proceed with the planned activity in accordance with the terms notified and without restriction. section b interpretative notes the legal framework regulating freedom of assembly in domestic law freedom of peaceful assembly should be accorded constitutional protection that ought to contain at a minimum a positive statement of both the right and the obligation to safeguard it there should also be a constitutional provision that guarantees fair procedures in the determination of the rights contained therein constitutional provisions however can not provide for specific details or procedures as such general constitutional provisions can be abused and of themselves afford unduly wide discretion to the authorities domestic laws regulating freedom of assembly must be consistent with the international instruments ratified by that state and the legitimacy of domestic laws will be judged accordingly domestic laws must also be interpreted and implemented in conformity with the relevant international and regional jurisprudence legality any restrictions imposed must have a formal basis in primary law the law itself must be sufficiently precise to enable an individual to assess whether or not his or her conduct would be in breach of the law and to foresee what the consequences of such breaches would likely be the incorporation of clear definitions in domestic legislation is vital to ensuring that the law remains easy to understand and to apply and that regulation does not encroach upon activities that ought not to be regulated definitions should therefore be neither too elaborate nor too broad. advance notification it is common for the regulatory authority to require advance written notice of public assemblies such a requirement is justified by the state s positive duty to put in place any necessary arrangements to facilitate freedom of assembly and protect public order public safety and the rights and freedom of others the un human rights committee has held that a requirement to give notice while a de facto restriction on freedom of assembly is compatible with the permitted limitations laid down in article of the iccpr similarly the european commission on human rights in rassemblement jurassien stated that such a procedure is in keeping with the requirements of article if only in order that the authorities may be in a position to ensure the peaceful nature of the meeting and accordingly does not as such constitute interference with the exercise of the right. the notification process should not be onerous or bureaucratic as this would undermine the freedom of assembly by discouraging those who might wish to hold an assembly furthermore individual demonstrators should not be required to provide advance notification to the authorities of their intention to demonstrate where a lone demonstrator is joined by another or others then the event should be treated as a spontaneous assembly the period of notice should not be unnecessarily lengthy normally no more than a few days but should still allow adequate time prior to the notified date of the assembly for the relevant state authorities to plan and prepare for the event deploy police officers equipment etc for the regulatory body to give a prompt official response to the initial notification and for the completion of an expeditious appeal to a tribunal or court should the legality of any restrictions imposed be challenged the official receiving the notice should issue a receipt explicitly confirming that the organizers of the assembly are in compliance with the applicable notice requirements the notice should also be communicated immediately to all state organs involved in the regulatory process including the relevant police authorities notification not authorization legal provisions concerning advance notice should require a notice of intent rather than a request for permission although lawful in several jurisdictions a permit requirement accords insufficient value to both the fundamental freedom to assemble and to the corresponding principle that everything not regulated by law should be presumed to be lawful those countries where a permit is required are encouraged to amend domestic legislation so as to require notification only it is significant that in a number of jurisdictions permit procedures have been declared unconstitutional any permit system must clearly prescribe in law the criteria for issuance of a permit in addition the criteria should be confined to considerations of time place and manner and should not provide a basis for content-based regulation if the authorities do not respond promptly to a notification the organizers of a public assembly may proceed with the activities according to the terms notified without restriction even in countries where authorization rather than notification is still required authorization should be presumed granted if a response is not given within a reasonable time. at its plenary session october the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission adopted an opinion interpreting the osce/odihr guidelines on drafting laws on freedom of assembly with regard to the regulation of public meetings including the requirement of advance notice of demonstrations in public places establishing a regime of prior notification of peaceful assemblies does not necessarily extend to an infringement of the right in fact in several european countries such regimes do exist the need for advance notice generally arises in respect of certain meetings or assemblies for instance when a procession is planned to take place on the highway or a static assembly is planned to take place on a public square which require the police and other authorities to enable it to occur and not to use powers that they may validly have for instance of regulating traffic to obstruct the event. the venice commission also emphasised that the regime of prior notification must not be such as to frustrate the intention of the organisers to hold a peaceful demonstration and thus indirectly restrict their rights,case originated application lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention ukrainian

the case originated in an application no against the republic of poland lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by three polish nationals jerzy gorzelik rudolf kołodziejczyk and erwin sowa the applicants on june the applicants who had been granted legal aid were represented before the court by mr s. waliduda a lawyer practising in wrocław poland the polish government the government were represented by their agent mr k. drzewicki of the ministry of foreign affairs assisted by ms r. kowalska mr k.w czaplicki and mr d. rzemieniewski the applicants complained that the polish authorities had arbitrarily refused to register their association under the name of union of people of silesian nationality they alleged a violation of article of the convention the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the fourth section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule of the rules of court by a decision of may following a hearing on the admissibility and merits rule the chamber declared the application admissible on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule but this case remained with the chamber constituted within former section iv on an unknown date the applicants who all describe themselves as silesians together with one hundred and ninety other persons decided to form an association stowarzyszenie entitled union of people of silesian nationality związek ludności narodowości śląskiej the founders subsequently adopted a memorandum of association the applicants were elected to the provisional management committee komitet założycielski and were authorised to proceed with the registration of the association on december the applicants acting on behalf of the provisional management committee of the union of people of silesian nationality lodged an application for the registration of their association with the katowice regional court sąd wojewódzki they relied on inter alia section of the law of april on associations hereinafter referred to as the law on associations they submitted the memorandum of association along with the other documents required by the law on associations the relevant parts of the memorandum of association read the present association shall be called the union of people of silesian nationality hereinafter referred to as the union the union shall conduct its activity within the territory of the republic of poland it may establish local branches the union may join other domestic or international organisations if the aims pursued by the latter correspond to the aims pursued by the union the aims of the union are to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians to restore silesian culture to promote knowledge of silesia to protect the ethnic rights of persons of silesian nationality and to provide social care for members of the union the union shall accomplish its aims by the following means organising lectures seminars training courses and meetings establishing libraries and clubs and carrying out scientific research organising cultural and educational activities for members of the union and other persons carrying out promotional and publishing activities promoting the emblems and colours of silesia and upper silesia organising demonstrations or other protest actions organising sporting events and other forms of leisure activities setting up schools and other educational establishments cooperating with other organisations conducting business activities for the purpose of financing the aims of the union this may include establishing commercial entities and co-operating with other commercial entities establishing other entities or legal persons with a view to achieving the aims of the union and any other activities there shall be two categories of members of the union namely ordinary members and supporting members any person of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the union paragraph read in so far as relevant a person shall cease to be a member of the union if … a on a reasoned motion by the board of auditors the management board decides to deprive him of his membership b the relevant motion of the board of auditors may be based on such reasons as the fact that the member in question has not fulfilled the requirements set out in the memorandum of association for becoming a member or has failed to perform the duties of members as specified in paragraph paragraph provided the union is an organisation of the silesian national minority. on an unknown later date the katowice regional court pursuant to section of the law on associations served a copy of the applicants application together with copies of the relevant enclosures on the katowice governor wojewoda on january the katowice governor acting through the department of civic affairs wydział obywatelski submitted his comments on the application to the court these comments contain lengthy arguments against allowing the association to be registered the main thrust of which is as follows i it can not be said that there is a ‘ silesian ślązak in the sense of a representative of a distinct ‘ silesian nationality ‘ silesian is a word denoting a representative of a local ethnic group not a nation this is confirmed by paragraph of the memorandum of association which aims merely to ‘ awake and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians … ii social research relied on by the applicants to demonstrate the existence of a ‘ silesian nationality does not accord with numerous other scientific publications polish sociology distinguishes between two concepts of ‘ homeland i.e a ‘ local homeland and a ‘ ideological homeland in german this distinction is expressed by the terms heimat local homeland and vaterland ideological homeland the research relied on by the applicants merely refers to the self-identification of the inhabitants of silesia indicating that their local self-identification takes precedence over their national self-identification … iii paragraph of the memorandum of association states that any person of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the association but does not clearly specify the criteria for establishing whether or not a given person fulfils this requirement this absence of unambiguous criteria is contrary to section and of the law on associations moreover it renders paragraph b of the memorandum unlawful for that provision allows the board of management to deprive a person of his membership in the event of failure to satisfy the conditions set out in the memorandum of association … iv paragraph of the memorandum of association which calls the union an organisation of the silesian national minority is misleading and does not correspond to the facts there is no basis for regarding the silesians as a national minority recognising them as such would have been in breach of articles and of the old constitution which guarantee polish citizens equal rights in particular under the relevant provisions of the law of may on parliamentary elections hereinafter referred to as the law on parliamentary elections ordynacja wyborcza do sejmu rzeczypospolitej polskiej registration of the union would give it a privileged position in respect of the distribution of seats in parliament the union would obtain privileges and rights guaranteed to national minorities in respect of education in their native language and access to the media registration of the association would have been to the detriment of other ethnic groups in poland such as cracovians krakowiacy highlanders górale and mazurians mazurzy this would have amounted to a return to the tribalism podziały plemienne which had existed prior to the formation of the polish state … v we therefore propose that the memorandum of association should be amended so as to reflect the above observations in particular the misleading name of the association should be changed the criteria for membership should be set out in an unambiguous manner and paragraph should be deleted in our opinion these are the conditions for registration of the association. on march the applicants filed a pleading in reply to those arguments they asserted that the fact that the majority of poles failed to recognise the existence of a silesian nation did not mean that there was no such nation they cited various scientific publications and went on to explain that the fact that the silesians formed a distinct group had already been acknowledged at the end of the first world war moreover the silesians had always sought to preserve their identity and had always formed a distinct group regardless of whether upper silesia had belonged to germany or to poland consequently any comparison between them and the cracovians or highlanders was totally unjustified because the latter groups neither regarded themselves as a national minority nor had they ever been perceived as such in the past finally the applicants cited certain letters of the ministry of the interior which had been published by the press and which explained that the national and ethnic minorities bill had explicitly stated that a declaration that a person belongs to a minority shall not be questioned or verified by the public authorities on april the katowice governor filed a pleading with the court he maintained his previous position on april he produced two letters from the ministry of the interior dated february and april respectively and addressed to the department of civic affairs of the office of the katowice governor the relevant parts of the letter of february read we share your doubts as to whether certain inhabitants of silesia should be deemed to be a national minority we therefore propose that you submit your observations to the court indicating those doubts and that you ask the court to grant you leave to join the proceedings as a party we propose that you rely on the fact that the framework convention for the protection of national minorities has not been ratified by poland so that its provisions do not apply in the domestic legal system in our view neither historical nor ethnographical circumstances justify the opinion that the inhabitants of silesia can be recognised as a national minority. the relevant parts of the letter of april read as follows the arguments advanced by the provisional management committee of the association in their pleading of march do not contain any new elements in particular the framework convention does not constitute the law applicable in poland likewise the letters of the ministry of the interior on the interpretation of the national and ethnic minorities bill do not change the situation the sense of belonging to a nation falls within the realm of personal liberties it does not in itself entail any legal consequences by contrast the formation of an organisation of a national minority is a legal fact which entails legal consequences such as for instance those referred to in the law on parliamentary elections in the circumstances the registration of the association called the union of people of silesian nationality could be allowed provided that the existence of such a nation had been established. on april the applicants submitted a further pleading to the court they criticised the arguments of the ministry of the interior pointing out that the latter had failed to indicate any legal basis for rejecting their application in particular the authorities had not shown that any provision of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law whereas under section of the law on associations the exercise of the right to association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by statute and are necessary for ensuring the interests of national security or public order and for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others lastly the applicants stated that they would not to amend the memorandum of association in the manner proposed by the authorities in particular in respect of the name of the association and the content of paragraph they agreed however to amend paragraph of the memorandum and phrased it as follows everyone who is a polish citizen and who has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of silesian nationality may become an ordinary member of the union on may the katowice regional court held an explanatory session posiedzenie wyjaśniające aimed at obtaining comments and clarifications from the parties and settling the matters in dispute on may the applicants lodged a pleading with the court maintaining that in the course of the above-mentioned session the authorities had de facto acknowledged that a silesian nation exists in particular by accepting the name of the association and certain provisions of the memorandum i.e paragraph and and paragraph they stressed however that the authorities insistence on deleting paragraph was unjustified and illogical and consequently refused to alter or delete that provision later on june the katowice governor submitted his final pleading to the court opposing the registration of the association on june a single judge sitting in camera as the katowice regional court granted the applicants application and registered their association under the name of the union of people of silesian nationality the reasons for that decision read in so far as relevant there was a dispute between the parties over the concepts ‘ nation and ‘ national minority finally the authorities concerned pleaded that the application for registration of the association should be dismissed this court has found that the application is well-founded and as such should be granted in the preamble to the law on associations the legislature guarantees everyone a cardinal right the right to freedom of association which enables citizens regardless of their convictions to participate actively in public life and to express different opinions and to achieve individual interests freedom of association is one of the natural rights of a human being for this reason section of the law on associations does not establish the right to freedom of association but merely sets out the manner and limits of its exercise thus reflecting poland s international obligations under section of the law on associations the right to form an association may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by statute either in the interests of national security or public safety or in the interests of public order or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others no other restrictions may be placed on the exercise of the right to associate with others as recently as june in their pleading the authorities advanced the argument that the registration of the present association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others because it would result in an unequal treatment of other local communities and would diminish their rights this argument is unconvincing since it does not emerge from the content of the memorandum of association that the future activities of the association are aimed at diminishing the rights and freedoms of others pursuant to paragraph of the memorandum of association the aims of the association are for example to awaken and strengthen the national consciousness of silesians to restore silesian culture to promote knowledge of silesia and to provide social care for members of the association none whatsoever of these aims is directed against the rights and freedoms of others the means to be used for accomplishing these aims are not directed against the rights and freedoms of others either those means include organising lectures and seminars carrying out scientific research establishing libraries organising cultural and educational activities for members and other persons carrying out promotional and publishing activities promoting the emblems and colours of silesia and upper silesia organising demonstrations and protest actions organising sporting events setting up schools and other educational establishments conducting business activities and co-operating with other organisations in sum the argument that the association would infringe the rights and freedoms of others must definitely be rejected moreover it should be noted that this argument refers to a mere possibility because only practical action taken by the association could possibly demonstrate whether and if so to what extent the future activities of the association would necessitate the use of measures aimed at protecting the rights of others as regards the terms ‘ silesian nationality or ‘ silesian national minority the problems involved in the determination of their proper meaning can not be examined by this court in detail this court must pursuant section of the law on associations rule on the present application within a period not exceeding three months from the date on which it was lodged it is therefore not possible in the course of the present proceedings to determine such complicated issues which involve problems falling within the sphere of international relations it is however possible to assume for the purposes of making a ruling in these proceedings that the nationality of an individual is a matter of choice for him moreover it is a matter of common knowledge that the original inhabitants of silesia constitute a minority in upper silesia at least for anyone who has ever spent some time in this region and has been willing to perceive this fact after all the authorities although they rend their garments sic complaining that the applicants dared to establish an association do not contest the fact that the silesians are an ethnic minority in view of the foregoing this court finding that the provisional management committee complied with the requirements laid down in sections and read in conjunction with section of the law on associations and article of the code of civil procedure holds as in the operative part of the decision on july the katowice governor lodged an appeal with the katowice court of appeal sąd apelacyjny asking that the first-instance decision be quashed that the case be remitted to the court of first instance and that expert evidence be obtained in order to determine the meaning of the terms nation and national minority in his appeal he alleged that the court of first instance had violated sections and of the law on associations and unspecified provisions of the code of civil procedure the reasons for the appeal read in so far as relevant the court of first instance formally recognised and legally sanctioned the existence of a distinct silesian nation constituting a ‘ silesian national minority in our opinion such an important and unprecedented ruling which is of international significance could not and should not be given without defining the concepts of ‘ nation and ‘ national minority the regional court leaving this issue aside merely because of certain statutory time-limits –simplified the proceedings in an unacceptable manner this led in itself to a failure on the part of the court to establish all the circumstances relevant to the outcome of the case and furthermore provided a sufficient basis for this appeal the appellant admits that polish law does not define the terms ‘ nation and ‘ national minority this however does not justify the conclusion of the regional court that ‘ the nationality of an individual is a matter of choice for him the appellant does not contest the right of a person to decide freely to belong to a national minority however a precondition for making such a choice is the existence of a ‘ nation with which that person identifies himself the decision appealed against proclaims the opinion that the subjective feelings of the person concerned suffice for the purposes of creating a ‘ nation or a ‘ nationality having regard to the potential social repercussions of such an approach it is not possible to agree with it in these circumstances prior to making any decision on the registration of the ‘ union of people of silesian nationality it is necessary to determine whether a ‘ silesian nation exists a distinct non-polish nation and whether it is admissible in law to create a ‘ silesian national minority in the appellant s opinion there are no objective arguments in favour of the finding that a distinct silesian nation exists in case of doubt this question should be resolved by obtaining evidence from experts in the contested decision the lower court in principle focused on determining whether the aims of the association and the means of accomplishing those aims were lawful … the appellant does not contest the majority of these aims it must be said that such activities as restoring silesian culture promoting knowledge of silesia or providing social care for members of the association are worthy of respect and support however these aims can fully be accomplished without the contested provision of the memorandum of association i.e paragraph in addition the applicants were not prevented from incorporating the above-mentioned aims into the memorandum of an existing association called the ‘ movement for the autonomy of silesia ruch autonomii śląska the more so as the applicants belong to influential circles of the latter organisation the fact that the applicants have failed to do so but instead are creating a new association and are describing themselves as a ‘ silesian national minority clearly demonstrates what their real objective is in fact their objective is to circumvent the provisions of the law of may on parliamentary elections under which parties or other organisations standing in elections must reach a threshold of or of the vote in order to obtain seats in the parliament legal acts including the act of adopting a memorandum of association are null and void under article of the civil code if they aim at evading or circumventing the law legal theory formulates the opinion that defects in legal acts as defined in article of the civil code may constitute a basis for refusing to register an association sanctioning the rights of the ‘ silesian national minority amounts to discrimination against other regional and ethnic groups or societies this will be the case at least as regards electoral law and will be contrary to article of the constitution … the katowice court of appeal heard the appeal on september the katowice prosecutor of appeal prokurator apelacyjny appeared at the hearing and asked the court to grant him leave to join the proceedings as a party intervening on behalf of the katowice governor the leave was granted the court next heard addresses by the appellant the prosecutor who requested the court to set aside the first-instance decision and dismiss the applicants application and the representative of the applicants on the same day the court set aside the first-instance decision and dismissed the applicants application for their association to be registered the reasons for that decision read in so far as relevant the lower court by registering the association entitled ‘ union of people of silesian nationality approved paragraph of the memorandum of association which states that the union is an organisation of the silesian national minority we therefore agree with the appellant that the union on the basis of the above-mentioned paragraph would have the right to benefit from the statutory privileges laid down in section of the law on parliamentary elections furthermore recognising the silesians as a national minority may also result in further claims on their part for privileges granted to national minorities by other statutes contrary to the opinion expressed by the lower court it is possible to determine whether or not the silesians constitute a national minority in poland it is not necessary to obtain expert evidence in that connection under article of the code of civil procedure facts that are a matter of common knowledge i.e those which every sensible and experienced citizen should know do not need to be proved common knowledge includes historical economical political and social phenomena and events it is therefore clear that at present no legal definition of ‘ nation and ‘ national minority is commonly accepted in international relations on the other hand an ‘ ethnic group is understood as a group which has a distinct language a specific culture and a sense of social ties is aware of the fact that it differs from other groups and has its own name polish ethnographic science of the and centuries describes ‘ silesians as an autochthonous population of polish origin residing in silesia a geographical and historical region at present as a result of political and social changes the term ‘ silesians refers equally to immigrant inhabitants who have been residing in this territory for several generations and who have been identifying themselves with their new region of residence it also refers to the german-speaking population linked with silesia by such factors as birth residence and tradition see the encyclopaedia published by the polish scientific publishers in the applicants derive the rights they claim from the principles set out in the framework convention for the protection of national minorities stating that every person belonging to a national minority has the right freely to choose to belong or not to belong to such a minority in invoking european standards they fail however to remember that a national minority with which a given person identifies himself must exist there must be a society established on the basis of objective criteria with which this person wishes to identify no one can determine his national identity in isolation from a fundamental element which is the existence of a specific nation it emerges from the above-mentioned definition of a ‘ nation that a nation is formed in a historical process which may last for centuries and that the crucial element which forms a nation is its self-identification that is to say its national awareness established on the basis of the existing culture by a society residing on a specific territory certainly the silesians belong to a regional group with a very deep sense of identity including their cultural identity no one can deny that they are distinct this does not however suffice for them to be considered as a distinct nation they have never commonly been perceived as a distinct nation and they have never tried to determine their identity in terms of the criteria for a ‘ nation on the contrary the history of silesia unequivocally demonstrates that autochthonous inhabitants of this region have preserved their distinct culture and language the latter having polish roots from an ethnic point of view even though their territories were not within the borders of the polish state and even though they were under strong german influence they are therefore silesians in the sense of inhabitants of the region not in the sense of their nationality thus upper silesia in its ethnic roots sic remained polish that was without a doubt demonstrated by three uprisings the role played by the silesians in building and preserving the polish character of silesia even though they remained isolated from their homeland is unquestionable however a given nation exists where a group of individuals considering themselves a ‘ nation is in addition accepted and perceived as such by others in the common opinion of polish citizens both the silesians and other regional groups or communities e.g highlanders or mazurians are perceived merely in terms of local communities in the international sphere poland and similarly france and germany are perceived as single-nation states regardless of the fact that there exist distinct ethnic groups e.g the inhabitants of alsace or lorraine in france or the inhabitants of bavaria in germany on the whole sociologists agree that the silesians constitute an ethnic group and that the autochthonous inhabitants of silesia do have some features of a nation but that those features are not fully developed that means that the awakening of their national identity is still at a very early stage a nation exists only when there are no doubts as to its right to exist in poland national minorities do constitute only a small part of the society that is to say about they comprise and this has never been denied germans ukrainians belarusians lithuanians slovaks czechs jews roma armenians and tatars in the polish tradition national minorities are perceived as groups linked to a majority outside poland in other words a minority is an ethnic group which has support amongst a majority residing abroad moreover traditionally our society has not considered that groups which preserve a distinct culture but which do not belong to any state can be deemed to be national minorities accordingly for a long time the roma people were regarded as an ethnic not a national group the applicants opinion that the mere choice of the individual concerned is decisive for his nationality is reflected in paragraph of the memorandum of association acceptance of this opinion would consequently lead to a situation in which the aims pursued by the association could be accomplished by groups of members who did not have any connection or links with silesia and who had become members of the union solely to gain an advantage for themselves undoubtedly such groups of members can not be allowed to accomplish the aims of an association of a national minority the applicants have relied on the results of sociological research carried out in in katowice province indeed the research demonstrates that of persons requested to declare their ethnic and regional identity replied that they were silesians however it transpires from the material collected in the course of another piece of sociological research of which was submitted by the applicants during the appellate hearing that two years later the number of persons considering themselves to be silesians had decreased to and that moreover the majority of inhabitants of katowice province considered themselves to be poles i.e including who stated that they were ‘ polish silesians only of inhabitants considered themselves to be germans including who stated that they were ‘ german silesians in the light of the above research it can not be said that such a poorly established self-identity of a small and decreasing group of silesians as demonstrated by their refusal to declare that they belong to the polish nation provides a basis for recognising that all silesians who have lived in silesia for generations and state that they belong to the polish nation constitute a separate nation this would be contrary to the will of the majority a will well known to the applicants we therefore find that the appellant is right in submitting that granting the applicants application for their association to be registered is unjustified because the memorandum of association is contrary to the law i.e article of the civil code thus the application is aimed at registering an organisation of a minority which can not be regarded as a national minority and at circumventing the provisions of the law on parliamentary elections and other statutes conferring particular privileges on national minorities granting such a request could lead to granting unwarranted rights to the association in question this would moreover place their organisation at an advantage in relation to other regional or ethnic organisations in these circumstances under section of the law on associations and article of the civil code read in conjunction with articles and of the code of civil procedure and section of the law on associations the appeal must be allowed on november the applicants lodged a cassation appeal kasacja with the supreme court sąd najwyższy they alleged that the katowice court of appeal had wrongly interpreted the relevant provisions of the law on associations and that the impugned decision had contravened article of the constitution article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the convention their arguments may be summarised as follows the principal issue to be determined by the court of appeal was whether the memorandum of the applicants association complied with the statutory requirements since a refusal to register an association could be justified only if an activity specified in the memorandum of association was banned by the law that was clearly not the case and the court s fear that the registration of the applicants association would in future lead to discrimination against other national or ethnic minorities was based on mere speculation in any event the law on associations in sections et seq provided for various means whereby the activity of an association could be supervised by the competent state authorities or in the event that its activity was unlawful the association could be dissolved however the court of appeal instead of assessing formal requirements of the registration firstly decided that the core issue in the proceedings was to establish whether a silesian nation existed it consequently went on to lay down its own arbitrary and controversial definition of ‘ nation and ‘ national minority and finally concluded that there was no ‘ silesian nation it did so without any effort to obtain expert evidence in respect of such an important matter. on november the katowice governor filed a pleading in reply to the applicants cassation appeal the relevant arguments may be summarised as follows the refusal to register the applicants association was fully justified in the course of the proceedings at first instance the governor eventually proposed that the applicants amend paragraph of the memorandum of association and alter the name of their association by deleting the word ‘ nationality those arguments were based on section of the law of associations which provides that a memorandum of association should enable the association in question to be differentiated from other associations this means that the name of an association should not be misleading since the requirement set out in the above-mentioned section was not complied with the refusal to register the applicants association was justified under section it must be stressed that even in the explanatory report to the framework convention for the protection of national minorities it is clearly stated that the individual s subjective choice to belong to a national minority is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to the person s identity that means that a given nation must exist prior to the individual making a decision to belong to this nation that being so the applicants application for their association to be registered must be seen as a thoughtless and incomprehensible attempt to exploit the distinct characteristics of the silesians with a view to achieving political aims. on november the katowice prosecutor of appeal filed a pleading in reply to the applicants cassation appeal he submitted inter alia that it was clear that the content of the memorandum of association was contrary to the law since it explicitly stated that the union was an association of a national minority and thus ignored the fact that the silesians could not be regarded as a minority of that kind the silesians being merely an ethnic group could not exercise the rights conferred on national minorities in particular those referred to in the law on parliamentary elections on march a panel of three judges sitting as the administrative labour and social security chamber of the supreme court dismissed the applicants cassation appeal the relevant parts of the reasons for this decision read as follows … a necessary prerequisite for the registration of an association is the conformity of its memorandum of association with the entire domestic legal order including conformity with the provisions of international treaties ratified by poland in the present case the court of appeal had no doubts as to the lawfulness of the aims pursued by the applicants association but refused to register the association for the sole reason that the applicants in the memorandum of association used such terms as ‘ silesian nation and ‘ silesian national minority we agree with the opinion of the court of appeal ‘ national minority is a legal term article of the constitution of february although it is not defined either in polish law or in the conventions relied on in the cassation appeal however the explanatory report to the framework convention for the protection of national minorities states plainly that the individual s subjective choice of a nation is inseparably linked to objective criteria relevant to his national identity that means that a subjective declaration of belonging to a specific national group implies prior social acceptance of the existence of the national group in question … an individual has the right to choose his nation but this as the court of appeal rightly pointed out does not in itself lead to the establishment of a new distinct nation or national minority there was and still is a common perception that an ethnic group of silesians does exist however this group has never been regarded as a national group and it has not claimed to be regarded as such … registration of the association which in paragraph of its memorandum of association states that it is an organisation of a specific national minority would be in breach of the law because it would result in a non-existent ‘ national minority taking advantage of privileges conferred on genuine national minorities this concerns in particular the privileges granted by the law on parliamentary elections such as an exemption from the requirement that a party or other organisation standing in elections should receive at least of the vote which is a prerequisite for obtaining seats in parliament or privileges in respect of the registration of electoral lists thus it suffices for an organisation of a national minority to have registered its electoral lists in at least five electoral constituencies whereas the general requirement is to register an electoral list in at least a half of the electoral constituencies in the whole of poland pursuant to the relevant ruling of the constitutional court trybunał konstytucyjny on the interpretation of the law on parliamentary elections the privileges referred to above are conferred on electoral committees of registered national minorities and in the event of any doubt as to whether or not an electoral committee represents a national minority the state electoral college may request evidence the simplest means of proving the existence of a specific national minority is to present a memorandum of association confirming that fact it is true that under the new constitution resolutions of the constitutional court on the interpretation of statutes no longer have universally binding force however in view of the persuasiveness of the reasons given by the constitutional court and the requirements of practice we consider that a memorandum of association still remains basic evidence demonstrating the existence of a national minority furthermore conferring on the silesians an ethnic group the rights of a national minority would be contrary to article of the constitution stating that all persons are equal before the law because other ethnic minorities would not enjoy the same rights the memorandum of association is contrary to section of the law on associations which stipulates that a memorandum of association must set out rules concerning acquisition and loss of membership and the rights and duties of members paragraph of the memorandum provides that everyone who is a polish citizen and has submitted a written declaration stating that he is of silesian nationality may become a member of the union whereas paragraph states that a person ceases to be a member of the union if inter alia he has not fulfilled the membership requirements set out in the memorandum of association since no silesian nation exists no one would lawfully be able to become a member of the union because his declaration of silesian nationality would be untrue … furthermore it must be pointed out that the refusal to register the association does not contravene poland s international obligations both the international covenant on civil and political rights and the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms allow the state to place restrictions on the freedom of association in particular such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety or for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights of others it is contrary to the public order to create a non-existent nation that would be able to benefit from the privileges conferred solely on national minorities such a situation would also lead to the infringement of the rights of others not only national minorities but also all other citizens of poland granting privileges to a specific group of citizens means that the situation of the other members of society becomes correspondingly less favourable this is particularly so in the sphere of election law if certain persons may become members of parliament because of their privileged position it means that other candidates must obtain a higher number of votes than what would be required in the absence of privileges in that respect it also has to be noted that the essential aims of the association can be accomplished without the contested provisions of the memorandum and without the specific name of the association under the provisions of the constitution of the republic of poland national and ethnic minorities have equal rights as regards their freedom to preserve and develop their own language to maintain their customs and traditions to develop their culture to establish educational institutions or institutions designed to protect their religious identity and to participate in the resolution of matters relating to their cultural identity article … article of the constitution which was adopted by the national assembly on april and entered into force on october states the republic of poland shall ensure freedom for the creation and functioning of trade unions socio-occupational farmers organisations societies citizens movements other voluntary associations and foundations. article of the constitution reads political parties and other organisations whose programmes are based upon totalitarian methods or the models

council for authorisation to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of the parliament building on february to protest against the non-transparent manner of organising the eurovision song contest in on february the chişinău municipal council rejected the application on the grounds that the parliament was not responsible for organising the eurovision song contest which took place in ukraine and the

convention it also asked that the case be examined urgently during the court proceedings the chişinău municipal council relied on two new reasons for rejecting hyde park s application to hold a

appeal dismissed the applicants action finding that the municipal council had lawfully rejected its application and upholding all the reasons relied upon by it moreover the court gave a new reason in favour of the municipality s decision not to authorise the demonstration namely that in its request for authorisation hyde park had failed to correctly indicate the aim of its protest in particular it indicated that the protest was intended to be against the manner in which the contest was organised later during the proceedings it submitted that the intention was to protest against the non-transparent manner in which the televoting in moldova had taken place hyde park appealed against this judgment and argued that the judgment had breached the right of its members to hold peaceful

record of september the applicant was arrested for refusing to comply with a lawful order of the police following the applicant 's complaints about unlawful police actions the kuntsevskiy district prosecutor interviewed the officers who had apprehended the applicant captain f. officer d. and the driver l. stated that they had been present at the meeting site since p.m. at p.m. when people were beginning to leave they had arrested the applicant and taken him to the police station for clarification of facts namely the legal ground for holding a public assembly mr n. who had been the duty officer at the police station testified that at p.m. the head of the police station had told him to prepare a report on an administrative offence of disobedience of police orders committed by mr makhmudov who had been detained for conducting an unauthorised meeting at the police station the applicant was placed in a cell where he remained until he was brought before a judge on the following day see below the cell was dirty and covered with spittle the applicant was not given any food or drink on september the applicant was brought before a judge of the kuntsevskiy district court of moscow he was charged with disobeying lawful police orders and with organising an unauthorised assembly these being administrative offences under articles and of the code on administrative offences the two charges were examined separately examining the charge of disobedience the judge found as follows during the preparation and examination of the administrative case a number of breaches of the code of administrative offences have been revealed these breaches are the grounds for remitting the file to the head of the police station it is not clear from the case material what the offender 's stance is with regard to the offence imputed to him it appears from his statement that he has not committed any offence however in breach of article of the code the report does not list witnesses who could confirm the guilt of the offender nor does it refer to other evidence confirming the offending acts or disobedience of police orders besides it transpires from the decision on the institution of administrative proceedings and the opening of an administrative inquiry that on september an administrative inquiry was ordered but no such inquiry has actually been carried out as the file does not contain any depositions or other additional material obtained by such an inquiry furthermore pursuant to article of the code a report on an administrative offence punishable by administrative arrest must be submitted for judicial examination immediately after its issuance the administrative-arrest record concerning mr makhmudov had been prepared at p.m. on september but the material was submitted to the court only at p.m. on september finally the report contains no information as to who disobeyed the order which police officer gave the order where he gave the order house number or what kind of lawful order it was the administrative-arrest record does not refer to article of the code although the breach of that provision was the basis for the applicant 's arrest or to the grounds for arrest the record does not describe the detainee 's clothing absence or presence of bodily injuries or to whom the information about the arrest was communicated the information on the identity of attesting witnesses is incomplete the attesting witness no did not sign the record and witnesses for the defence have not been examined. the judge returned the material to krylatskoye police station for correction of the above defects and ordered the applicant 's release at p.m. on october the police resubmitted the file to the court on october the kuntsevskiy district court found that the police had not made good the defects identified in the decision of september the judge opined as follows mr makhmudov unambiguously declared himself not guilty of the imputed offence and listed the following nine witnesses as being ready to testify that he had not committed any illegal actions against the police officers taking into account that the available material is insufficient for finding mr makhmudov guilty of the administrative offence that the court has taken measures to make good the defects in the material and for supplementing the evidence and that those defects have not been remedied the court considers that all the measures for proving mr makhmudov 's guilt of the offence have been exhausted and as the available evidence is not sufficient for a finding of guilt finds it necessary to discontinue the proceedings following the applicant 's complaint that the legal basis for discontinuance of the proceedings had not been set out explicitly on december that decision was quashed by a higher court and the matter remitted for a new examination on december the kuntsevskiy district court ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings on the ground that the two-month prescription period had expired having examined the witnesses for the defence who denied that the assembly had taken place and the police officers who testified for the prosecution the judge found that the applicant had been in breach of the established procedure for organising public assemblies he had known that the prefect 's decision of august had been reversed but proceeded nevertheless with organisation of the assembly the judge fined the applicant russian roubles approximately euros on july the moscow city court upheld that decision on an appeal by the applicant the applicant challenged the prefect 's decision of september before the kuntsevskiy district court he claimed that it had no legal basis for russian law did not permit cancellation of an authorised assembly that it had been issued too late on the eve of the assembly and that it could not be founded on the operative information he also sought a declaration that the police had unlawfully dispersed the assembly by force the district court asked krylatskoye police station and the police command of the western administrative district of moscow to produce the operative information which had been the basis for cancelling the authorisation on december krylatskoye police station replied that there had been no such information in their possession on january the police command of the western administrative district replied that the material requested was classified as secret and for that reason could not be made available to the judge the applicant asked the district court to relinquish jurisdiction to the moscow city court which was competent under national law to hear cases involving confidential material in an interim decision of january the district court refused the request holding that the purpose of the proceedings was to establish whether or not the prefect 's decision had been lawful rather than whether the prefect had or had not received information from the law-enforcement authorities in a judgment of january the district court rejected the applicant 's complaint it established that the prefect had issued the contested decision further to a letter from the head of the police command of the western administrative district of september in that letter the police officer had asked the prefect to annul his decision of august because the police command had received from various sources information about potential terrorist attacks in in places of mass gatherings the district court continued as follows in the court 's view the information of law-enforcement authorities about a possibility of subversive and terrorist attacks in moscow in places of mass gatherings potentially presupposes the existing threat of violence not just against those citizens who intend to take part in the meeting but also against those citizens who had no intention of exercising their constitutional right to freedom of mass assemblies no evidence contradicting the information contained in the letter from the police command of the western administrative district to the prefect of the western administrative district has been produced before the court the prefect 's decision of september was issued not in connection with the notice filed by the assembly organisers but in connection with a threat of increasing terrorist activities in the areas of mass gatherings with a view to ensuring the security of the krylatskoye district 's residents assessing the contested decision the court finds that the prefect acted within the competence of the state body and his actions were appropriate to the presumed threat and complied with the russian constitution as regards the forceful actions of the police in dispersing the meeting the district court found as follows taking into account the submissions by the claimant and his representatives by the representatives of the police command of the western administrative district and of krylatskoye police station and having examined the video material submitted by the claimant and by krylatskoye district council the court finds that the actions of the krylatskoye district police which were aimed at preventing the mass action from taking place in connection with a real threat to life health and security of citizens were compatible with the moscow regulations on co-ordinated police action during mass assemblies and the requirements of article of the constitution which prohibits violations of rights and freedom of others including during the exercise of the constitutional right to organise meetings demonstrations marches and pickets having regard to the special conditions in the city of moscow. the applicant lodged an appeal he submitted in particular that not a single public gathering organised by the mayor 's office in the framework of the day of the city had been cancelled as a result of a potential terrorist threat he pointed out that the district court had failed to supply a concrete legal basis for the prefect 's decision to cancel the assembly permit on april the moscow city court in summary fashion rejected the applicant 's appeal on november and march the applicant lodged a civil claim for damages against krylatskoye police station the branch of the federal treasury and the ministry of the interior he sought compensation for unlawful arrest and overnight detention in inhuman conditions without sleep food or drink on july the kuntsevskiy district court dismissed the applicant 's claim finding that article of the civil code did not provide for state officials liability for non-pecuniary damage incurred through unlawful administrative arrest on april the presidium of the moscow city court quashed that decision and remitted the claim for a fresh examination on november the kuntsevskiy district court dismissed the applicant 's claim again it noted that in cases of administrative arrest state officials would be liable for non-pecuniary damage only if a fault on their part were proven the applicant had been detained for hours and minutes for his failure to comply with a lawful police order his arrest had been lawful because the constitution only required a judicial decision if the relevant period of custody exceeded forty-eight hours the administrative case against him had been discontinued on a formal ground the expiry of the prescription period rather than by a finding of his innocence having regard to these circumstances the district court found that the state officials had acted within their competence and powers and therefore could not be held liable for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant on march the moscow city court on an appeal by the applicant upheld the judgment of november endorsing in summary fashion the district court 's reasoning the constitution guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to hold meetings demonstrations marches and pickets article decree of the presidium of the ussr supreme council no of july in force at the material time pursuant to russian presidential decree no of may provided that organisers of an assembly were to serve written notice on the municipal authorities no

street marches demonstrations and pickets in streets squares and other public places approved by presidential decree no of may provided that notice of an assembly was to be served by the assembly organisers on the executive body between the fifteenth and tenth day before the planned assembly the executive body could refuse to accept the notice if the purpose of the assembly was contrary to the principles of the universal declaration of human rights generally accepted public morals if there was no undertaking on the part of the organisers to ensure public safety if the assembly coincided in time and place with another one if it threatened normal functioning of companies or organisations or if it required suspending public or rail transport the executive body in cooperation with the organisers could suggest a different place time or route of the assembly in order to ensure public safety refusal to accept notice of an assembly was amenable to judicial review the suppression of

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a senegalese national ms madjiguene cisse the applicant on november the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by mr s. foreman a lawyer practising in the french government the government were represented by their agent mr r. abraham director of legal affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs the applicant alleged a violation of article of the convention the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule by a decision of january the court declared the application partly admissible the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits rule on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule this case was assigned to the newly composed second section the applicant was a member of and a spokeswoman for a group of aliens without residence permits who in decided to take collective action to draw attention to the difficulties they were having in obtaining a review of their immigration status in france their campaign which received widespread coverage in the press culminated with the occupation of st bernard 's church in paris on june by a group of some two hundred illegal immigrants most of whom were of african origin ten men within the group decided to go on hunger strike the applicant 's daughter joined her mother as one of the occupiers of the church the movement known as the st bernard sans papiers movement was supported by several human-rights organisations some of whose activists decided to sleep on the premises in a show of solidarity with their predicament on august the paris commissioner of police signed an order for the total evacuation of the premises it was made on the grounds that the occupation of the premises was unrelated to religious worship there had been a marked deterioration in the already unsatisfactory sanitary conditions padlocks had been placed on the church exits and there were serious sanitary health peace security and public-order risks more specifically the order read as follows the director of the paris mobile emergency medical service samu was given responsibility on july for ensuring day to day care of the hunger strikers and the parish priest has been reminded of the health hazards to which the occupants were exposed by the precarious living conditions as also of the need to allow unrestricted access to the emergency services the world doctors médecins du monde organisation which offers continuous medical assistance in the church has made public alarming information on the very serious consequences of this hunger strike for the health of those concerned at the expiration of the medically critical period of forty days on the basis of the provisions of article of the code of criminal procedure the ten hunger strikers were evacuated on august solely in order for the men to be given appropriate medical check-ups in hospitals in the men returned to the aforementioned church of their own accord and immediately declared their intention to pursue their action since june there has been a marked deterioration in the already unsatisfactory sanitary conditions the available sanitary equipment being totally inadequate for the long-term use of the premises as a collective shelter the number of people present on the premises has grown considerably during the last few days and this has led to incidents in the immediate vicinity and notably on the public highway such incidents create a risk of behaviour that may result in public order disturbances the various movements concerned have erected barriers on the public highway across rue saint-bruno at the junctions with rue saint-luc and rue jérôme l'ermite the barriers obstruct the highway hindering the passage of ordinary traffic and of emergency vehicles the church doors and various exits are kept closed and in some cases padlocked to enable a filter system to be operated at the only remaining entrance that is permanently accessible and a barricade formed of barriers chained together has even been placed between the enclosure railings and the north entrance to the church chancel these installations constitute a major hazard should an emergency evacuation of the persons present inside the building become necessary these activities and movements are totally unrelated to religious worship which is the exclusive use to which this public building may be put under the law of december it follows from the matters noted above that the current situation represents a serious sanitary health peace public-security and public-order risk the following morning the police carried out the evacuation the police officers arrived at the scene at a.m. and set up a checkpoint at the church exit to verify on the basis of article subparagraphs and of the code of criminal procedure and article subparagraphs and of the ordinance of november whether the aliens evacuated from the church had documentation authorising them to stay and circulate in the territory the police entered the church at a.m. all the occupants of the church were stopped and questioned whites were immediately released while the police assembled all the dark-skinned occupants apart from those on hunger strike and sent them by coach to an aliens detention centre at orders were made for the detention and deportation of almost all of those concerned more than a hundred were subsequently released by the courts on account of certain irregularities on the part of the police which even extended to making false reports regarding the stopping and questioning procedure at a.m. a police officer asked the applicant as she was leaving the church for documentary evidence that she had leave to stay in but she was unable to produce any the applicant had attended the paris police commissioner 's office on june but on july had been refused leave to remain in france on the ground that she did not satisfy any of the conditions laid down by the ordinance of november for the issue of a residence permit and that there were no personal or family reasons justifying her being granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds she had been invited to leave french territory within one month after receipt of notification of the commissioner of police 's decision at a.m. the applicant was taken into custody and informed of her rights pursuant to articles and of the code of criminal procedure the measure was deemed to have taken effect at a.m. when she was stopped the applicant refused to speak throughout her period in custody at p.m. on august the senior deputy public prosecutor at the eighth division of the paris public prosecutor 's office instructed the police officers to bring the applicant before him with the case file as it stood at p.m. on august the applicant appeared before the paris criminal court under the immediate summary trial procedure she was accused of having entered and stayed in without being in possession of the documents or visas required by the rules and was sentenced to two-months imprisonment suspended the criminal court held the occupation of a place of worship over a period of several weeks in order to contest their immigration status and create a movement in their favour in itself constitutes an emergency justifying the administrative authority 's decision to expel them the presence in st bernard 's church of several hundred people for a period of several weeks claiming through public statements made by individuals or through spokespersons representing them status as in their own words aliens without residence permits or papers constituted grounds for suspecting that those concerned had committed offences under the immigration rules such that the verification of their identity pursuant to article was justified however since a large number of people were stopped at the same time and refused to disclose their identities the police were not able to carry out an immediate identity check the fact that the identity check was not carried out when they were first stopped but within what given the practical contingencies inherent in an operation of that size was a reasonable period thereafter does not render the proceedings defective regard being had to the large number of persons stopped and the circumstances in which the operation was conducted the defendant was notified of her rights within a reasonable time on january the paris court of appeal on appeal by the applicant upheld the sentence and added an order excluding her from french territory for three years in addition it held in its judgment the occupation of a place of worship by approximately three hundred individuals over several weeks in order to create a movement in their favour and to contest their immigration status constitutes an emergency that justified the administrative authority making an expulsion order without making a prior application to the courts the occupiers of the premises continued their hunger strike for almost forty days and the living conditions of those concerned continued to deteriorate the scale of the demonstrations over several weeks with barriers being used to obstruct the highway and hinder the passage of vehicles constituted a risk for security sanitation the health of the hunger strikers and public order that justified urgent measures being taken to put an end to the disturbances. on june the court of cassation dismissed the applicant 's appeal on points of law on the following grounds in the proceedings before the courts below in which madjiguène ndourit a senegalese national was accused of illegally entering and staying in france

persons which evacuation was followed by police identity checks that revealed that the demonstrators were illegal immigrants in these circumstances the reasons which the courts below relied on unnecessarily in dismissing her objection can not serve as a basis for complaint by the appellant since even if she had proved that the administrative act referred to above was unlawful it would have had no bearing on the outcome of the criminal proceedings. article of the criminal code provides the criminal courts shall have jurisdiction to interpret general or individual administrative decisions

regarding the ticket and he had been invited to provide one the applicant s allegation that he was questioned from a.m. to p.m. was not supported by the police records the applicant complained to the moscow transport prosecutor s office about having been unlawfully detained by the police and requested that those responsible be prosecuted on june the prosecutor s office decided not to open criminal proceedings against the policemen the decision stated in so far as relevant as follows on may the police together with the sheremetyevo airport security service carried out a check of the passengers leaving on the flight no moscow samara during the check they discovered thirteen plane tickets with traces of forgery which were seized later the police conducted an inquiry under articles of the code

printing the tickets were suspicious the police seized the tickets and removed the passengers from the flight a wrote a report concerning these facts after that the materials were sent to the sheremetyevo police unit when questioned the head of the operational-search unit of the aviation division of the department of the interior s. stated that on may on the occasion of the high-profile summit in samara the policemen of the aviation division of the moscow branch of the department of the interior together with its subordinate units in the airports of the moscow region carried out operational search activities to identify persons of an extremist nature intending to organise mass riots in this connection the police carried out checks on persons leaving for samara on may s. together with the operative officer a.b arrived at the sheremetyevo airport where at a.m. check-in began for flight moscow samara together with the airport security screening service they checked all passengers which included screening their luggage with special equipment and checking their documents during the check some officers noticed that tickets of certain passengers had additional non-standard notes and when inspected these tickets raised doubts as to their authenticity because of that thirteen suspected forged tickets were seized and the passengers were questioned about the circumstances of their purchase moreover several passengers decided not to fly without explaining why on the same day similar checks were conducted for other flights to samara the sales director of the airline confirmed that the tickets were issued and sold in a normal manner an expert examination of the twenty seized tickets revealed that seven tickets had no corrections of the original content for thirteen of the tickets the examination revealed that secondary text had been added on top of the original text in the fields ‘ flight number and ‘ time therefore the inquiry has established that the policemen had acted within their powers and with sufficient grounds when seizing the tickets of the passengers for flight moscow samara held to refuse the institution of criminal proceedings further to the complaint about the commission of criminal offences of abuse of powers and exceeding official powers by the eleven policemen involved for absence of corpus delicti. the applicant challenged this decision before a court under the procedure set out in article of the code of criminal procedure he requested that the decision dispensing with criminal proceedings be declared unlawful and that the prosecutor s office be ordered to remedy the shortcomings in it on july the golovinskiy district court of moscow examined and rejected the applicant s appeal it noted that the applicant had complained to the prosecutor s office about his five-hour detention and about the seizure of his ticket to samara it also observed that the applicant had challenged the prosecutor s refusal to open criminal proceedings claiming inter alia that the police had unlawfully restricted his liberty and in violation of his right to freedom of expression and to freedom of assembly it also noted that the applicant had claimed that he had been deprived of his constitutional rights by the prosecutor s office the court considered that the prosecutor s office had taken its decision in accordance with the procedure provided for by law and remained within its competence while doing so it upheld the finding that no criminal offence could be imputed to the police officers in question the court found the applicant s allegations about the unlawfulness of the ticket seizure to be unsubstantiated finding that the seizure had been carried out in accordance with articles and of the code of administrative offences see paragraph below the court further found that the applicant had been taken to the airport police quarters to provide an explanation for the purchase of his ticket he had not been isolated at the police station therefore there had been no grounds for applying the three-hour time-limit for the application of preventative measures in administrative offences cases as provided for by the code of administrative offences or for the drawing up of a detention report протокол о задержании the court concluded that the prosecutor s decision was lawful and well-founded the applicant brought a cassation appeal against that decision he claimed that the measures applied to him were contrary to the code of administrative offences and that there had been violations of his constitutional rights to liberty freedom of expression and freedom of assembly on august the moscow city court examined and dismissed the applicant s appeal it noted that the subject matter of the applicant s appeal to court had been the lawfulness of the prosecutor s refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the officers who had allegedly violated his constitutional rights it upheld the decision not to institute criminal proceedings as correct in substance and form it further held that the alleged breach by the police offices of statutory detention limits were outside the scope of the first-instance court s power of review section of the police act no of april as in force at the material time provided that for the performance of their duties the police had the right to obtain from citizens and state officials necessary statements information certificates documents and copies thereof article of the code of administrative offences of december provides for liability of designated officials for a failure to submit information on persons to be drafted in the armed forces to the relevant military authority article of the code allows to conduct personal searches and to

the court the applicants were represented by mr a. postică a lawyer practising in chişinău and a member of the non-governmental organisation promo-lex the moldovan government the government were represented by their agent mr vladimir grosu the applicants alleged in particular a breach of their right to freedom of assembly and to a fair trial on april the president of the fourth section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article of the convention at the time of the events giving rise to the application hyde park the first applicant was registered with the moldovan ministry of justice as a non-governmental organisation lobbying inter alia for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly in its members decided to discontinue the organisation s registration on grounds of alleged pressure and intimidation by the state in particular they complained of the refusal of the ministry of justice to register amendments to the organisation s articles of association the repeated freezing of its bank account the arbitrary arrest of its members attempts to shut down its newspaper among other things several of the organisation s leaders requested political asylum in western countries it was decided to continue the organisation s activity under the same name but without registering it with the state authorities it was also decided that the new unincorporated association would become the former organisation s successor after removal of the organisation from the government s list of non-governmental organisations on june hyde park s activities continued as before on the basis of its new articles of association the association continued editing its newspaper its internet page and continued staging protests and demonstrations the other applicants are members and supporters of hyde park gheorghe lupuşoru anatol hristea-stan mariana gălescu alina didilică and oleg brega who were born in and respectively and live in chişinău chişinău chişinău cazangic and pepeni respectively on december hyde park applied to the chişinău municipal council for authorisation to hold a peaceful meeting in front of the romanian embassy on january to protest against the policy of romania in respect of moldovan students the application was signed by hyde park s president and stated inter alia that by the present application we seek permission from the chişinău municipality to hold a public gathering on january in chişinău the members and the supporters of hyde park who study in romania or who have relatives studying there are not content with the manner in which they are treated by the romanian authorities therefore we intend to protest with them and on their behalf in front of the romanian embassy between a.m and p.m. in front of the entrance on we undertake to respect public order and not to block traffic. on december the chişinău municipal council rejected the application on the ground that the municipal police considered the applicants protest to be unfounded and unwelcome because it was the government of romania which financed the studies of moldovan students in romania and therefore the romanian authorities were competent to take a decision in respect of the applicants application of december on january the first applicant challenged the refusal in court and argued inter alia that it was unlawful it also argued that the municipal council had protracted the examination of their application until the last day of the year so as not to leave it enough time to challenge the refusal in the courts it asked that the case be examined urgently the applicant explained that many persons who had expressed their wish to participate in the demonstration were students in romania and were at home in chişinău only for the winter break on february the chişinău court of appeal dismissed the applicants action finding that the municipal council had acted within its competence the court observed that the police the prosecutor s office and the secret service had obtained information that the applicants intended to breach the provisions of sections and of the assemblies act hyde park appealed against this judgment and argued that the judgment had breached the right of its members to hold peaceful meetings in public places it also argued that no evidence had been presented to support the view that the holding of the demonstration would have given rise to an infringement of sections and of the assemblies act on june the supreme court of justice upheld the appeal quashed the judgment of the first-instance court and ordered a re-examination of the case the supreme court found that there was no evidence that the applicants intended to breach sections and of the assemblies act on october the chişinău court of appeal again dismissed the action on the basis that the holding of a protest meeting in front of the romanian embassy could have prejudiced the image of the moldovan state and of the moldovan people moreover the decision to hold a protest meeting had not been adopted by the council of hyde park as required by its statutes additionally the hyde park statutes did not contain in its list of activities provisions sanctioning actions such as holding protest meetings the first

committee shall be responsible for the financial administration of projects the accounting of the committee and manage everyday administrative господарчу and financial activities to ensure the implementation of projects on an unspecified date the application and articles of association were returned to the applicants and they were advised to make changes to the text which were noted down by the city department in the same documents in particular several sentences and paragraphs were crossed out including paragraphs d and some other parts of the articles were rephrased or amended like for instance the word lobbying in paragraph e was replaced by submission of propositions and the phrase to carry out non-governmental ecological expert examinations in paragraph i was reformulated to the effect that the civic committee could carry out ecological expert examination on a voluntary basis according to the applicants on september they submitted the redrafted version of the articles of association in which the department s corrections were only partially accepted the government denied this by letter of september the city department informed the applicants of its refusal to register the civic committee on the ground that its articles had not been drafted in accordance with the domestic law in particular the civic committee s status was not indicated the provision that the civic committee could have representative offices in other cities and towns of ukraine did not correspond to the provision that its activities were to be carried out on the territory of kyiv the articles listed two aims of the organisation instead of one aim and tasks the executive board of the civic committee was entrusted with economic господарські functions while section of the associations of citizens act envisaged that the economic activities of an association could only be carried through separate legal entities which it could establish for that specific purpose and the provisions that the civic committee could carry out publishing activities on its own and involve volunteers in its activities as members were contrary to the same law finally the applicants had not taken into account all the corrections made to the text of the articles of association and they had submitted a copy of the document showing that they had paid registration fees while the original was required in a letter of september received by the city department on september mr koretskyy acting on behalf of the civic committee as its head stated that the department had not taken into account the amended version of the civic committee s articles lodged with it on september he asked the department to reconsider its decision in the light of the amended version of the articles of association the additional copies of which he could submit if the department wished by letter of october the city department acknowledged receipt of the applicants letter of september and referring to its letter of september informed them that the articles of association could not be examined if they had not been re-drafted in compliance with the law the department also informed them that its refusal to register the civic committee could be challenged before the courts the applicants continued to carry out certain activities of the civic committee in particular publishing articles on its behalf in various newspapers on november the applicants lodged a complaint with the pecherskyy district court of kyiv seeking the annulment of the city department s decision not to register the civic committee they alleged a violation of their right to form an association and the right to freely choose its aims and areas of activities they also argued that the reasons for the refusal to register their association had been based on an incorrect interpretation and application of the relevant law by the city department furthermore according to them the city department had failed to take into account the amended version of the articles of association which they annexed to their complaint to the court on march the court rejected the applicants complaint as unsubstantiated on august the kyiv city court of appeal upheld the first-instance court s decision the courts held that the refusal to register the civic committee had been lawful since the articles of association contained textual discrepancies with the relevant provisions of the domestic legislation in particular the aim of the civic committee was not defined correctly and did not correspond to the requirements of sections and of the associations of citizens act the provisions of paragraphs and of the articles of association authorising the executive board of the civic committee to carry out everyday administrative and financial activities and envisaging that the civic committee could perform publishing activities were not in compliance with sections and of that law the wording of paragraphs and of the articles of association as regards the participation of volunteers in the civic committee s activities contravened the principle of equality of members of an association embodied in section of the law the courts

while they were in police custody according to a police officer s decision and an order dated may a state-funded lawyer mr o.a was invited to defend the first applicant similarly according to a police officer s decision and an order dated may a state-funded lawyer mr a.b was invited to defend the second applicant the applicants were brought before the nasimi district court on the day following their arrest according to the applicants the hearing before the first-instance court was very brief in both cases members of the public were not allowed inside the courtroom even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public according to the applicants they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing a state-funded lawyer was invited to defend the first applicant it was the same lawyer mr o.a. who had been invited to defend her in accordance with the above-mentioned police officer s decision of may the second applicant was not represented by a lawyer according to the transcript of the hearing in his case he refused the assistance of the state-funded lawyer and decided to defend himself in person according to the transcript of the hearing concerning the first applicant the state-funded lawyer did not make any oral or written submissions the only witnesses questioned during the hearing concerning the first applicant were police officers who according to official records had arrested her or issued the administrative-offence report on her they testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised protest with respect to the second applicant the court did not question any witness according to the transcript of the hearing concerning the first applicant she stated that she had participated in the protest of may and

judgment against the nida members and had not committed any unlawful action in both cases the nasimi district court found that the applicants had participated in an unauthorised demonstration the court convicted the applicants under article of the cao and sentenced them to a period of administrative detention of thirty and twenty days respectively on unspecified dates the applicants lodged appeals with the baku court of appeal arguing that their convictions had been in violation of their rights because the protest in which they had participated had been spontaneous and peaceful the applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the first-instance court had not been fair they asked the baku court of appeal to quash the firstinstance court s decisions in their respective cases the first applicant was assisted by a lawyer of her own choosing before the baku court of appeal the second applicant was not represented by a lawyer on and may respectively the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeals and upheld the decisions of the firstinstance court at the time of the applicants arrest under article iv of the law on freedom of assembly of november no prior written notification was required for spontaneous assemblies before amendments introduced by law no of november a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was punishable under article of the code of administrative offences of the cao by a reprimand or a fine of seven to thirteen manats azn law no of november which entered into force on january introduced new wording to article of the cao on breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies according to that amendment participation in an assembly organised in breach of such rules became explicitly punishable under article of the cao and punishments in the form of administrative detention of up to days or community service were introduced for the first time in addition the fine for a breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was increased and the amounts fixed as follows between azn and for participants of an assembly azn to azn for individuals who organise an assembly azn to azn for persons in charge vəzifəli şəxslər who organise an assembly and between azn and azn for legal entities involved in the organisation of an assembly a further increase in the penalties for breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies occured in may by law no of may which entered into force on june the administrative detention sentence foreseen in article and article of the cao was increased to up to two months the relevant extracts of resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe the honouring of obligations and commitments by azerbaijan read regrettably there is no political dialogue with the opposition parties outside parliament the assembly is concerned by the restrictive climate for the activities of the extra-parliamentary opposition which complains about limitations imposed on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the lack of access to the public media the establishment of an inclusive political system and a truly competitive and unrestrictive political environment requires full implementation of basic freedoms including freedom of expression freedom of assembly and freedom of association the situation in azerbaijan is preoccupying and the assembly expresses its deep concern in this regard recently adopted amendments to the criminal code and the administrative code which have increased penalties for the organisers of and participants in unauthorised gatherings raise concern considering the authorities ongoing blanket ban on protests in the baku city centre these amendments are likely to have a further negative impact on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression the restrictive use of certain articles of the criminal code in particular articles and against participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised demonstrations is another matter of concern the relevant extracts of report commdh of august by nils muižnieks the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe following his visit to azerbaijan from to may read the commissioner is deeply concerned by the recent amendments to the law on freedom of assembly the criminal code and the code of administrative offences which further erode the right to freedom of assembly the sanctions which can now be imposed coupled with the fact that local authorities have not authorised a single rally in baku city centre in recent years clearly have a chilling effect on the organisation of or participation in demonstrations the commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question provided they do not do anything illegal violent or obscene in the course of it the commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly is imposed for a summary of other relevant provisions concerning administrative proceedings and the organisation and holding of public assemblies and relevant extracts from international documents see the judgment in the case of

the case was referred to the court in accordance with the provisions applicable prior to the entry into force of protocol no to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the european commission of human rights the commission on june article of protocol no and former articles and of the convention it originated in three applications nos and against the republic of turkey lodged with the commission under former article of the convention by three turkish nationals mr feridun yazar mr ahmet karataş and mr i̇brahim aksoy and the people 's labour party halkın emeği partisi the hep the applicants on september the applicants alleged in particular that the dissolution of the hep had infringed their right to freedom of association freedom of thought and freedom of expression that they had been discriminated against on account of the political opinions supported by the hep and that the constitutional court had not given them a public hearing the commission declared the applications admissible on april in its report of march former article of the convention note by the registry the commission 's report is obtainable from the registry it unanimously expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of article of the convention that no separate issue arose under articles and and that it was not necessary to examine separately whether there had been a violation of article it also expressed the opinion by twenty-two votes to four that there had been no violation of article of the convention mr feridun yazar and mr i̇brahim aksoy were represented by mr h. kaplan of the istanbul bar mr ahmet karataş was represented by mr y. alataş of the ankara bar on july a panel of the grand chamber decided that the case should be examined by a chamber rule of the rules of court the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule mr r. türmen the judge elected in respect of withdrew from sitting in the case rule the turkish government the government accordingly appointed mr f. gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge article of the convention and rule the applicants and the government each filed a memorial having consulted the agent of the government and the applicants the chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing rule in fine on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule this case was assigned to the newly composed fourth section rule at the material time the first applicant feridun yazar was chairman of the people 's labour party halkın emeği partisi the hep the second applicant ahmet karataş was its vice-chairman and the third applicant i̇brahim aksoy was its general secretary on june the hep was founded and its constitution was filed with the ministry of the interior on july principal state counsel at the court of cassation applied to the to have the hep dissolved in his application he accused the party of having undermined the integrity of the state he submitted that certain statements made at meetings and to the press by the party 's leaders and senior officials at both central and local level had infringed the constitution and the law on the regulation of political parties he also accused the hep of assisting and protecting those of its members who had committed illegal acts on july the president of the sent principal state counsel 's application to the chairman of the hep inviting him to submit his preliminary observations in reply on september the hep 's lawyer filed his preliminary written observations and requested a hearing in his observations he submitted in particular that the law on the regulation of political parties contained provisions that were contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution he also maintained that the dissolution of the party as called for by principal state counsel would contravene international instruments such as the european convention on human rights the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights the helsinki final act and the charter of paris for a new europe in addition he argued that there was insufficient evidence of the links between the hep and the pkk workers party of kurdistan he further contended that principal state counsel 's application referred to statements made by individuals for which the hep could not be held liable pursuant to section b of the law on the regulation of political parties on january the hep 's lawyer submitted his observations on the merits he again requested a hearing he also sought leave should that request be refused for the hep 's chairman and his predecessors to give evidence to the the acceded to the latter request accordingly the former chairman and the chairman of the hep made oral submissions to the court on march on july the decided to dissolve the hep its judgment was served on principal state counsel the speaker of the national assembly and the prime minister 's office the 's judgment was published in the official gazette on august in its judgment the began by reiterating the main constitutional principles of relevance to the case to the effect that all persons living within turkish territory whatever their ethnic origin formed a whole united by their common culture accordingly the sum of the persons who made up the was called the turkish nation the different ethnic groups making up the nation were therefore not divided into a majority or minorities the pointed out that under the constitution no political or legal distinction based on ethnic or racial origin could be made between citizens all turkish nationals could avail themselves of all civil political and economic rights without discrimination with particular reference to turkish citizens of kurdish origin the held that in every region of these enjoyed the same rights as other turkish citizens that did not mean it added that the constitution did not acknowledge the existence of a kurdish identity since citizens of kurdish origin were not forbidden to express their kurdish identity the kurdish language could be used on all private premises at places of work in the press and in works of art and literature the reiterated the principle that all people were bound to observe the provisions of the constitution even if they did not agree with them the constitution did not preclude the celebration of difference but forbade propaganda that was based on racial difference and was aimed at destroying the constitutional order the pointed out that under the treaty of lausanne having a separate language or ethnic origin was not in itself sufficient for a group to qualify as a minority with regard to the hep 's activities the constitutional court examined in particular the written and oral statements made at public and private meetings by the party 's leaders and by other officials at various levels it also considered the content of calendars on sale to the public and slogans shouted at various meetings held on the hep 's premises the was particularly critical of the hep for seeking to divide the turkish nation in two with turks on one side and kurds on the other with the aim of establishing separate states and for seeking to destroy national and territorial integrity it considered in that connection that the hep was asserting through its activities that there was a separate kurdish people with its own culture and language which the kurds were not free to practise the hep demanded the right to self-determination for the kurds advocated the setting up of kurdish provinces and described the terrorist acts committed by the pkk as acts of international war it regarded pkk terrorists as freedom fighters and claimed that instead of combating them the security forces were in fact seeking to bring about the mass extermination of the kurdish people in all its activities in which the sole emphasis was on equality between turks and kurds the hep was calling for the establishment of a state built on racist foundations thereby jeopardising the concept of the turkish nation one of the principles on which the state had been founded in the constitutional court 's view the hep 's aims resembled those of terrorists and the use of accusatory and aggressive statements based on falsehoods which the hep 's leaders constantly repeated as a form of provocation was likely to promote tolerance of terrorist acts and to justify and encourage their perpetrators the constitutional court concluded that the hep 's activities were subject inter alia to the restrictions referred to in paragraph of article and to the provisions of article of the convention it pointed out in that connection that the charter of paris for a new europe condemned racism ethnic hatred and terrorism and that the helsinki final act guaranteed adherence to the principles of the inviolability of national frontiers and of territorial integrity the accordingly ordered the dissolution of the hep on the ground that its activities were such as to undermine the territorial integrity of the state and the unity of the nation however the dismissed principal state counsel 's second argument that the hep implicitly or explicitly tolerated the illegal actions of its members in that connection it took into account the fact that the various criminal proceedings instituted against members of the hep were still pending and that none of its members had yet been found guilty the main ideas put forward in the hep leaders speeches explanations and statements as outlined in the 's judgment may be summarised as follows a there is a kurdish people in which has its own language and culture and is oppressed b the kurds are not allowed to read or write in kurdish or improve their knowledge of the language and are unable to develop their culture c the kurds are fighting for freedom and democracy a parallel is drawn with the legend of kawa who had revolted against the oppressive king dehhak years ago it is asserted that more and more people are emulating kawa d the kurdish people have the right to self-determination e the kurdish people can not avail themselves of any rights arising from international agreements f the problems in eastern are not of an economic nature g the statutory measures taken against organised terrorism constitute an international war and the armed organisation the pkk is one of the belligerents h the armed militants belonging to that organisation are freedom fighters it is therefore natural that the international laws of war should be applied to them but the turkish government has not put that into practice i the turkish army and the security forces pursue the aim of physically destroying the kurdish masses from which the kurdish militants are drawn rather than fighting them j since the break-up of the the course of history has caused turkish citizens of kurdish origin to take an interest in that phenomenon and a parallel has consequently been drawn with the situation of the palestinian people k the republic has been founded by the turkish and kurdish peoples turks and kurds should establish a social system based on equality between the two ethnic groups without taking any others into account l the government forces stationed in south-eastern have been deployed not against the terrorists but against the kurdish people and have appropriated their national rights m the hep is also the party of the oppressed kurds the workers other oppressed and exploited ethnic groups the arabs the circassians the laz and the albanians n the united nations should hold a conference on the kurdish question as soon as possible o the kurdish problem is the biggest obstacle to democracy until it is solved democracy can not be developed in at the material time the relevant provisions of the constitution read as follows article the is a

the case originated in an application no against romania lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a romanian national mr benieamin manole the first applicant and a group of farmers including the first applicant who had attempted to set up a trade union and had requested its registration in accordance with the procedure prescribed by romanian law the second applicant or the applicant union the applicants were represented by mrs g. perin a lawyer practising in rome the romanian government the government were represented by their agent mrs i. cambrea and then by mrs c. brumar of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicants alleged that the romanian courts refusal to register the applicant union constituted an infringement of freedom of association in breach of article of the convention on december the application was communicated to the government mr benieamin manole the first applicant was born in and lives in priponesti galaţi county by decision of january the first applicant a farmer and forty-eight other persons meeting in constituent assembly decided to form a trade union entitled agricultural trade union romanian farmers direct the first applicant was elected president of the new trade union on january the first applicant applied to the tecuci district court seeking the registration of the trade union which he represented with a view to conferring legal personality on it he enclosed with his request the statutes of the trade union and the relevant authority form presented to him by the constituent assembly as notarised on january according to those statutes the applicant trade union s main purpose was to defend the interests of its members that is to say farmers and persons providing services for farmers including transport facilities the first applicant described that purpose as follows the romanian farmers direct trade union emerged from the desire to help romanian farmers move on from subsistence farming to agriculture as practised in the european union where the production of rural farms is directed towards the market rather than self-sufficiency as is currently the case in our country in order to provide farmers with a decent standard of living our trade union has set itself the aim of organising local centres three or four adjacent municipalities in all the counties of romania with a view to providing legal information accountancy advice and judicial assistance to individual farmers .... we believe that it would be advantageous if as many farmers as possible could come together to think and act in unison in order to ensure the success of our agricultural activities .... by judgment of january the district court sitting in single-judge formation judge n.m. declared the request for registration of the trade union inadmissible on the grounds that only employees persoanele încadrate în muncă and civil servants could set up trade unions on appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant trade union represented by the first applicant that judgment was quashed by decision of galaţi county court on march that court held that the action had been wrongly declared inadmissible and that the district court should have examined the merits of the case by judgment of april the tecuci district court sitting in the same single-judge formation rejected the request as ill-founded on the grounds that under law no on trade unions legea sindicatelor farmers could not set up trade unions but could only join pre-existing unions the applicant trade union lodged an appeal on points of law submitting first of all that the court which had tried the case after invalidation had been the same which had delivered the invalidated judgment of january and secondly that article of the constitution guaranteeing trade union rights had been infringed by decision of may the county court accepted the applicant trade union s appeal on points of law insofar as it concerned the make-up of the first-instance trial court and assessing the merits of the case rejected the trade union s application for the registration of the trade union in doing so the court observed that only employees holding a contract of employment and civil servants could set up trade unions to the exclusion of farmers and other self-employed persons who could only join pre-existing trade unions by a handwritten authority form dated november the first applicant acting in his own name and on behalf of the applicant trade union in his capacity as the latter s representative appointed mrs g. perin counsel to represent them before the court that authority was signed by both the first applicant and mrs g. perin the authority may be

representative of that trade union appoint as counsel to defend our case before the european court of human rights ms giulia perin a lawyer practising in padua italy. the relevant provisions of the revised european social charter the european union s charter of fundamental rights and derived european law are expounded in the judgments in the cases of sindicatul păstorul cel bun no and demir and baykara v. turkey gc no echr the relevant provisions of ilo convention no concerning the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise which was adopted in and ratified by romania on

experts on the application of conventions and recommendations ceacr adopted in and published in concerning the application by romania of convention no concerning the freedom of association and protection of the right to organise read as follows the committee notes however that certain issues previously raised are still pending after the adoption of the social dialogue act .... the committee also notes a number of additional discrepancies between the provisions of the social dialogue act and the convention in terms of scope of application such as self-employed apprentices dismissed or retired workers eligibility conditions for trade union officials restriction of trade union activities etc in this respect the committee notes that the government has recently benefitted from ilo technical assistance seeking to ensure the conformity with the convention of a draft emergency ordinance which substantially amends the social dialogue act the committee trusts that the government will take due account of its comments in the context of this legislative review and that the new legislation will be in full conformity with the convention the committee requests the government to indicate in its next report any developments in this respect. the relevant parts of the global report entitled freedom of association in practice lessons learned global report under the follow-up to the ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work read as follows the ilo supervisory bodies have consistently emphasized that all workers without any distinction and irrespective of their employment status including self-employed workers managerial employees and workers in cooperatives should enjoy the right to establish and join trade unions of their own choosing like all other workers this is all the more important in the case of vulnerable categories of workers for whom the exercise of the right to organize is a way of breaking out of marginalization and poverty nearly half the world s workforce is found in rural areas which remain the largest source of employment in africa and most of asia nevertheless in many countries agricultural and rural workers are still denied the right to organize and bargain collectively this is despite the fact that the need to protect the rights of those working in agriculture was recognized as early as when the ilo s member states adopted the right of association agriculture convention no according to which agricultural workers should have the same ‘ rights of association and combination as industrial workers this convention has been ratified by member states at the same time the practical difficulties of putting into effect the rights to organize and bargain collectively in the sector can not be minimized the agricultural sector and rural employment in general have distinctive features in general agriculture is a sector in which small enterprises with relatively few employees predominate and self-employment is widespread much of the wage employment is temporary or seasonal and farms are spread over wide geographical areas these factors are a challenge to trade union organization the number of agricultural trade union members is usually relatively small compared to the total number of workers in the sector in addition to practical difficulties facing agricultural workers who wish to organize there is also evidence of government interference which restricts the exercise of this basic right the most common legal obstacle in the sector remains the full or partial exclusion of agricultural workers from legislation guaranteeing the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining the relevant provisions of ilo convention no on the right of association agriculture adopted in and ratified by romania on may read as follows each member of the international labour organisation which ratifies this convention undertakes to secure to all those engaged in agriculture the same rights of association and combination as to industrial workers and to repeal any statutory or other provisions restricting such rights in the case of those engaged in agriculture. the relevant provisions of ilo convention no on rural workers organisations and their role in economic and social development which was adopted in and has not been ratified by romania read as follows for the purposes of this convention the term rural workers means any person engaged in agriculture handicrafts or a related occupation in a rural area whether as a wage earner or subject to the provisions of paragraph of this article as a self-employed person such as a tenant sharecropper or small owner-occupier this convention applies only to those tenants sharecroppers or small owner-occupiers who derive their main income from agriculture who work the land themselves with the help only of their family or with the help of occasional outside labour and who do not a permanently employ workers or b employ a substantial number of seasonal workers or c have any land cultivated by sharecroppers or tenants. all categories of rural workers whether they are wage earners or self-employed shall have the right to establish and subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation the principles of freedom of association shall be fully respected rural workers organisations shall be independent and voluntary in character and shall remain free from all interference coercion or repression the acquisition of legal personality by organisations of rural workers shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this article in exercising the rights provided for in this article rural workers and their respective organisations like other persons or organised collectivities shall respect the law of the land the law of the land shall not be such as to impair nor shall it be so applied as to impair the guarantees provided for in this article. ilo convention no has been ratified by states including nineteen member states of the council of europe albania austria belgium cyprus denmark finland france germany greece hungary italy malta republic of moldova the netherlands poland spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom the relevant provisions of recommendation no concerning rural workers organisations and their role in economic and social development adopted by the ilo in read as follows it should be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth on a voluntary basis of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers without discrimination in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom such organisations should as appropriate be able to -- a represent further and defend the interests of rural workers for instance by undertaking negotiations and consultations at all levels on behalf of such workers collectively b represent rural workers in connection with the formulation implementation and evaluation of programmes of rural development and at all stages and levels of national planning f contribute to the improvement of the conditions of work and life of rural workers including occupational safety and health in order to enable organisations of rural workers to play their role in economic and social development member states should adopt and carry out a policy of active encouragement to these organisations particularly with a view to a eliminating obstacles to their establishment their growth and the pursuit of their lawful activities as well as such legislative and administrative discrimination against rural workers organisations and their members as may exist the principles of freedom of association should be fully respected rural workers organisations should be independent and voluntary in character and should remain free from all interference coercion or repression member states should ensure that national laws or regulations do not given the special circumstances of the rural sector inhibit the establishment and growth of rural workers organisations,case originated application romania lodged court

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a moldovan non-governmental organisation genderdoc-m the applicant association on march the applicant association was represented by ms natalia mardari a lawyer practising in chisinau the moldovan government the government were represented by their agent mr vladimir grosu as mr mihai poalelungi the judge elected in respect of moldova had withdrawn from the case rule of the rules of court the president of the chamber appointed mr ján šikuta to sit as an ad hoc judge article of the convention and rule of the rules of court on may the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article third-party comments were received from the international commission of jurists which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the applicant genderdoc-m is a non-governmental organisation based in whose object is to provide information and to assist the lgbt community on april the applicant association applied to chişinău municipal council for authorisation to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of the parliament on may to encourage the adoption of laws to protect sexual minorities from discrimination on april the chişinău municipal council rejected the application on the ground that the applicant association s demonstration was baseless since a law on the protection of national minorities had already been adopted on may the mayor s office also refused permission for the proposed demonstration on the grounds that there was a law on the protection of national minorities already in place and that there were legal provisions which dictated which individuals had the power of legislative initiative required to promote laws the applicant association contested the decision of the chişinău mayor s office of may it argued that the ban on their demonstration was illegal and discriminatory on june the chişinău court of appeal allowed the applicant association s action and declared the chişinău mayor s office decision of may void chişinău court of appeal found the following the court considers legally ungrounded the arguments relied on by the defendant to justify its refusal to authorise the assembly as the law does not provide such grounds for the non-authorisation of an assembly the decision as to whether to authorise or not to authorise an assembly should not be made conditional either on the nature of the problems the participants intend to bring to society s attention or on the status of those problems under these circumstances the court concludes that the decision of the mayor s office dated may was issued contrary to the provisions of article of the law regarding administrative complaints and was thus illegal and void as to the plaintiff s other complaints including the mayor s office s noncompliance with the time-limit of forty-eight hours for notification of the refusal of authorisation for the assembly required under section of the law regarding the organisation and conduct of assemblies the court declares them illfounded. the chişinău mayor s office appealed against the decision of the chişinău court of appeal of june the mayor s office argued that they had received many requests from individuals and associations which were vehemently against the authorisation of the demonstration and who opposed the adoption of any law legalising homosexual partnerships the requests had laid emphasis on various legal provisions that concerned the protection of marriage and the family on september the supreme court of justice allowed the appeal lodged by the mayor s office quashed the chişinău court of appeal decision of june and decided to send the case to the court of appeal for re-examination in their submissions to the court of appeal the mayor s office argued that the holding of an assembly for the promotion of the rights of sexual minorities would endanger public order and social morality and moreover that the organisers had not assumed any responsibility as regards the demonstration s good management the applicant association argued that the ban was illegal and discriminatory on june the court of appeal found against the applicant association the applicant association appealed against this decision on october the supreme court of justice upheld the decision of the court of appeal of june it found that the applicant association had failed to give undertakings as regards a number of obligations required by the law in respect of assemblies such as to respect the law to designate a person or persons in charge of the conduct of the demonstration to create together with the police a group of people responsible for the maintenance of public order to mark the site of the demonstration with special signs to pay the municipal council any fees related to the arrangement of the site of the demonstration to establish the route to and from the site of the demonstration to provide the police with unfettered access to the site of the demonstration and to forbid the participation of certain persons moreover the court considered that there was a risk that the demonstration would cause a breach of public order law no of july regarding the organisation and conduct of assemblies provides as relevant the following section notification of assemblies assemblies may be held only after the organisers have duly notified the urban mayor s municipal or rural offices section preliminary notification the organiser of an assembly must lodge a notification with the mayor s office at least fifteen days before the chosen date according to the model provided in the appendix which is part of the present law the preliminary notification should indicate a the name of the organiser the aim of the assembly b the date and time the assembly is to begin and end c where the assembly will take place and the routes to and from the place d the form the assembly will take e the approximate number of participants f those appointed to ensure the good conduct of the assembly and to be responsible for it g the services the organisers require from the mayor s office the mayor s office may in justified cases modify with the organiser s consent elements of the preliminary notification section after examining the preliminary declaration the mayor s office shall issue one of the following decisions and inform the organiser about it a grant permission b refuse permission under section section the organiser can contest the refuse to authorise an assembly the relevant judicial body shall decide upon the organiser s contestation within days from its lodging. section of law no of march regarding local public administration provides that the mayor undertakes the following functions over administered territory in the field of legal order f undertakes legal measures regarding the conduct of public assemblies g undertakes measures forbidding or suspending shows presentations and other public demonstrations which contradict legal order and morals. the moldovan constitution contains the following relevant provisions article restricting the exercise of certain rights or freedoms the exercise of certain rights or freedoms may be restricted only under the law and only as required for the defence of national security of public order health or morals of citizens rights and freedoms the carrying out of investigations in criminal cases the prevention of the consequences of a natural calamity or of a technological disaster the restrictions enforced must be in proportion to the situation that caused them and may not affect the existence of that right or liberty. the moldovan civil code stipulates in article an association is a non-commercial organisation established voluntarily by associated individuals and legal entities under provisions of the law on the basis of community of interests which are consistent with public order and good morals for the purpose of meeting various non-material needs. declares the application admissible unanimously holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article of the convention holds unanimously that there has been a violation of article in conjunction with article of the convention holds by five votes to two that there has been a violation of article in conjunction with article of the convention holds unanimously that there is no need to examine separately article and article of the convention holds by six votes to one a that the respondent state is to pay the applicant association within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with article of the convention the following amounts to be converted into moldovan lei at the rate applicable on the date of settlement b that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the european central bank during the default period plus three percentage points done in english and notified in writing on june pursuant to rule and of the rules of court in accordance with article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the separate opinions of judges myjer gyulumyan and ziemele are annexed to this judgment i voted with the majority in finding a violation of article in conjunction with article still i am not convinced by the underlying reasoning laid down in the judgment what happened in this case the applicant in applied for authorisation to hold a peaceful demonstration in front of the parliament to encourage the passing of laws to protect sexual minorities the authorisation was not given the official reason for this refusal was that the demonstration was baseless since a law on national minorities had already been passed see paragraphs and of the judgment interestingly later on when the applicant appealed all of a sudden other totally new reasons were put forward by the authorities the mayor s office had received many requests from individuals and associations who were vehemently against the authorisation of the demonstration and who opposed the passing of any law legalising homosexual relationships see paragraph the holding of an assembly for the promotion of the rights of sexual minorities would endanger public order and social morality and moreover the organisers had not assumed any responsibility as regards the demonstration s good management see paragraph if the authorities had stuck to the initial reasons given and no other evidence had been available it would have been hard for the court to establish discrimination provided that the authorities meant to include sexual minorities among national minorities owing to the fact that the authorities chose to invent and put forward new reasons the authorities themselves provided the underlying material to enable the court to establish a discriminatory intent looking at the different reasons and the sequence in which they were given one can now safely deduce that the first reasons given were only designed to cover up the real reasoning behind the refusal the same applies to the last reasons given it would be totally unrealistic to accept that the permission was initially refused because the organisers had not assumed any responsibility as regards the demonstration s good management admittedly the supreme court in its decision of october paid much attention to this new line of reasoning but if that had been the real reason behind the refusal it should have been put forward right at the beginning and again if that had been the case it would have been hard for the court to establish an intent to discriminate that leaves us with the simple conclusion that the refusal must have had to do with a reason which the authorities did not dare to mention and the only logical reason which is left is they did not give authorisation because apparently they did not want a demonstration which had to do with the rights of sexual minorities/homosexuals is it fair to draw that conclusion yes in the circumstances of the case this is possible the first new line of reasoning as referred to in paragraph is sufficiently conclusive in this regard maybe the authorities did in fact refuse the authorisation because of as the majority put it their disapproval of demonstrations which they considered to promote homosexuality see paragraph of the judgment however i wonder where the majority find any indication that a proposed demonstration to encourage the passing of laws to protect sexual minorities was also intended to promote homosexuality as such or that the authorities considered that the demonstration would promote homosexuality we do not share the view of the majority regarding the violation of article in conjunction with article as set out in their reasoning the majority base their view on two main grounds first they find that the government have not convincingly proved their allegation that there was a systemic problem concerning the exercise of freedom of assembly the government claimed that assemblies were not allowed in general whereas the applicant association showed that some assemblies had in fact been allowed the majority consider that this fact indicates a difference in treatment in relation to the applicant association second the majority find that the arguments of the chişinău mayor s office in the court proceedings were of a discriminatory character the majority also state that all the relevant levels of authority provided different reasons this is one possible way of reading the arguments of the parties in the case there is however another way of interpreting these arguments for example the statement by the mayor s office that it had received protest letters from numerous moldovan citizens asking it to prohibit the gay parade is most likely true the fact that the mayor s office brought this fact to the attention of the national courts per se does not confirm that it adopted a discriminatory attitude or for that matter that the national courts agreed or disagreed with its request in the final instance the national courts mentioned two grounds for their decision to uphold the ban imposed by the mayor s office the first ground was the danger to public order and morality and the second ground was that the organisers had not complied with the prescription of the law requiring them to accept responsibility for the event these reasons in themselves are neither discriminatory nor unreasonable the fact that two different compositions of the same court might disagree on the outcome of the case is not arbitrary in itself either what should have been the test to be applied in this case the majority correctly refer to the principles developed in kozak v. poland no march in which the court said that where a difference in treatment was based solely on sexual orientation it constituted a violation of the convention in view of this criterion the majority should have assessed whether the applicant association s assembly was banned solely on this ground as compared to the other bans of assemblies that the government referred to in relation to which the court has had the opportunity to render several judgments regarding the same period of time the government argued that there was a general atmosphere of intolerance towards different views at the time in it certainly can not be said that the applicant association was the only group whose right to assembly was restricted contrast oršuš and others v. croatia gc no echr there may indeed be some truth in what the government stated about the rather intolerant political situation in the country at the time the court s case-law under article requires a detailed analysis of whether a difference in treatment is discriminatory if we assume that the applicant association was treated differently from others such a difference in treatment will amount to discrimination if it has no objective and reasonable justification that is if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised see among many other authorities larkos v. cyprus gc no echr stec and others v. the united kingdom gc no echr and d.h. and others v. the czech republic gc no echr where the difference in treatment is based on race colour or ethnic origin the notion of objective and reasonable justification must be interpreted as strictly as possible see sampanis and others v. greece no june we might add that in view of the kozak case cited above sexual orientation should be added to this list as far as we can see there were reasonable arguments submitted by the government in explaining the actions of the authorities see paragraph of the judgment the crux of the matter really lies in an assessment of the proportionality of the difference in treatment as compared to other possible assemblies that were or were not allowed for the same reasons of public order this analysis is missing there is an all too easy assumption that the decisions of the national authorities were discriminatory as we said this might well be true but in a judicial decision something more is needed to come to that

the case originated in an application no against the republic of turkey lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by tüm haber sen a trade union and a turkish national mr i̇smail çınar the applicants on august the applicants were represented by mr d. selimoğlu a lawyer practising in the turkish government the government were represented by their agent the applicants alleged in particular that the dissolution of tüm haber sen and the enforced cessation of its activities had infringed their right to freedom of association guaranteed under article of the convention the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule by a decision of november the chamber declared the application partly admissible on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule this case was assigned to the newly composed second section rule tüm haber sen is a trade union now dissolved which was active between and the application was lodged by its former president i̇smail çınar a turkish national who was born in and lives in on january tüm haber sen was formed when its founding document was lodged with the istanbul governor 's office in application of article of the constitution its statutes referred inter alia to the right to conclude collective-bargaining agreements the founders of tüm haber sen were public-sector contractual staff working in the communications field in particular for the post office ptt and the telecommunications service türk telecom when it was dissolved the trade union had members and local branches on january the istanbul governor 's office applied to the şişli public prosecutor 's office seeking the suspension of tüm haber sen 's activities and the trade union 's dissolution on the ground that state employees could not form trade unions it referred in its complaint to article of the constitution section of the trade union act law no and sections and of the state employees act law no in a notice of february the principal public prosecutor called on the fourth civil division of the şişli district court to suspend the trade union 's activities and to order its dissolution on the ground that under the positive law state employees who were subject to law no were not entitled to form trade unions in their written observations submitted to the district court on march the trade union 's representatives argued that the legal provisions in force did not expressly prohibit the formation of trade unions by civil servants and that an obstacle to the exercise of trade-union rights would be in breach of turkey 's international commitments as a signatory to the european convention on human rights the conventions of the international labour organisation and the european social charter on december the district court suspended the trade union 's activities and ordered that it be dissolved the trade union 's representatives appealed to the court of cassation on february the court of cassation quashed the district court 's judgment and referred the case back to it in its reasoning it stated that the fact that the words trade union appeared in the association 's title did not make it a trade union in the technical sense namely that it would be authorised to call strikes and to enter into collective agreements at the most the association could be considered as a professional organisation which aimed to protect the interests of its members who worked in a specified sector before the district court the representatives of tüm haber sen argued that it ought to be considered as a trade union which was authorised to call strikes and to enter into collective agreements on november the district court having examined the arguments submitted by the trade union 's representatives upheld its initial judgment the trade union 's representatives again submitted an appeal on points of law in a judgment of may the court of cassation sitting as a full court and ruling at last instance ordered the dissolution of tüm haber sen it considered that implementation of the right to form trade unions as set out in the constitution required the enactment of a general principles act in the absence of any statutory provisions governing the legal status of trade unions for civil servants or public-sector contractual workers the applicant trade union could not claim to have any legal status nor could it be considered as an association or as some form of professional organisation since its leaders expressly presented it as a full trade union in spite of turkey 's ratification of international labour conventions nos on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise and on protection of the right to organise and the procedures for determining the conditions of employment in the civil service on july the court of cassation sitting as a full court considered that the trade union could not rely on the conventions in question since they were not directly applicable in domestic law and the legislature had not yet enacted implementing legislation the judgment was served on the trade union 's representatives on june between june and august all of tüm haber sen 's branches and sections were dissolved on the orders of the ministry of the interior the relevant provisions of the constitution read as follows article prior to the amendment of october workers and employers have the right to form trade unions and employers associations and federations of unions without prior permission in order to safeguard and develop their economic and social rights and

the case originated in two applications nos and against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by forty-one russian nationals the applicants whose names and dates of birth are listed in the annex on january and february the russian government the government were represented by ms v. milinchuk former representative of the russian federation at the european court of human rights the applicants complained in particular of the belated enforcement of judgments in their favour and of a breach of their right to freedom of assembly on september the applications were communicated to the government the applicants live in vladikavkaz the applicants are former policemen they were all involved in the conflict-resolution and peace-keeping operation in the zone of the armed ossetian-ingush conflict in october and november as a consequence they were entitled to certain social payments the applicants sued the severnaya osetiya-alaniya regional department of the ministry of internal affairs hereafter the regional internal-affairs department for social-payments arrears on various dates in or the leninskiy district court of vladikavkaz allowed their claims and ordered that the regional internal-affairs department pay the arrears the dates of the judgments and the amounts of the awards are listed in the annex the applicants submitted the writs of execution to the ministry of finance however the ministry returned the writs of execution on the ground of lack of funds to pay the judgment debts the judgments in favour of all the applicants were eventually enforced between september and april the dates of payment in respect of each applicant are listed in the annex all the applicants except mr varziev sued the regional internal-affairs department for pecuniary damage incurred through the belated enforcement of the judgments in their favour on various dates in the leninskiy district court of vladikavkaz acknowledged that the delays in enforcement had violated the applicants rights and awarded each of them a sum to cover inflation losses sustained as a result the awards were paid on various dates in one of the applicants mr tsallagov did not submit the writ of execution to the ministry of finance and did not therefore receive his award on september the applicants notified the vladikavkaz town administration of their intention to hold a demonstration in svoboda square in vladikavkaz to protest against the regional internal-affairs department s failure to settle the social-payments debt the demonstration was scheduled to start on september and was announced as being of unlimited duration on september the town administration refused to approve the venue and suggested that the demonstration be held in front of the tkhapsayev theatre on september the applicants began their demonstration in svoboda square in front of the severnaya osetiya-alaniya regional government building about one hundred people participated in it they put up tents and remained in the square day and night they displayed placards and banners stating their criticisms and demands on october the vladikavkaz town legislature annulled the decision of september at the request of the regional internal-affairs department in connection with a risk of terrorist acts in the places of mass gatherings of people it asked the regional internal-affairs department to take measures to break up the demonstration and restore public order in svoboda square on october the leninskiy district court of vladikavkaz declared the demonstration unlawful because it violated the rights of others the court found that it hampered citizens access to public transport and to the cinema and officials access to the administrative buildings situated in svoboda square the chanting of slogans by the applicants also disturbed the officials work moreover the regional internal-affairs department had information about an expected outbreak of terrorist activities in the region the mass gathering of people in the vicinity of the administrative buildings increased the risk of terrorist acts and other offences being committed and impeded the conduct of preventive operations by the law-enforcement agencies the court further noted that the vladikavkaz town administration had ordered that all meetings and assemblies be held in front of the tkhapsayev theatre therefore the demonstration in svoboda square was in breach of that order lastly the court found that public gatherings of unlimited duration were not authorised by russian law it appears from the videotape and press articles submitted by the applicants that on the same day the police ordered the protesters to disperse as the protesters refused to stop the demonstration the police dismantled the tents they had erected the protesters however put the tents back up and continued their demonstration on november the supreme court of the severnaya osetiya-alaniya republic upheld the judgment of october on appeal on november the parliament of the severnaya osetiya-alaniya republic

of vladikavkaz other public gatherings were to be held at a venue to be determined by the vladikavkaz town administration on an unspecified date in december the protesters ended the demonstration for

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the republican party of russia the applicant on february the applicant was represented by mr a. semenov a lawyer practising in the russian government the government were represented by ms v. milinchuk former representative of the at the european court of human rights the applicant alleged in particular a violation of its right to freedom of association on september the president of the first section decided to communicate the above complaint to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits of the application having examined the government s objection the court dismissed it the republican party of russia was created in november by consolidation of the democratic wing of the ussr communist party and its subsequent secession from that party on march the ministry of justice formally registered the public association republican party of the following changes in domestic legislation on april a general conference of the public association decided on its reorganisation into a political party by the name of republican party of russia on august the applicant was registered as a party by the ministry of justice its articles of association list among its aims the nomination of candidates for election to state and municipal bodies and participation in the activities of those bodies the development of civil society in and the promotion of the unity and territorial integrity of the country and of the peaceful coexistence of its multi-ethnic population on december an extraordinary general conference of the applicant elected its management bodies in particular mr zubov was elected chairman of the political council and mr sheshenin chairman of the executive committee in accordance with the articles of association they became ex officio representatives of the party the general conference also decided to change the party s address and to create several regional branches on december the applicant asked the ministry of justice to amend the information contained in the unified state register of legal entities in particular it asked that its new address and the names of its ex officio representatives be entered in the register on january the ministry of justice refused to make the amendments because the party had not submitted documents showing that the general conference had been held in accordance with the law and with its articles of association on march the applicant re-submitted its request it produced the minutes of the conferences of its regional branches at which delegates to the general conference had been nominated the list of the delegates and the minutes of the general conference on april the ministry of justice refused for the second time to register the amendments it found that the applicant had not submitted documents confirming the number of its members moreover the minutes of the irkutsk chelyabinsk and regional conferences did not include the lists of participants the minutes of the arkhangelsk and yaroslavl regional conferences were flawed because they indicated that those conferences had been convened at the initiative of the regional branch the regional conference had not actually been held some of the participants at the general conference were not members of the party or had not been elected delegates due to those and other omissions it was not possible to establish whether the regional conferences had been quorate and whether the general conference had been legitimate the applicant challenged the refusal before a court it argued that it was not required to submit documents confirming the number of its members in any event that information was already in the ministry s possession because the party had submitted it in its annual activity report in the ministry of justice was not empowered to verify whether the general conference and the regional conferences were legitimate domestic law required that such verification be conducted only before the registration of a new party or of amendments to the articles of association which was not the case of the applicant in any event the general conference had been convened in accordance with domestic law and the articles of association it had brought together delegates from regional branches the delegates had been nominated at regional conferences held in compliance with the party s internal rules the law did not require the minutes of regional conferences to contain the list of participants the minutes had indicated the total number of the members of the regional branches and the number of participants at the conferences that information had been sufficient to establish that the conferences had been quorate the applicant conceded that the minutes of the arkhangelsk and regional conferences contained typing errors which however did not affect the outcome of the voting the ministry of justice s finding that the regional conference had never been held had been refuted by the documents the finding that some of the participants at the general conference had not been members of the party or had not been elected delegates was not supported by any documentary evidence the applicant lastly submitted that officials of the regional departments of the ministry of justice who had attended some of the regional conferences had not noted any breaches of the substantive or procedural rules the applicant claimed that the refusal to amend the register violated its freedom of association and hindered its activities in particular the ministry of justice had refused to register three regional branches precisely because the register did not contain the names of the applicant s ex officio representatives the ministry of justice maintained that the decision of april had been lawful the ministry was not only entitled but had a legal obligation to verify the information submitted by the applicant the verification had revealed that the documents produced by the applicant had not met the legal requirements in particular the minutes of the regional conferences did not all contain the list of participants thirty-three regional conferences had been inquorate the applicant had never submitted any information about its local branches and it was therefore not clear who had nominated delegates for the regional conferences and whose interests they had represented the minutes of the arkhangelsk and yaroslavl regional conferences indicated that the conferences had been convened at the initiative of the regional branch due to those omissions it had not been possible to establish whether the delegates to the general conference had been duly nominated moreover the decision to convene the general conference had been taken on december while some of the regional conferences had taken place in november as the general conference had been convened in breach of the procedural rules it had been illegitimate on september the taganskiy district court of moscow upheld the decision of april it held that under sections and of the political parties act the ministry of justice had been empowered to verify the information and documents submitted by the applicant before registering any amendments to the register the ministry had found that the documents submitted did not meet the requirements established by law the court had no reason to doubt its findings because they were corroborated by the case materials and had not been refuted by the applicant the court held that the decision of april had been lawful and had not violated the applicant s rights under article of the convention in its appeal submissions the applicant claimed in particular that the ministry of justice s requirement to submit the same documents as for the initial registration of a party or the registration of amendments to its articles of association had no basis in domestic law under the political parties act amendments concerning a party s address or the names of its ex officio representatives were to be registered on the basis of a written notification to the registration authority the applicant also argued that the ministry of justice had no authority to verify the legitimacy of its general conference it insisted that the general conference had been held in conformity with its articles of association and with domestic law on december the moscow city court upheld the judgment on appeal it referred to section of the non-profit organisations act and held as follows a political party requesting to amend the information contained in the register is to produce the same documents as required for registration of a party the list of those documents is contained in section of the political parties act the applicant s argument that the extraordinary general conference of the party was organised and held in accordance with the law in force and with its articles of association aims at a different assessment of documents produced by the applicant to the ministry of justice for registration at the same time the ministry of justice and the district court had reasons to conclude that the submitted documents contained information which did not meet the legal requirements the city court agrees with the district court s assessment of the evidence. in in a separate set of proceedings the ministry of justice conducted an inspection of the applicant s activities it issued thirty-six warnings to the party s regional branches seven regional branches were dissolved by courts at the ministry s request and the activities of the regional branch were suspended on september the ministry prepared the inspection report mentioning that the applicant had regional branches of which had more than members and that the total number of party members was on march the ministry of justice asked the supreme court of the to dissolve the applicant it claimed that the party had fewer than members and fewer than regional branches with more than members in breach of the political parties act the applicant submitted that it met the requirements of the political parties act because it had members and had registered regional branches with more than members on march the supreme court of the ordered the dissolution of the applicant it found that the mari-el krasnoyarsk tyumen novosibirsk murmansk and regional branches had been dissolved by court decisions in therefore their members could not be taken into account eight regional branches had fewer than members in particular despite a warning issued by the ministry the ingushetia regional branch did not submit documents showing the number of its members according to the information in the ministry of justice s possession the branch had members the applicant had submitted that the kalmykiya regional branch had members however an inspection had revealed that thirty-seven of them had never joined the party four of them were simultaneously members of other regional branches the names of three members appeared twice in the list and eighteen members did not reside at the indicated addresses therefore the branch had in fact only members out of members of the krasnodar regional branch eighteen had made a written declaration that they had never joined the party four members while refusing to make a written statement had made oral statements to that effect the regional branch had members however seventeen of them were under eighteen years of age moreover the party had not produced individual applications for membership in respect of members members of the samara regional branch had been admitted to the party in breach of the articles of association in particular members had been admitted by the branch s political council elected at an illegitimate general conference to support its conclusion that the general conference had been illegitimate the supreme court referred to the judgment of the taganskiy district court of moscow of september see paragraph above the regional branch had members however the membership of of them had not been confirmed in particular the party had not produced individual applications for membership in respect of members thirty-three members had no residence registration in the tambov region four members had left the tambov region two members had been younger than eighteen at the time they had joined the party three members had not signed their applications for membership and thirty-three had declared that they had never joined the party the tula regional branch had members the komi-permyatskiy regional branch had members the court held that it had no reason to doubt the information submitted by the ministry the applicant had never contested before the courts the information contained in the inspection report or the warnings issued by the ministry the court further found that the ministry had not submitted any evidence in support of their conclusions that the karachaevo-cherkesskiy altay and regional branches had fewer than members therefore the court accepted the number of members suggested by the applicant the court also accepted that the party had several unregistered branches however their members could not be taken into account for establishing the total number of party members the court concluded that on january the applicant had members and regional branches with more than members thus the applicant did not meet the requirements established by law and was subject to dissolution the applicant appealed it submitted that the ministry s submissions had not been supported by any documents nor had the ministry indicated the names of the people who in its opinion had been admitted to the party in breach of domestic law and the party s articles of association the first-instance court had refused to admit evidence submitted by the applicant namely individual applications for membership and other documents confirming the number of party members the court had not taken into account members living in the regions where the branches were not registered although they had been admitted to the party at the federal level and were members of the party itself and not members of its unregistered regional branches the ministry had conducted an inspection in march it had never verified the number of the applicant s members as at january moreover its seven regional branches had been dissolved later in therefore on january they had still been functioning and the applicant had had the required number of regional branches lastly as domestic law did not establish the inspection procedure the inspections had been arbitrary on may the appellate collegium of the supreme court upheld the judgment of march on appeal it found that the findings of the first-instance court had been based on sufficient evidence namely the inspection reports compiled by the ministry of justice and its regional departments the court had taken into account the number of the party s members as at january individual applications submitted by the party after that date could not be taken into account because they could have been written after january and backdated moreover the applicant had not challenged the inspection report or the warnings issued by the ministry it was accordingly barred from contesting before the supreme court the facts mentioned in the report and in the warnings in any event even according to the party s submissions it had only regional branches with more than members instead of which was in itself a sufficient ground for dissolution the status and activities of political parties are governed by the political parties act federal law no of july the non-profit organisations act federal law no of january and the registration of legal entities act federal law no of august membership of a political party shall be voluntary and individual citizens of the who have attained the age of eighteen may be members of a political party foreign citizens stateless persons and russian nationals who have been declared incapable by a judicial decision may not be members of a political party admission to membership of a political party is decided upon on the basis of a written application by the citizen in accordance with the procedure set out in the articles of association a citizen may hold membership of only one political party at once a member of a political party may be registered only in one regional branch in the region of his permanent or predominant residence section and of the political parties act the political parties act adopted on july introduced the requirements of minimum membership and regional representation for political parties until december section of the political parties act required that a political party should have no fewer than ten thousand members and should have regional branches with no fewer than one hundred members in more than one half of russia s regions if those conditions were fulfilled it was also allowed to have branches in the remaining regions provided that each branch had no fewer than fifty members on october a group of deputies of the state duma proposed amendments to section of the political parties act in particular they proposed increasing the minimum membership of a political party to fifty thousand members and the minimum membership of a regional branch to five hundred members an explanatory note appended to the draft law provided the following justification for the amendments the proposed draft federal law is a follow-up to the reform of the political system started in and it aims at strengthening the political parties and involving a wider range of citizens in the political life of the society and the state. the state duma s committee on public associations and religious organisations recommended that the amendments be adopted the recommendation reads as follows the subject of the proposed draft law is extremely important and pertinent the experience of political party development in recent years has revealed that the political system in needs perfection the state and development of the party system have a major influence on the effective functioning of the legislative and executive powers whose mission is to protect citizens rights and create favourable conditions for the development of the country this is the rationale of the political reform proposed by the president of the russian federation which advocates as one of its main goals the enhancement of the role and prestige of political parties in contemporary acting as the nexus between civil society and the authorities and participating in parliamentary elections large and authoritative political parties with firm political views supported by a large number of voters reinforce the structure and stability of the party system this draft law proposes increasing the minimum membership of a party from ten thousand under the law now in force to fifty thousand members and for the regional branches from one hundred to five hundred members this is mainly justified by the consideration that the parliamentary and consequently democratic system can not function without strong parties many small parties the so-called quasi parties having virtually no political weight or influence on the voters take part in the elections and enjoy various advantages during the election campaign they receive financing from the state budget have access to the media and are allocated free airtime on television and after the election they disappear from the political scene it is enough to note that out of forty-four parties and political alliances registered at the moment only three parties and one political alliance have seats in the state duma only three parties have passed the threshold while the others have obtained less than of the votes this situation places an excessive burden on the budget and is at variance with the principle of efficient and careful spending of public funds provided for in article of the budget code of the the dispersal of voters between such small parties results in the instability of the political system which we are witnessing today in our country on the whole the draft law aims at streamlining the existing political system and creating effective large-scale political parties having stable branches in the regions expressing the genuine interests of substantial groups of voters and capable of defending them in the present conditions of democratic transformations in russia in view of the above the committee considers it necessary to support the proposed draft law. on december section was amended the amended section required that a political party should have no fewer than fifty thousand members and should have regional branches with no fewer than five hundred members in more than one half of russia s regions it was also allowed to have branches in the remaining regions provided that each branch had no fewer than two hundred and fifty members the political parties were required to bring the number of their members into compliance with the amended section by january if a party had not complied with that requirement it had to reorganise itself into a public association within a year failing which it would be dissolved section and of the amending act federal law no of december on january the ministry of justice announced that only seventeen political parties out of forty-eight registered as at february now met the requirements of minimum membership and regional representation twelve political parties were dissolved by the supreme court in three political parties reorganised themselves into public associations while several more political parties merged with bigger parties fifteen political parties remained registered by the end of and were eligible to participate in the december elections to the state duma on november the president in his address to the federation council called for the development of democracy in particular by decreasing the minimum membership requirement for political parties on december the president proposed amending section of the political parties act by providing for a gradual decrease in the minimum membership requirement the explanatory note contained the following justification for the proposed amendments the draft law aims at giving effect to the president s address to the federation council of the federal assembly of the russian federation of november concerning the necessity gradually to decrease the minimum membership of political parties required for their registration and further functioning as well as to introduce the requirement of rotation for management bodies of political parties. the state duma s committee on constitutional legislation and state development recommended that the proposed amendments be adopted the relevant part of its recommendation reads as follows the draft law proposes a gradual decrease in the minimum membership of political parties required for their establishment registration and further functioning its aim is to give effect to the measures proposed by the president of the russian federation in his address to the federation council of the of november with a view to increasing the level and quality of people s representation in the government. on april section was amended it now reads as follows a political party shall before january

parties activities with the regulations aims and purposes set out in their articles of association the authorities concerned have the right to study on an annual basis the documents of political parties and their regional branches confirming the existence of regional branches and the number of their members and to issue warnings to political parties and their regional branches if they pursue activities incompatible with their articles of association the party or regional branch may challenge such warnings before a court the authorities have the right to apply to a court for the suspension of the activities or the dissolution of a political party or its regional branch section a political party may be dissolved by the supreme court of the russian federation if it does not comply with the minimum membership requirement or the requirement to have regional branches in more than one half of russian regions section the constitution of the russian federation provides for the multiparty system article and for the right to freedom of association and freedom of activities of public associations article it does not however specify the territorial level all-russian interregional regional or local on which political parties may be founded similarly it does not contain an explicit ban on the creation of regional parties accordingly the requirement in section of the political parties act that political parties may be created and operated only on the federal all-russian level is a limitation of the constitutional right to freedom of association in political parties such limitations are permissible only if they are necessary in order to protect constitutionally guaranteed values article of the constitution of the the political parties act guarantees the right to freedom of association in political parties section and provides that political parties are established for the purpose of ensuring participation by russian citizens in the political life of their society their mission is to form and articulate citizens political will to take part in public and political actions elections and referenda as well as to represent citizens interests in state and municipal bodies section according to the substance of the political parties act political parties are created to ensure russian citizens participation in the political life of the entire rather than in one of its parts their vocation is to form the political will of the multinational russian people as a whole and to articulate nationwide interests first and foremost their aims should not be associated with the interests of certain regions only at the same time when carrying out their activities directly in the regions political parties must combine nationwide and regional interests the federal legislator made the acquisition and retention of the status of a political party conditional firstly on a public association expressing the interests of a considerable number of citizens irrespective of their region of residence and secondly on its carrying out activities in the entire territory of the russian federation or most of it such structuring of the political scene is aimed at preventing the division of the political forces and the emergence of numerous artificial small parties especially during electoral campaigns created for a short duration and therefore incapable of fulfilling their mission in the country s political system in the contemporary conditions where russian society has not yet acquired solid experience of democratic existence and is faced with serious challenges from separatist nationalist and terrorist forces the creation of regional political parties which would inevitably be interested in vindicating mainly their own purely regional or local interests might result in a breach of the territorial integrity and unity of the political system and undermine the federative structure of the country the legal line between regional political parties and political parties based in fact on ethnic or religious affiliation would be blurred such parties would inevitably strive to assert mainly the rights of their respective ethnic and religious communities which at the present stage of historic development would distort the process of forming and articulating the political will of the multinational people which is the bearer of sovereignty and the only source of power in the moreover taking into account the complex federal structure of the the establishment of regional and local political parties in each region of the federation might lead to the rise of numerous regional party systems this might turn the emerging party system into a destabilising factor for the developing russian democracy popular sovereignty federalism and the unity of the country and weaken the constitutional protection of people s rights and freedoms including the right to freedom of association in political parties and the equal right of all citizens to establish a political party and participate in its activities in the entire territory of the russian federation thus the requirement contained in the political parties act that the status of a political party may be acquired only by nationwide all-russian public associations pursues such constitutionally protected aims as the creation of a real multiparty system the legal institutionalisation of political parties in order to assist the development of the civil society and the formation of large nationwide political parties this requirement is also necessary in the contemporary historical conditions of developing democracy and rule of law in the russian federation for the purpose of protecting constitutional values and above all securing the unity of the country the above limitation is temporary in character and must be abolished as soon as the circumstances justifying it become different although it provides for a multiparty system and guarantees the right to freedom of association in political parties and the freedom of their activities the constitution of the does not set any requirements concerning the number of parties or any membership requirements nor does it prohibit establishing a minimum membership requirement for political parties it is the role of the federal lawmaker to establish those requirements in such a way that on the one hand the required minimum membership and territorial scale of activities of political parties are not excessive and do not encroach on the very essence of the citizens right to freedom of association and on the other hand the political parties are capable of fulfilling their aims and mission as nationwide all-russian political parties in other words the lawmaker must be guided by the criteria of reasonable sufficiency ensuing from the principle of proportionality when deciding on the minimum membership and the territorial scale of the activities of political parties the lawmaker has a wide discretion taking into account that this issue is to a considerable degree based on political expediency this follows from the fact that there exist different solutions to the issue in the legislation of other countries the minimum membership requirement for political parties is considerably higher or lower than that contained in section of the political parties act defining the minimum-membership requirement for political parties in the political parties act the lawmaker apparently proceeded from the necessity for a political party to have considerable support in society such support is required to fulfil the main mission of a political party in a democratic society namely forming and articulating the political will of the people the requirements such as contained in section of the political parties act as in force until december are not in themselves incompatible with the constitution of the these quantitative requirements might become incompatible with the constitution if their enforcement results in the practical impossibility for the citizens to exercise their constitutional right to freedom of association in political parties for example if in breach of the constitutional principle of the multiparty system they permit the establishment of one party only the principle of political pluralism guaranteed by article of the constitution of the may be implemented not only through a multiparty system and establishment and the activities of political parties with various ideologies therefore the forfeiture by interregional regional and local public associations of the right to be called a political party does not mean that such associations are deprived of the right to participate in the political life of society at the regional and local levels nor have their members been deprived of the right to freedom of association public associations have the majority of the rights guaranteed to political parties the provision of the political parties act that a political party is the only kind of public association that may nominate candidates in elections to state bodies section does not mean that other public associations including regional and local ones are deprived of the right to nominate candidates for elections to municipal bodies or the right to initiate regional or local referenda it follows from the above that taking into account the historical conditions of development of the russian federation as a democratic and federative state governed by the rule of law sections and of the political parties act setting out the requirements for political parties and providing for the forfeiture by interregional regional and local public associations of the status of political parties can not be considered as imposing excessive limitations on the right to freedom of association the above requirements do not prevent citizens of the russian federation from exercising their constitutional right to freedom of association by creating all-russian political parties or joining them or from defending their interests and achieving their collective goals in the political sphere at the interregional regional and local levels by creating public associations and joining them the aim of the minimum membership requirement is to promote the consolidation process to create prerequisites for the establishment of large political parties voicing the real interests of the social strata and to secure fair and equal competition between political parties during elections to the state duma the federal law of may the state duma elections act reformed the electoral system in accordance with that law all members of the state duma are to be elected from electoral lists submitted by political parties the seats in the state duma are distributed between the political parties which pass the threshold of in terms of the number of votes cast for their respective electoral lists the introduction of the threshold prevents excessive parliamentary fragmentation and thus ensures normal functioning of the parliament and buttresses the stability of the legislature and the constitutional foundations in general as a result of the reform political parties become the only collective actors of the electoral process the reform of the electoral system requires that the legal basis for the functioning of the multiparty system be adjusted so that the party system is capable of reconciling the interests and needs of society as a whole and of its various social and regional strata and groups and of representing them adequately in the state duma the state duma is an organised form of representation of the will and interests of the multiethnic population of the that will and those interests can be expressed only by large well-structured political parties this is one of the reasons for changing the requirements imposed on political parties including the minimum membership requirement for parties and their regional branches these requirements are dictated by the characteristics proper to each stage of development of the party political system they do not create insurmountable obstacles for the establishment and activities of political parties representing various political opinions are not directed against any ideology and do not prevent discussion of various political programmes the state guarantees equality of political parties before the law irrespective of the ideology aims and purposes set out in their articles of association when setting out the minimum membership requirements for political parties the federal legislator must take care on the one hand that those requirements are not excessive and do not impair the very essence of the right to freedom of association and must ensure on the other hand that the political parties are able to pursue the aims and purposes set out in their articles of association exclusively as national all-russian political parties the national legislature must be guided by the criteria of reasonable sufficiency and proportionality the quantitative requirements will be incompatible with the constitution only if the constitutional right to associate in political parties becomes illusory as a result of their application the federal legislature is entitled to set out membership requirements for political parties in the light of current historical conditions in the those requirements can be changed in one way or the other because they are not arbitrary but objectively justified by the aims in the sphere of development of the political system and maintenance of its compatibility with the basic constitutional foundations of the they do not abolish diminish or disproportionately restrict the citizens constitutional right to associate in political parties political parties are created to ensure the involvement of citizens of the in the political life of russian society by means of forming and expressing their political will participating in public and political activities elections and referenda and representing the citizens interests in state and municipal bodies therefore the legislator rightfully determined the minimum membership by reference to a political party s real ability to represent the interests of an important portion of the population and to accomplish its public functions the minimum membership requirements are not discriminatory because they do not prevent the emergence of diverse political programmes they are applied in an equal measure to all public associations portraying themselves as political parties irrespective of the ideology aims and purposes set out in their articles of association and they do not impair the very essence of the citizens right to freedom of association their application in practice shows that the constitutional right to associate in political parties remains real according to information from the ministry of justice on january seventeen political parties out of thirty-three had confirmed their compliance with the new legal requirements three political parties had decided on a voluntary basis to reorganise themselves into public associations the members of political parties which do not comply with the legal requirements established by the political parties act have a choice between increasing the number of members of their party to reach the required minimum reorganising their party into a public association founding a new party or joining another existing political party the guidelines on prohibition and dissolution of political parties and analogous measures doc cdl-inf adopted by the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission on january read as follows the commission has adopted the following guidelines states should recognise that everyone has the right to associate freely in political parties this right shall include freedom to hold political opinions and to receive and impart information without interference by a public authority and regardless of frontiers the requirement to register political parties will not in itself be considered to be in violation of this right prohibition or enforced dissolution of political parties may only be justified in the case of parties which advocate the use of violence or use violence as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution the fact alone that a party advocates a peaceful change of the constitution should not be sufficient for its prohibition or dissolution the prohibition or dissolution of political parties as a particularly far-reaching measure should be used with utmost restraint before asking the competent judicial body to prohibit or dissolve a party governments or other state organs should assess having regard to the situation of the country concerned whether the party really represents a danger to the free and democratic political order or to the rights of individuals and whether other less radical measures could prevent the said danger legal measures directed to the prohibition or legally enforced dissolution of political parties shall be a consequence of a judicial finding of unconstitutionality and shall be deemed as of an exceptional nature and governed by the principle of proportionality any such measure must be based on sufficient evidence that the party itself and not only individual members pursue political objectives using or preparing to use unconstitutional means the prohibition or dissolution of a political party should be decided by the constitutional court or other appropriate judicial body in a procedure offering all guarantees of due process openness and a fair trial. the venice commission made the following recommendations in its guidelines and explanatory report on legislation on political parties some specific issues doc cdl-ad of april registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party for a party s participation in general elections or for public financing of a party does not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under articles and of the european convention on human rights any requirements in relation to registration however must be such as are ‘ necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the measures in question countries applying registration procedures to political parties should refrain from imposing excessive requirements for territorial representation of political parties as well as for minimum membership the democratic or non-democratic character of the party organisation should not in principle be a ground for denying registration of a political party registration of political parties should be denied only in cases clearly indicated in the guidelines on prohibition of political parties and analogous measures i.e when the use of violence is advocated or used as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution the fact alone that a peaceful change of the constitution is advocated should not be sufficient for denial of registration any activity requirements for political parties as a prerequisite for maintaining the status as a political party and their control and supervision have to be assessed by the same yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society public authorities should refrain from any political or other excessive control over activities of political parties such as membership number and frequency of party congresses and meetings operation of territorial branches and subdivisions state authorities should remain neutral in dealing with the process of establishment registration where applied and activities of political parties and refrain from any measures that could privilege some political forces and discriminate others all political parties should be given equal opportunities to participate in elections any interference of public authorities with the activities of political parties such as for example denial of registration loss of the status of a political party if a given party has not succeeded in obtaining representation in the legislative bodies where applied should be motivated and legislation should provide for an opportunity for the party to challenge such decision or action in a court of law although such concern as the unity of the country can be taken into consideration member states should not impose restrictions which are not necessary in a democratic society on the establishment and activities of political unions and associations on regional and local levels when national legislation provides that parties lose their status of a political party if they do not succeed to take part in elections or to obtain representation in legislative bodies they should be allowed to continue their existence and activities under the general law on associations registration of political parties the already mentioned study on the establishment organisation and activities of political parties conducted in by the sub-commission on democratic institutions has shown that many countries view registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party for participation in general elections or for public financing this practice as the venice commission has stated before in its guidelines on prohibition and dissolution of political parties even if it were regarded as a restriction of the right to freedom of association and freedom of expression would not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under articles and of the european convention on human rights the requirements for registration however differ from one country to another registration may be considered as a measure to inform the authorities about the establishment of the party as well as about its intention to participate in elections and as a consequence benefit from advantages given to political parties as a specific type of association far-reaching requirements however can raise the threshold for registration to an unreasonable level which may be inconsistent with the convention any provisions in relation to registration must be such as are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved by the measures in question activity requirements for political parties and their control and supervision similar caution must be applied when it comes to activity requirements for political parties as a prerequisite for maintaining their status as a political party and their control and supervision far-reaching autonomy of political parties is a cornerstone of the freedoms of assembly and association and the freedom of expression as protected by the european convention on human rights as the european court of human rights has stated the convention requires that interference with the exercise of these rights must be assessed by the yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society the only type of necessity capable of justifying an interference with any of those rights is therefore one which may claim to spring from ‘ democratic society in particular control over the statute or charter of a party should be primarily internal i.e should be exercised by the members of the party as regards external control the members of a party should have access to a court in case they consider that a decision of a party organ violates its statute in general judicial control over the parties should be preferred over executive control another important aspect is that of equal treatment of parties by public authorities in the case of registration procedure if it is foreseen by national legislation the state should proceed carefully in order to avoid any possible discrimination of political forces which might be considered as representing an opposition to the ruling party in any case clear and simple procedures should exist to challenge any decision and/or act of any registration authority in a court of law political parties and elections the main objective of political parties is participation in the public life of their country elections are essential for the fulfilment of this task therefore the principle of equality between parties is of utmost importance in recent years some new democracies claim that the stability of government and the good functioning of parliament can be achieved through limiting the number of parties participating in elections this suggestion seems to be in contradiction with european standards applicable to electoral process in recent years the role of a multitude of political parties as associations expressing the will of many different parts of society is being reconsidered in a positive way preventing an excessive number of parties through the electoral system would seem to be the most effective and least objectionable method as far as political rights are concerned the general trend is to avoid restricting the number of parties by tinkering with the terms and conditions governing registration because refusal to register a party is often a convenient way for the authorities to get rid of a competitor who is irksome rather than insignificant cdl-el ch in some member states parties can lose their status of political party if they do not have any candidates elected in national elections if the provisions of articles and are to be applied with due regard to what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society they should be allowed to continue their activities under the general law on associations parties on local and regional levels member states should not restrict the right of association in a political party to the national level there should be a possibility to create parties on regional and local levels since some groups of citizens might want to associate in groups limiting their action to local and regional levels and to local and regional elections however certain new democracies consider such extensive approach to the freedom of association premature in the light of their effort to preserve the unity of the state such concern can be understood but before any restrictions are imposed the principle of proportionality and the yardstick of what is ‘ necessary in a democratic society should be considered thoroughly. the report on the participation of political parties in elections doc cdl-ad of june states as follows political parties are as some constitutions and the european court of human rights have expressly admitted essential instruments for democratic participation in fact the very concept of the political party is based on the aim of participating in the management of public affairs by the presentation of candidates to free and democratic elections they are thus a specific kind of association which in many countries is submitted to registration for participation in elections or for public financing this requirement of registration has been accepted considering it as not per se contrary to the freedom of association provided that conditions for registration are not too burdensome and requirements for registration are very different from one country to another they may include for instance organisational conditions requirement for minimum political activity of standing for elections of reaching a certain threshold of votes however some pre-conditions for registration of political parties existing in several council of europe member states requiring a certain territorial representation and a minimal number of members for their registration could be problematic in the light of the principle of free association in political parties. further in the report entitled comments on the draft law on political parties of moldova endorsed by the venice commission at its plenary session doc cdl-ad of june the venice commission criticised the requirements contained in the moldovan draft law that a political party have no fewer than five thousand members in at least half of the territorial administrative units with no fewer than members domiciled in each of the aforementioned territorial administrative units it found those requirements to be unusually high as compared to other democracies in western europe and almost impossible to fulfil for any local association in another report on the venice commission criticised the statutory requirement that political parties submit membership lists for review every year the relevant part of that report entitled joint recommendations on the electoral law and the electoral administration in of the european commission for democracy through law and the office for democratic institutions and human rights of the osce doc cdl-ad of july read as follows has gone too far in registering political opinions in that the membership lists have to be submitted for review every year it is difficult to find a justification for this once a party is registered and has run for elections the results of the elections could be sufficient evidence of its support only the need for renewed registration of such parties which never gained support during elections is admissible submitting membership lists to the government if a party has won seats in parliament in a number of municipalities or rayons seems at best unnecessarily bureaucratic at worst abusive moreover the requirement of support across the country discriminates regionally based parties. the venice commission has also adopted a code of good practice in electoral matters doc cdl-ad of october the explanatory report to the code of practice reads in so far as relevant as follows stability of the law is crucial to credibility of the electoral process which is itself vital to consolidating democracy rules which change frequently and especially rules which are complicated may confuse voters above all voters may conclude rightly or wrongly that electoral law is simply a tool in the hands of the powerful and that their own votes have little weight in deciding the results of elections in practice however it is not so much stability of the basic principles which needs protecting they are not likely to be seriously challenged as stability of some of the more specific rules of electoral law especially those covering the electoral system per se the composition of electoral commissions and the drawing of constituency boundaries these three elements are often rightly or wrongly regarded as decisive factors in the election results and care must be taken to avoid not only manipulation to the advantage of the party in power but even the mere semblance of manipulation it is not so much changing voting systems which is a bad thing they can always be changed for the better as changing them frequently or just before within one year of elections even when no manipulation is intended changes will seem to be dictated by immediate party political interests. the court conducted a comparative study of the legislation of twenty-one member states of the council of europe thirteen of those states impose a minimum membership requirement on political parties in particular in order to obtain registration political parties are required to prove that they have a certain number of founding members the required minimum membership ranges from in turkey and in croatia to in moldova and in five countries austria france germany italy and do not impose any minimum membership requirement on political parties three more countries while not setting a membership requirement as such make registration of a political party conditional on producing a certain number of signatures of support in finland and norway and in in only two countries is there a statutory requirement that a political party establish regional branches in a certain number of regions in more than one half of the regions in ukraine and in all regions in the legislation of two more countries requires political parties to have members domiciled in a certain number of regions no fewer than one hundred and fifty members in more than one half of the regions in moldova and no fewer than seven hundred members in at least eighteen regions in romania it must also be noted that out of the twenty-one countries studied by the court the legislation of only two countries latvia and restricts the right to nominate candidates for elections to political parties or their coalitions the legislation of all the other countries examined allows the nomination of election candidates by associations of citizens or by self-nomination the court also studied a report adopted by the venice commission on the establishment organisation and activities of political parties on the basis of the replies to the questionnaire on the establishment organisation and activities of political parties doc cdl-ad of february which in so far as relevant reads as follows this report has been prepared from the replies to the questionnaire on establishment organisation and activities of political parties which was adopted by the sub-commission on democratic institutions venice march cdl-dem the questionnaire is a follow-up to a similar document which was sent out earlier as part of preparations for the adoption of guidelines and report on the financing of political parties march cdl-inf this time countries responded they are listed here in alphabetical order albania andorra armenia austria azerbaijan belgium bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria canada croatia cyprus czech republic estonia finland france georgia germany greece hungary ireland italy japan republic of korea kyrghyz republic latvia liechtenstein lithuania luxembourg the former yugoslav republic of macedonia malta the netherlands poland romania the russian federation slovakia slovenia spain sweden switzerland turkey ukraine and the united kingdom does the law distinguish between political parties on the local the regional and the national level the majority of responding countries do not distinguish between political parties on different levels of government no matter whether the governmental system of the country is unitary federal or other austria greece finland france italy japan luxembourg malta and may be mentioned as examples there are exceptions however distinguishes between political parties on the federal and on the provincial level prohibits explicitly establishment of political parties on the grounds of regional or territorial basis germany does not include political activities on the local level as aiming at taking part in the forming of the will in the representation of the people i.e the whole of the people associations which are politically active on the local level only therefore do not fall within the concept of political party in the sense of the constitution and the german legislation on political parties what are the substantive and procedural requirements to establish a political party a number of countries have a specific legal framework for the activities of political parties and their establishment in general concerning its political programme concerning founding members or concerning other individuals who in some way have to support the establishment and their number citizenship geographical distribution etc some countries impose on political parties an obligation to go through a registration process almost all countries mentioned in the first group in paragraph have to go through a registration process or at least through deposition of their articles of association with the competent authorities of their country this process is justified by the need of formal recognition of an association as a political party some of these additional requirements can differ from one country to another d minimum membership azerbaijan bosnia and herzegovina canada croatia czech republic estonia georgia germany greece kyrgyzstan latvia lithuania russian federation slovakia and turkey i signatures attesting certain territorial representation moldova russian federation turkey and after these requirements are met a competent body ministry of justice for example proceeds with official registration in the case of such countries as for example austria and the charter articles of association are just submitted to the competent authority in order to be added to a special state register is a political party required to maintain national regional or local branches or offices there are no requirements in law to maintain branches or offices in a particular way in andorra austria belgium canada estonia finland france georgia hungary italy latvia liechtenstein luxembourg sweden and romania requires political parties to maintain a head office ireland requires headquarters and turkey a national office in germany requires parties to maintain regional branches and in the united kingdom a party must state whether it intends to operate in the united kingdom as a whole in part of the united kingdom or at a local level however this is no more than a statement of intention and the law does not appear to impose a legal obligation on the party to carry out this statement of intention in ukraine within six months from the date of registration a political party shall secure the formation and registration of its regional city and district organisations in most regions of ukraine in the cities of kyiv and sevastopol and in the autonomous republic of the crimea is it mandatory for political parties e.g as a prerequisite for maintaining registration or for access to public financing to present individual candidates or lists of candidates for general elections on the local regional or national level to participate in local regional or national election campaigns to get a minimum percentage of votes or a certain number of candidates elected in local regional and national elections to conduct other political activities specified by law regulations on the participation of political parties in the political process of the country are more diverse in the case of states where there is a requirement for party registration however financing from public sources is subject to detailed legislation in most countries such general trends can be observed in countries for party registration and party financing a only parties participating in general elections which attain a certain threshold can receive public funding austria belgium bosnia and herzegovina canada czech republic estonia the former yugoslav republic of macedonia france georgia germany greece japan liechtenstein lithuania luxembourg the netherlands poland russian federation spain slovenia sweden b registration is revoked if a party does not take part in a certain number of elections does not receive a minimum

the government were represented most recently by their then acting agent ms o. davydchuk the applicants complained that the ban on a strike by aerosvit aircraft cabin crew members had been in breach of their rights under article of the convention on march the application was communicated to the government written submissions were received from the european trade union confederation etuc which had been granted leave by the president to intervene as a third party article of the convention and rule of the rules of court at the material time the applicants were employed by the cjsc aerosvit airlines aerosvit as aircraft cabin crew as confirmed in particular by the minutes of the trade union s constituent assembly of july all the applicants were members of the company s trade union mr tymoshenko was its chairman on february the national mediation and reconciliation service the nmrs registered a collective labour dispute between the employees and the management of aerosvit the employees demands concerned in particular the following issues repairs to the aircraft electronic catering and air-conditioning equipment enhancing the safety of on-flight technical processes salary payments to be made no later than three days before a period of leave full and timely salary payments twice per month a pay rise and recalculation of salaries for and salary payment on the basis of the exchange rate of the us dollar and the ukrainian hryvnia as established by the national bank of ukraine with salaries to be recalculated from recalculation of long-service bonuses ensuring transportation of aircraft cabin crew to and from the airport establishing a usd per diem allowance for all foreign flights uniform cleaning and ironing to be at the employer s expense allocation of at least of the salary budget for cultural and sporting events awarding employees a bonus of from the profits and inflation adjustment of salaries if payment was delayed with effect from december on march and april the nmrs deregistered some of the employees demands noting that they had been resolved with reference to decisions of the reconciliation commissions of february and march on may the nmrs labour arbitration court delivered its decision on the employees remaining demands following a hearing in which representatives of both parties participated it found most of the demands to be legitimate and directed the employer to comply with them in the absence of any compliance measures aerosvit cabin crew including the applicants decided to embark on industrial action on september the general meeting of aerosvit employees seeking resolution of the labour dispute announced a strike of aircraft cabin crew members the strike was due to start on september and continue until the employees demands were fully met the announcement specified that all foreign flights which began prior to the beginning of the strike would be completed the meeting appointed a strike committee of six persons including all of the applicants except mr pushnyak who however attended the meeting and voted in favour of the strike the committee was vested with the following powers to conduct negotiations on behalf of the employees with the company s management and state authorities to draw attention to the strike in the mass media to receive information from the company s management on compliance with the employees requirements to initiate and participate in a reconciliation commission to organise and conduct meetings and pickets in support of the demands put forward to sign agreements with the owner or an authorised representative on resolution of the labour dispute and to consult the nmrs by september the strike committee had notified the following authorities about the decision to hold a strike the employer the nmrs the infrastructure ministry the state aviation administration the social policy ministry the state labour inspection the parliamentary ombudsman as well as a number of other institutions and organisations on september the management of aerosvit lodged a claim with the darnytskyy district court of kyiv the darnytskyy court against the flight attendants trade union seeking to have the strike declared unlawful on september the darnytskyy court held the first hearing on the case another hearing was scheduled for the morning of september the planned hearing did not take place for reasons unknown to the applicants they later discovered that the judge had been on sick leave on september the management of aerosvit airlines brought another claim this time before the boryspil city court the boryspil court and against the strike committee seeking to have the strike declared unlawful on september the boryspil court in written proceedings issued an injunction prohibiting the strike committee from holding the strike pending adjudication of the employer s claim on the same day aerosvit s management handed over a copy of the injunction to the trade union s representatives on september the company s management withdrew its earlier claim from the darnytskyy court on october the trade union challenged the boryspil court s injunction of september before the kyiv regional court of appeal the court of appeal it submitted in particular that the strike committee could not be a respondent in proceedings since it was neither an individual nor a legal entity nor was it empowered to act in courts on behalf of the employees who had decided to go on strike on october the court of appeal dismissed the aforementioned appeal on october the boryspil court found that the strike would be unlawful and banned it the court relied on section of the transport act which prohibited strikes at transport enterprises if they affected passenger carriage it noted that aerosvit was an important passenger carrier operating over eighty international routes to thirty-three counties furthermore given that one of the major tasks of the aircraft cabin crew was to ensure the safety of passengers the court considered applicable section of the resolution of labour disputes act which prohibited strikes if they were likely to endanger human life or health it also made a general reference to article of the constitution the trade union appealed it reiterated the arguments of its earlier appeal of october concerning the standing of the strike committee it also argued that the first-instance court had wrongly applied the transport act when it should instead have applied the resolution of labour disputes act on november and december respectively the kyiv regional court of appeal and the higher specialised court for civil and criminal matters upheld the judgment of october on january the specialised court s final ruling was served on the strike committee article reads as follows employees have the right to strike in order to protect their economic and social interests the procedure for exercising the right to strike shall be established by law taking into account the need to ensure national security the protection of health and the rights and freedoms of other persons no one shall be forced to participate or to not participate in a strike a strike may only be prohibited on the basis of law. the pertinent provisions are the following the parties to a collective labour dispute shall be at an occupational level employees certain categories of employees or a trade union or another organisation authorised by employees to represent their interests and the owner of an enterprise or the employer s representative the body authorised by employees to represent their interests shall be the only authorised representative of the employees during the period such a dispute exists a strike is a temporary collective and voluntary cessation of work by employees non-appearance at work breach of labour duties with the aim of resolving a collective labour dispute strike action shall be an extreme means of resolving a collective labour dispute when all other possibilities for such resolution have been exhausted if the employer refuses to allow the claims of employees or of a body authorised by them or of a trade union or of an association of trade unions or of a body authorised by them. pursuant to article of the constitution of ukraine employees have the right to strike in order to protect their economic and social interests the procedure for exercising the right to strike is established by this act a strike may be commenced if conciliatory procedures have not led to the settlement of a collective labour dispute or if the employer avoids conciliatory procedures or does not comply with an agreement reached in the course of resolution of a collective labour dispute striking shall be prohibited if the cessation of work by employees endangers human life or health or the environment or if it hinders the prevention of a natural disaster an accident a catastrophe an epidemic or an epizootic outbreak or if it hampers rectification of their consequences employees with the exception of technical and maintenance personnel of prosecution authorities courts military forces state authorities security and law-enforcement bodies shall be banned from striking until other laws and by-laws are brought into compliance with this act they shall apply so far as they do not contradict it the cabinet of ministers of ukraine shall submit proposals for bringing other laws and by-laws into compliance with this act within three months section strikes at transport enterprises provides cessation of work strike at transport enterprises may take place if the enterprise s management fails to comply with tariff agreements except in cases where passenger transportation or maintenance of a continuous production cycle are concerned and also where a strike would endanger human life or health. the above provision has not been amended since the act entered in force in some proposed amendments were drafted in following recommendations by the ilo committee on freedom of association but with no result see paragraphs below furthermore on august a draft law on amendments to section of the transport act with a view to bringing it into conformity with the constitution of ukraine and the resolution of labour disputes conflicts act was registered in the verkhovna rada the ukrainian parliament the final version of the draft proposed repealing section altogether on june the parliamentary committee for transport and communication recommended that parliament reject the draft text and referred to the cabinet of ministers position that it would destabilise the transport sector and be harmful to the social and economic interests of the state in consequence the draft text was rejected on january the ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights issued a press release with the following content the ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights ms valeriya lutkovska has sent a letter to mr mykola azarov the prime minister of ukraine concerning protection of the constitutional right to strike of transport employees representatives of the all-ukrainian trade union of pilots and also a trade union of stewards in an airline company have repeatedly applied to the ombudsman concerning the unconstitutionality of the provisions of the ukrainian transport act and violation of their legitimate rights monitoring by the commissioner has revealed that inadequate regulation of this issue has in fact made it impossible to protect the rights of transport employees and has led to ambiguous interpretation of certain provisions of the law in addition this lack of regulation genuinely raises the possibility of mass violations of employment law by employers and at the same time unplanned unexpected instances of unavailability of transportation services etc the working group created by the commissioner for human rights with participation by representatives from the ministry of social policy the ministry of infrastructure the ministry of economic development and the national service for mediation and reconciliation and delegates from the joint representative bodies of employers and trade unions drew up the draft law of ukraine on amendments to certain legislative acts of ukraine concerning guarantees for exercising the constitutional right to strike it was proposed that section of the ukrainian transport act be worded as follows strikes at transport enterprises shall take place in accordance with the legislation on the resolution of collective labour disputes conflicts the words or national security were added to section of the ukrainian law on the resolution of collective labour disputes conflicts immediately after the words human health according to the commissioner for human rights ms valeriya lutkovska the ministry of social policy the ministry of infrastructure the ministry of economic development the secretariat of the council of national security and defence and the trade-union representatives of trade unions agreed to the draft law without observations taking into consideration the importance of resolving this issue on the legislative level the ombudsman ms valeriya lutkovska submitted for the government s consideration the draft law thus drawn up for subsequent submission to the verkhovna rada the prime minister mr mykola azarov instructed the heads of the ministries of infrastructure social policy economic development finance and justice to examine the draft of the above-mentioned law and to introduce the agreed proposals to it the commissioner for human rights hopes that the draft law will soon be submitted for consideration by parliament. article of the covenant reads as follows the states parties to the present convention undertake to ensure a the right of everyone to form trade unions and join the trade union of his choice subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned for the promotion and protection of his economic and social interests no restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others b the right of trade unions to establish national federations or confederations and the right of the latter to form or join international trade union organisations c the right of trade unions to function freely subject to no limitations other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others d the right to strike provided that it is exercised in conformity with the laws of the particular country. the pertinent principles of the international labour organisation ilo are summarised in its publication ilo principles concerning the right to strike first published in the international labour review vol no with a further edition in the relevant extracts read as follows over the years in line with this principle the committee on freedom of association has recognized that strike action is a right and not simply a social act and has also made it clear it is a right which workers and their organizations trade unions federations and confederations are entitled to enjoy reduced the number of categories of workers who may be deprived of this right as well as the legal restrictions on its exercise which should not be excessive linked the exercise of the right to strike to the objective of promoting and defending the economic and social interests of workers stated that the legitimate exercise of the right to strike should not entail prejudicial penalties of any sort which would imply acts of anti-union discrimination these views expressed by the committee on freedom of association coincide in substance with those of the committee of experts the committee has chosen to recognize a general right to strike with the sole possible exceptions being those which may be imposed for public servants and workers in essential services in the strict sense of the term obviously the committee on freedom of association also accepts the prohibition of strikes in the event of an acute national emergency ilo para over time the supervisory bodies of the ilo have brought greater precision to the concept of essential services in the strict sense of the term for which strike action may be prohibited in the committee of experts defined such services as those the interruption of which would endanger the life personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population ilo para this definition was adopted by the committee on freedom of association shortly afterwards clearly what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country likewise there can be no doubt that a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope thus endangering the life personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population ilo para the committee on freedom of association has none the less given its opinion in a general manner on the essential or non-essential nature of a series of specific services thus the committee has considered to be essential services in the strict sense where the right to strike may be subject to major restrictions or even prohibitions to be the hospital sector electricity services water supply services the telephone service air traffic control ibid. para in contrast the committee has considered that in general the following do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term and therefore the prohibition to strike does not pertain ibid. para transport generally aircraft repairs these few examples do not represent an exhaustive list of essential services the committee has not mentioned more services because its opinion is dependent on the nature of the specific situations and on the context which it has to examine and because complaints are rarely submitted regarding the prohibition of strikes in essential services when the committee of experts uses the expression essential services it refers only to essential services in the strict sense of the term i.e those the interruption of which would endanger the life personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population in which restrictions or even a prohibition may be justified accompanied however by compensatory guarantees nevertheless a minimum service would be appropriate in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers one might consider ensuring that users basic needs are met and that facilities operate safely or without interruption ibid. para in the general survey on the fundamental conventions concerning rights at work in the light of the ilo declaration on social justice for a fair globalisation international labour conference session the ilo committee of experts on the implementation of conventions and recommendations ceacr indicated that the air transport should be excluded from essential services and that the right to strike of workers employed in that sector should be recognised on february the independent trade union of workers of the illichivsk maritime commercial port lodged a complaint with the ilo committee on freedom of association against the government of ukraine alleging violations of trade union rights including the right to strike the government s reply was that under the transport act strikes were prohibited in continuously operating transport enterprises in its report no of november report in which the committee requests to be informed of development the committee stated in cases concerning violations of the right to strike the committee has always recognized the right to strike of workers and their organizations as a legitimate means of defending their economic and social interests it has also considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled under the law in order to render a strike lawful should be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organizations the committee has also emphasized that while the right to strike may be restricted or prohibited in essential services in the strict sense of the term that is services the interruption of which would endanger the life personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population provided that the workers are given appropriate guarantees port activities generally do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term although they are an important public service in which a minimum service could be required in case of a strike the committee therefore requests the government to amend section of the transport act to ensure that it can not be construed as prohibiting strikes in ports in the light of its foregoing conclusions the committee invites the governing body to approve the following recommendations d as regards the court rulings that the strike planned for september was illegal the committee emphasizing that the ports do not constitute essential services in which strikes might be prohibited although they are important public services in which a minimum service might be required in the event of a strike requests the government to amend section of the transport act in order to ensure that it can not be construed as allowing the prohibition of strikes in ports. subsequently the committee issued several reports on the effect given to its recommendations in particular in november it issued report no in which it referred to the government s communication of august stating that the ministry of transport was preparing a new transport bill which would include the following provisions voluntary cessation of work strike in transport undertakings may be initiated in accordance with the procedure established under relevant legislation except in cases where such cessation of work would endanger the life and health of individuals or pose an environmental threat hinder the prevention of natural disasters accidents or major incidents epidemic or epizootic outbreaks or impede efforts to deal with the consequences of such events. the committee note d with interest the draft amendment in respect of section of the transport act concerning strike action and requested the government to keep it informed of the progress made in this respect the examination of the case by the committee was however completed without any such progress being reported see also paragraph above concerning further drafting efforts the ilo committee on freedom of association has published its conclusions in a number of other transport cases in which it was found that restrictions on the right to strike are not in conformity with the ilo standards in particular the relevant extracts from its report session geneva november read as follows case no france report in which the committee requests to be kept informed of developments the committee recalls that in the airport sector only air traffic control can be regarded as an essential service justifying restrictions on the right to strike neither the distribution of fuel to ensure that flights continue to operate nor transport per se can be therefore considered essential services in the strictest sense of the term moreover economic consideration should not be invoked as a justification for restrictions on the right to strike however the committee has in the past had cause to consider that when a service that is not essential in the strict sense of the term but is part of a very important sector in the country as could be said of passenger and goods transport is brought to a standstill measures to guarantee a minimum service may be justified such a service could also be a potential alternative solution in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers one might consider ensuring that users basic needs are met or facilities operate safely or without interruption. case no greece report in which the committee requests to be kept informed of developments the transportation of passengers and commercial goods is not an essential service in the strict sense of the term however this is a public service of primary importance where the requirement of a minimum service in the event of a strike can be justified in general the determination of minimum services and the minimum number of workers providing them should involve not only the public authorities but also the relevant employers and workers organizations this not only allows a careful exchange of viewpoints on what in a given situation can be considered to be the minimum services that are strictly necessary but also contributes to guaranteeing that the scope of the minimum service does not result in the strike becoming ineffective in practice because of its limited impact and to dissipating possible impressions in the trade union organizations that a strike has come to nothing because of over-generous and unilaterally fixed minimum services. the relevant provisions read as follows with a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to bargain collectively the contracting parties undertake to promote joint consultation between workers and employers to promote where necessary and appropriate machinery for voluntary negotiations between employers or employers organisations and workers organisations with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements to promote the establishment and use of appropriate machinery for conciliation and voluntary arbitration for the settlement of labour disputes and recognise the right of workers and employers to collective action in cases of conflicts of interest including the right to strike subject to obligations that might arise out of collective agreements previously entered into the rights and principles set forth in part i when effectively realised and their effective exercise as provided for in part ii shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations not specified in those parts except such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest national security public health or morals the restrictions permitted under this charter to the rights and obligations set forth herein shall not be applied for any purpose other than that for which they have been prescribed it is understood that each contracting party may insofar as it is concerned regulate the exercise of the right to strike by law provided that any further restriction that this might place on the right can be justified under the terms of article in its digest of the case-law of the european committee of social rights of september the committee whose function is to rule on the conformity of the situation in signatory states with the european social charter stated as follows in the section interpretation of the different provisions the quotation below is provided without the footnotes which contain references to specific cases the rights and principles set forth in part i when effectively realised and their effective exercise as provided for in part ii shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations not specified in those parts except such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest national security public health or morals prohibiting strikes in sectors which are essential to the community is deemed to serve a legitimate purpose since strikes in these sectors could pose a threat to public interest national security and/or public health however simply banning strikes even in essential sectors particularly when they are extensively defined i.e energy or health is not deemed proportionate to the specific requirements of each sector at most the introduction of a minimum service requirement in these sectors might be considered in conformity with article on october the committee issued its conclusions on the situation in ukraine as regards collective action the relevant extracts read as follows the committee takes note of the information contained in the report submitted by ukraine article of the constitution guarantees workers the right to strike to protect their economic and social interests in addition section of the law on trade unions guarantees the right of trade unions to inter alia organise and stage strikes in order to protect workers labour and socioeconomic rights the law on the procedure of settlement of collective disputes contains provisions on the right to strike including the procedure to be followed prior to exercising the right to strike etc under article the right to strike may be restricted provided that any restriction satisfies the conditions laid down in article g which provides that restrictions on the rights guaranteed by the charter that are prescribed by law serve a legitimate purpose and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest national security public health or morals the committee notes that there are restrictions on the right to strike for workers in the emergency and rescue services workers at nuclear facilities workers in underground undertakings as well as workers at electric power engineering enterprises the committee recalls that restricting strikes in sectors which are essential to the community is deemed to serve a legitimate purpose since strikes in these sectors could pose a threat to public interest national security and/or public health however simply banning strikes even in essential sectors particularly when they are extensively defined is not deemed proportionate to the specific requirements of each sector but providing for the conformity with article therefore the committee asks for further information on the extent of the restrictions on the right to strike in these sectors in particular as regards underground undertakings in addition the committee notes that according to the report strikes in the transport sector may be prohibited inter alia if the transportation of passengers is affected the committee seeks confirmation that this interpretation is correct in this respect it refers above to its case law mentioned above the relevant extract of resolution cm/reschs on collective complaint no against bulgaria reads as follows the committee finds that it has not been established that the restriction of the right to strike imposed by section of the railway transport act pursues a legitimate purpose in the meaning of article the alleged and not further specified consequences for the economy do not qualify as a legitimate aim in this respect in the absence of a legitimate purpose the restriction to the right to strike according to section of the railway transport act may not be considered as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article the relevant section of the conclusions of october in respect of lithuania reads as follows the labour code provides an obligation to provide minimum services to meet the immediate needs of the community in the event of strikes in undertakings and sectors covered by article of the labour code such minimum services are determined either by the government after consultation with the tripartite council or by the relevant municipal executive after consultations with the parties to the collective dispute the undertakings and sectors concerned are the railways and public transport civil aviation communications and energy enterprises health care and pharmaceutical institutions food water sewage and waste disposal enterprises oil refineries enterprises with a continuous production cycle and other enterprises where work stoppages would result in grave and hazardous consequences for the community or human life and health. the relevant part of the conclusions of june in respect of slovenia reads as follows the report points out that as regards the sectors of the police force the defence forces aviation customs and railway transport as well as other activities where a minimum level of the working process is required to be carried out there have practically been no relevant strikes in recent years since disputes are resolved by negotiations following the prior announcement of a strike. the relevant extracts read as follows emphasis added as europe undergoes rapid political economic social and cultural integration within the european union and in the wider council of europe area the vulnerability of each country to disruptions in others is becoming increasingly pronounced this holds also for strike actions in essential services whether in public or private ownership such as in the transport sector especially air transport or in public health at a time of intensified international contacts and labour mobility the wide differences in national legislation and practices between european countries are against this background increasingly at variance with the overall state of european integration and prejudicial to it of further concern is the lack of balance in many countries between on the one hand the right to strike including in essential services as enshrined in various treaties from the council of europe s revised european social charter ets no to the european union s charter of fundamental rights and on the other hand the fundamental right of citizens to pursue their lives unhindered preserve their health and well-being and the right of society to function and to maintain its overall ability to function as well as protect the health and welfare of its citizens in certain european countries this balance is seriously tilted against citizens and society the parliamentary assembly against this background calls on the governments of the member states of the council of europe to carry out studies on the cost of strikes in essential public services to the national economy companies and citizens both directly in the form of lost output and indirectly such as through impaired social relations and harm done to a country s international reputation and to collate and compare the results at the level of the council of europe to intensify research and the exchange of information on laws and regulations in force in different council of europe member states as regards the right to strike in essential services or limitations thereto to harmonise as far as possible national legislation governing strikes in essential services so that citizens throughout the council of europe area can be protected adequately and in a homogeneous manner to make the fullest possible use toward this end of the provisions of the revised european social charter governing the right to strike and the protection of other social rights of citizens including in the charter s enforcement mechanism to encourage similar efforts within the more limited membership of the european union via eu legislation capable of subsequently being applied with the necessary adaptations in the council of europe area as a whole,case originated application ukraine lodged court article convention

assembly записник од основачкото собрание included the following statement nuns gathered at the assembly do not accept the teaching of the macedonian orthodox church which they consider wrong and unorthodox consequently they do not want to have any canonical communication with episcopes and priests of the macedonian orthodox church not only is that church in dispute раскол with all other orthodox churches it is not recognised by anyone this is so because all other churches consider its teaching heretical and wrong we do not want to waste our life in religious doubt to be led by immature and non-religious people we would be offended on religious grounds if we are associated with another religious community on the same date the founding members created the following official documents a a founding decision b decisions authorising o.m to represent the applicant association and submit an application for its registration and c the charter статут of the applicant association

chrysostom it found that the application for registration did not meet the requirements laid down in sections and of the act on the legal status of a church religious community and association the act see paragraphs and below in that a it referred to a form of voluntary association of physical persons which was not covered by the act and b the registration of the applicant association would violate

charter the court did not elaborate further on the second ground on which it based its decision the applicant association complained about that decision arguing that it had sought to be registered as a religious community under the name specified in the founding documents which was evident from the application for registration it also submitted that non-registration was a very drastic measure in this connection it argued that the court should have indicated any shortcomings that were to be rectified the court had failed to explain whose religious beliefs would be affected by its registration assuming that it referred to the followers of the moc the court had not explained how its registration would violate their rights the applicant association pointed out that in the registration court had refused to register it as a non-governmental organisation and had ruled that an association with such a name should seek registration under the legislation regulating religious communities and associations that was in force at the time on april the skopje court of appeal dismissed the applicant association s appeal and upheld the lower court s decision endorsing the reasons given therein on

protection of her rights and freedoms but had complained on behalf of the religious community with which she was associated it also held that the complainant had sought protection of freedoms and rights only formally without submitting any arguments evidence or facts lastly the court stated that the complainant had requested that it review the application of the law by the registration court in the proceedings for the registration of the religious community which according to the constitutional court was beyond its jurisdiction section of the act official gazette provides for the

the case originated in an application no against the republic of bulgaria lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention on april the applicants were the united macedonian organisation ilinden ilinden a non-governmental organisation based in south-west bulgaria in an area known as the pirin region or the geographic region of pirin macedonia mr yordan kostadinov ivanov a bulgarian national born in and living in sandanski who is ilinden s chairman and mr ivan dimitrov hadzhiev a bulgarian national born in and living in sofia who is a member of ilinden s board of management the applicants were represented by mr k. kanev chairman of the bulgarian helsinki committee a non-governmental organisation based in sofia on january the president of the section gave mr kanev leave to represent the applicants in all pending and future cases in which he personally acts as a representative rule a in fine of the rules of court the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agent ms m. dimitrova and by ms b. simeonova junior expert both of the ministry of justice the applicants alleged that the bulgarian courts refusal to register ilinden had been in breach of their right to freedom of association they also alleged that the refusal which had in their view been based on the bulgarian state s policy to deny the existence of a macedonian minority in bulgaria had been discriminatory on september mr yonko grozev the judge elected in respect of bulgaria withdrew from sitting in the case rule accordingly on october the president selected ms maiia rousseva as ad hoc judge from the list of five persons whom the republic of bulgaria had designated as eligible to serve in that office article of the convention and rule a meanwhile on august the court decided to give priority to the application rule and on october decided to give the government notice of it the background to the refusal to register ilinden at issue in this case has been set out in detail in the judgments in the following cases stankov and the united macedonian organisation ilinden v. bulgaria nos and echr united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v. bulgaria no october united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria no october ivanov and others v. bulgaria no november united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria no january united macedonian organisation ilinden and ivanov v. bulgaria no no october united macedonian organisation ilinden and others v. bulgaria no no october singartiyski and others v. bulgaria no october and united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others v. bulgaria no nos and october on september ilinden s board of management applied to the blagoevgrad regional court for it to be registered as an association on february the blagoevgrad regional court refused the application and on april its decision was upheld by the sofia court of appeal a detailed account of those proceedings may be found in yordan ivanov and others v. bulgaria no january on march the second and third applicants and seven other people held a meeting at which they resolved to set up ilinden as an association they defined ilinden s aims and the means that it would use to attain them adopted its articles of association and elected its board of management which consisted of all nine of them shortly after that ilinden s board of management applied to the blagoevgrad regional court for it to be registered as an association in a decision of june реш № от г. по ф. д № г. бос the blagoevgrad regional court refused the application it first observed that even though ilinden had declared that it intended to be an association which only served the interests of its members its aims as set out in its articles of association showed that in reality it meant to serve broader public interests see paragraph below the court went on to note that ilinden s articles of association stated that it would strive for inter alia the introduction of the macedonian language in schools the protection of the right of macedonians to refute propaganda about their history and culture and the protection of macedonian cultural heritage which was being subjected to ethnocide by bulgarian cultural institutions the articles of association also stated that ilinden would organise seminars and press conferences to expose the reasons which underlay the policy of forced assimilation and discrimination of and xenophobia towards macedonians in bulgaria according to the articles of association ilinden was a macedonian organisation based on a macedonian ethnic foundation and origin within the boundaries of bulgaria and it would remind people of the terror perpetrated by bulgaria of the thousands of macedonians killed of the violence the prisons and the deprivation of basic human rights and freedoms of macedonians after which amounted to crimes under international law for the court all those statements gave the impression that ilinden intended to stir up national and ethnic hatred contrary to article of the constitution see paragraph below moreover the statements combined with the existence albeit brief of a political party called the united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin whose re-registration had recently been refused and with the existence of organisations bearing the same or similar names led to the conclusion that the intention was to mislead society and to obtain the registration of an organisation pursuing political aims see paragraphs below or an organisation directed against the unity of the nation this was also contrary to section of the non-profit legal persons act see paragraph below which barred associations from having misleading names lastly the association s intended name was not unique as required by law ilinden s founders appealed they submitted that the court had misconstrued ilinden s articles of association and had erred in finding that its activities would be political or directed against the unity of the nation the real reason for the refusal to register ilinden had been that it advocated views which were at odds with the official ones in a decision of november реш № от г. по ф. д № г. сас то a three-member panel of the sofia court of appeal upheld the refusal to register ilinden by two votes to one the court began by saying that when assessing the aims of an association seeking registration it had to base itself chiefly on the articles of association but since by law in registration proceedings the court had to examine the reality of the matter rather than carry out a mere formal check it had to have regard not just to the aims set out in the articles of association but to the entirety of the articles and on that basis ascertain the founders real aims and intentions the court also had to bear in mind the traditions which the association purported to represent and the historical figures with which it identified the past activities if known of its founders leaders and supporters as well as the positions they had advocated all those elements had to be juxtaposed with the aims set out in the articles of association with a view to verifying whether those aims were not in effect a cover for other aims in doing so and thus balancing the rights of the founders of the association against the rights of others and the public interest the court could rely not only on the material in the case file but also on facts which were publicly known and of which it could therefore take judicial notice in ilinden s case it had been common knowledge sufficiently publicised in both bulgarian and foreign media that since some of its founders leaders and supporters had in a persistent manner openly challenged both those who had opposed their views and the state authorities which had led to a string of breaches of public order clashes between ilinden s supporters and their opponents on account of the views expressed by the former about macedonian history reported in the media seen against that background the declaration in ilinden s articles of association that people of any ethnicity could become members did not reflect the reality of the situation which was that the organisation had been conceived as one based purely on macedonian ethnicity the same went for the declaration in the articles of association that ilinden would only resort to peaceful means to achieve its aims this had been belied by the organisation s record of provoking its opponents and the state authorities by making strongly worded statements about violence against macedonians such statements had featured in its articles of association as well which had led to real public clashes the court had to also take into account the complex ethnic and religious situation in some neighbouring countries as well as the severe migrant crisis affecting all of europe and bulgaria in particular as a front-line state of the european union that crisis coupled with the recent likewise commonly known tragic events in central european countries showed a categorical need to mobilise all available state and social resources in those circumstances the application to register ilinden had to be turned down for two reasons firstly the pursuit of its real aims seen against the backdrop of the heightened sensitivities of the population in pirin macedonia where it was based could have led to serious tensions and breaches of public order caused by or involving supporters of the organisation as had happened in the past in the tense situation facing bulgaria and its neighbouring states that had to be seen as a genuine possibility secondly the realisation of ilinden s right to freedom of association would infringe the rights of all bulgarians who did not support its aims or the means which it intended to use to attain those aims all were entitled to believe that they were not citizens of a state which had committed international crimes that they did not engage in their capacity as bulgarian citizens in propaganda and manipulation of the history and culture of a neighbouring country and that they were not citizens of a state whose institutions had subjected the cultural heritage of part of its population to ethnocide the sofia court of appeal concluded that it was necessary to refuse the registration application even though it recognised that it was also possible to dissolve an already registered association if it engaged in anti-constitutional or unlawful conduct the refusal was a justified preventive measure the dissenting judge noted that ilinden s founders had complied with all formal requirements of the law she went on to say that the registration regime was not to be used to hinder the exercise of the fundamental right to associate with others and that the case called for the direct application of article of the convention which was part of bulgarian law she then noted how that article had been construed by the european court of human rights in several cases including united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin and others and united macedonian organisation ilinden and others both cited above and stated that in her view the fact that an association advocated a form of minority consciousness could not justify a restriction of its rights under that article the court s ruling on that point in stankov and the united macedonian organisation ilinden cited above had to be taken into account when examining the registration request at issue there was moreover no evidence of actions by ilinden s founders which ran counter to the prohibition in article of the constitution see paragraph below the refusal to register it was thus disproportionate and unjustified ilinden s founders sought to appeal on points of law on february the judge-rapporteur of the sofia court of appeal who under the relevant rules of procedure had to check the appeal s admissibility before forwarding it to the supreme court of cassation sent it back to the appellants he noted that under the applicable rules of procedure as consistently construed by the supreme court of cassation no appeal lay against appellate decisions confirming refusals to register an association in a final decision of july опр № от г. по ч. т. д № г. вкс i т о the supreme court of cassation dismissed the founders appeal against the judge-rapporteur s order it likewise found that under the applicable rules of procedure which it had already construed in several cases the sofia court of appeal s decision was not amenable to appeal pursuant to article of the constitution of associations may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties in a decision of april реш № от г. по к. д № г. обн. дв бр г the constitutional court held inter alia that political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties within the meaning of article were defined by article of the constitution as those which facilitate the formation of the citizens political will through elections or other democratic means the court went on to say that what was essential for this type of political activity was direct participation in the process of forming the bodies through which according to the constitution the people exercise d power the court also held that the activities of a political party in connection with upcoming elections encompassed the holding of rallies assemblies and other forms of public campaigning in support of the party and the candidates nominated by it which were also activities aimed at forming the citizens political will in january the plenary meeting of the supreme court of cassation s commercial section asked the constitutional court to give a binding interpretation of article in a decision of march опр № от г. по к. д № г. обн. дв бр г the constitutional court declined the request it held that it had not been shown as required under its case-law that there were divergences in the application of that provision and that it was only competent to give a binding interpretation of a constitutional provision if there was a duly established uncertainty in its meaning pursuant to article of the constitution organisations whose activities are directed against the country s sovereignty or territorial integrity or against the nation s unity or which aim to stir up racial national ethnic or religious hatred or to violate the rights and freedoms of others as well as organisations creating secret or paramilitary structures or which seek to attain their goals through violence are prohibited the non-profit legal persons act

decisions of and may with the audiencia provincial of valladolid on october the audiencia provincial confirmed the dismissal of the proceedings against the policemen the audiencia provincial of valladolid stated that the police intervention had been justified not because the protesters had tried to enter the restaurant for which there was no evidence but because the protesters had been holding a placard with which they had occupied a public road preventing the movement of vehicles and people .... everything had been due to a police response to a situation of violence and disorder generated by people who had refused to abide by police orders to dissolve the demonstration and remove the placard the individuals had refused to identify themselves properly kicked struggled insulted and pushed the police officers who had had to repel that action resulting in injuries on both sides what differentiate d one action from another obviously was that the police had acted legitimately while the demonstrators had opposed the actions of the police in an active and violent manner on november the applicant lodged an amparo appeal she argued that her right to a fair trial had been

not duly complied with the obligation to prove that her appeal was one of special constitutional relevance on april a hearing was held before valladolid criminal judge no against three of the accused protesters no information has been submitted about why the case against the fourth protester was not heard on the same day by a judgment of april given by the same judge the three protesters were

had taken place when the police had tried to take the placard away from those holding it it could be seen in the footage that police officers were kicking people the judge found that the attitude and behaviour of the protesters had not justified the indiscriminate use of force by the police against them the judge furthermore pointed out that the protesters had not impeded the movement of traffic

the case originated in an application no against the republic of turkey lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a trade union formed under turkish law eğitim ve bilim emekçileri sendikası also known as eğitim-sen the applicant union on june the applicant union was represented by mr a. sayılır a lawyer practising in the turkish government the government were represented by their agent the applicant union complained of a violation of articles and of the convention on november notice of the application was given to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article of the convention eğitim-sen the education and science workers union the union was formed in ankara on january according to the information it has provided the union has members with branches and is present in towns and cities it is affiliated to the kesk kamu emekçileri sendikaları konfederasyonu the confederation of public sector workers union which is a member of education international on september the union amended article b of its constitution to read as follows eğitim-sen defends the right of all individuals in society to receive with equality and freedom a democratic secular scientific and cost-free education in their mother tongue. on february the governor of ankara requested the applicant union to delete the words their mother tongue from its constitution on the ground that they were in breach of articles and of the constitution and of sections and of law no on public servants unions the applicant union informed the governor that it was too busy but that it undertook to amend its constitution by june on march under section of law no the governor of ankara requested the public prosecutor of ankara to bring an action for dissolution against the applicant union on the ground that it had not carried out the requisite amendment of article b of its constitution on july the applicant union amended article b of its constitution to read as follows eğitim-sen defends the right of all individuals in society to receive education in their mother tongue and to benefit from the development of their culture. on july the public prosecutor gave a decision discontinuing the dissolution proceedings initiated by the governor on grounds of insufficient evidence and incriminating factors in his decision the public prosecutor indicated firstly that the applicant union had amended article b of its constitution which now provided that individuals should receive education in their mother tongue he further stated that the matter was being discussed in some depth both publicly and in political parties and that it would be tabled for debate in parliament he concluded that in those circumstances it was not appropriate to bring dissolution proceedings against the applicant union or criminal proceedings against the members of its board on october the ministry of labour and social security the ministry informed the applicant union that following the examination of its constitution as amended on july to comply with the relevant provisions of law no it had been concluded that the impugned article was no longer in breach of the law on june the office of the chief of staff of the armed forces requested the ministry to take the necessary measures against the applicant union on the ground that article b of its constitution as amended on july was in breach of articles and of the constitution on july the ministry requested the governor of ankara to examine the provisions of article b of the applicant union s constitution in the light of section of law no on october the governor of ankara requested the applicant union to delete the words receive education in their mother tongue from article b of its constitution on april the governor of ankara referring to the provisions of article b of the applicant union s constitution and summing up the first set of proceedings against it applied to the public prosecutor of to initiate fresh dissolution proceedings the governor explained that even though law no of october provided for the teaching of a number of languages and dialects article of the applicant union s constitution in so far as it provided for education in a language other than turkish was in breach of that law on july the public prosecutor of ankara brought proceedings against the seven members of the executive board of eğitimsen in the context of that action the prosecutor further requested the dissolution of the applicant union under section of law no on the ground that the union had not deleted the impugned wording from its constitution the ankara employment tribunal assumed jurisdiction to rule on the application for the dissolution of the applicant union pursuant to law no on july the ankara employment tribunal applying section of law no granted the applicant union a period of sixty days to amend the impugned provisions of its constitution in a judgment of september the ankara employment tribunal dismissed the application for dissolution in its reasoning it indicated in particular that the relevant articles of eğitim-sen s constitution did not jeopardise tehlike territorial national or state unity or the existing borders of the it did not find that the union had committed any unlawful action capable of suggesting that the provisions of the impugned article of eğitim-sen s constitution would be used by those opposed to the unity of the based on article of the constitution and articles and of the convention the tribunal also gave its own interpretation of articles and it explained in this connection that freedom of expression constituted the basis of a democratic and pluralistic society and that such freedom was a necessary condition for the progression of democratic societies and the personal development of each individual it emphasised that without such freedom there was no democracy it concluded that the provisions of article b of eğitim-sen s constitution were not in breach of articles and of the convention it further indicated that section of law no which granted sixty days to a union to comply with the law should be interpreted in the light of the purpose of that law according to the tribunal even if the union had not complied with the law within the time allowed it was still for the tribunal to examine whether the application was well-founded and to rule on the merits of the case on september the public prosecutor appealed on points of law in a judgment of november the court of cassation overturned the judgment of september on the ground that the ankara employment tribunal had not correctly applied section of law no it took the view that this section did not allow for any latitude of interpretation and that the dissolution of the union was mandatory where it had not complied with the provisions of the law within a period of sixty days it therefore concluded that eğitim-sen had to be dissolved as it had not complied with the law within the time allowed to it by the governor and the tribunal in a judgment of february the ankara employment tribunal contrary to the court of cassation s judgment of november reiterated its original findings it referred back to the legal reasoning used in its judgment of september and invoked the case-law on the dissolution of political parties in particular the cases concerning the united communist party of turkey and the freedom and democracy party özdep it further observed that the official language of the was turkish and that according to article of the constitution any individual attached to the republic by citizenship was turkish in its view the fact of learning a language other than the official language did not constitute an action or conduct in breach of the law but such conduct was proof of an attachment to the state of turkey whilst agreeing that the official language was turkish and that there could not be any other official language it found that there should not be any particular impediment to the learning of other languages referring to its previous reasoning based on articles and of the convention the tribunal found that there were two main grounds for the dissolution of a union an association or a political party namely an imminent threat and the criterion of violence it observed that the union whose dissolution was sought defended in its constitution the principle of education in one s own mother tongue and the development of culture it emphasised that even supposing that the wording in question was illegal the content and weight of the terms did not constitute an imminent threat or an incitement to violence and their inclusion in the union s constitution did not jeopardise territorial national or state unity or the existing borders of the republic of turkey it found on the contrary that the decision not to dissolve the union would have the effect of calming the social tension disorder and antagonism that were prevalent in society and of restoring social peace in a judgment of may the combined divisions of the court of cassation yargıtay hukuk genel kurulu quashed by a majority the judgment of the court below in its reasoning the court indicated that articles and of the convention provided for statutory limitations to the exercise of the freedoms of expression assembly and association and that they notably stipulated that such restrictions had to be necessary in a democratic society it was therefore the court s task to verify whether the restrictions imposed by domestic law on fundamental rights and freedoms were consistent with turkey s international commitments the court took the view that the union s call for education in a mother tongue other than turkish was in breach of articles and of the constitution and that it ran counter to the acceptance of a unitary state and to the existing legal system in the court s opinion the right to form a union could thus be limited and such restrictions were necessary in a democratic society the combined divisions of the court of cassation concluded that the defence of education in a mother tongue other than turkish could not rely on articles and of the convention in their dissenting opinion some of the members of the combined divisions of the court of cassation relying on section of law no observed that according to the conclusion of the court below the impugned provisions of the union s constitution were compliant with the law the dissenting judges were of the view that as a result there had been no legal basis on which to order the union to amend its constitution within sixty days they stated that the judgment had to be quashed to enable the court below to comply with section of law no and not for the purpose of having the union dissolved on july the applicant union amended the offending part of article b of its constitution to read as follows eğitim-sen defends in the context of human rights and fundamental freedoms the right of all individuals in society to receive a democratic secular scientific and cost-free education. in a judgment of october the ankara employment tribunal taking note of the amendment to the union s constitution found that there was no longer any reason to rule on the dissolution of the union since the material elements that had given rise to the action no longer existed the relevant provisions of the turkish constitution as in force at the material time read as follows article the state of constitutes with its territory and nation an indivisible whole the official language is turkish article fundamental rights and freedoms may be restricted only by law and on the grounds set out in special provisions of the constitution provided always that the essence of such rights and freedoms remain intact any such restriction must not conflict with the

citizens in their daily lives which came into effect on december kurdish language courses opened in seven towns between december and october however all have since closed and other attempts to open a circassian language school in did not come to fruition as the relevant administrative requirements could not be met the authorities have indicated that applications to open adyghe and abkhazian private courses are still being examined by the relevant governorships in accordance with the above regulation at present there are thus no private language schools open in for the teaching of the languages spoken by minority groups ecri welcomes the decision taken by the turkish authorities in october to open a living languages institute at mardin s artuklu university at which kurdish could be taught courses in syriac farsi and arabic were also reportedly to be offered at the institute s opening in february at the same time ecri notes with regret that in september the council rejected a similar application to open a department of kurdish studies and kurdish language and literature at the university of diyarbakır on the grounds that the application introduced by the local bar association had been made by a body that supported terrorism ecri recommends that the turkish authorities revise the wording of article of the constitution which prohibits the teaching of non-turkish mother tongues in schools except in accordance with provisions of international treaties ecri again emphasises that it should be possible for such tuition to be provided alongside tuition in the official language in addition ecri strongly recommends that the turkish authorities pursue their efforts in favour of tuition in languages and dialects traditionally used in it recommends that full effect be given to the existing possibility of opening private courses particularly by removing all undue administrative obstacles schooling provided in turkish to children whose mother tongue is not turkish ecri again recommends that the turkish authorities look into the situation of children of non-turkish mother tongue and ensure that every effort is made to enable them to learn turkish the language of instruction properly for example through the provision of additional courses or methods for teaching turkish as a second language more broadly ecri recommends that the authorities conduct research into the overall situation within the education system of children belonging to minority groups in order to allow targeted measures to be taken to remedy any inequalities in this field ecri recommends that the turkish authorities engage in dialogue with minority groups on the manner in which the concept of citizenship of the turkish state is taught in schools in order to ensure that the

musavat the applicant attempted to participate in a demonstration organised by the opposition on october prior to that assembly on october the organisers gave notice to the relevant authority the baku city executive authority the bcea the bcea refused to authorise the holding of the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of baku nevertheless the organisers decided to hold the demonstration as planned according to the applicant the demonstration was intended to be peaceful and was conducted in a peaceful manner the participants were demanding democratic reforms in the country the applicant had intended to attend the demonstration he and a few others attempted to march from the headquarters of the musavat party to the place where the assembly was being held however shortly after that attempt he was arrested and taken to a police station according to the applicant he was arrested by people in plain clothes on may the applicant also participated in another assembly which took place near the baku court of serious crimes in support of members of an opposition group nida who were being tried on that day the courtroom was full so some people were waiting outside the court for the outcome of the proceedings when the court announced its judgment those who had gathered outside began to protest against the judgment which they considered unfair the protest was brief spontaneous and peaceful as soon as the protesters started chanting slogans police officers and people in plain clothes began to forcibly disperse the assembly the applicant was arrested during the dispersal operation and taken to a police station where he was kept overnight in both cases on the day of the applicant s arrest an

day of his arrest in the second case he was brought before the nasimi district court on may the day following his arrest according to the applicant the hearing before the court in both cases was very brief members of the public including human rights defenders and journalists were not allowed to attend even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public according to the applicant in neither case was he given an opportunity to hire a lawyer of his own choice in both cases state-funded lawyers were appointed to assist the applicant in the second case it was the same lawyer mr s.a. who had been instructed to assist the applicant in accordance with the above-mentioned document of may drawn up by a police officer according to the records of the court hearings in both cases in their oral submissions the state-funded lawyers briefly stated that the applicant was not guilty and asked the respective court to discontinue the case in both cases the only witnesses questioned during the court hearing were police officers who according to the official records had arrested the applicant or prepared an administrative-offence report on him they testified that the applicant had staged an unauthorised protest in both cases the first-instance court found that the applicant had failed to stop participating in an unauthorised protest by a decision of october the first-instance court in the first case convicted the applicant under article of the cao and sentenced him to ten days administrative detention by a decision of may the court in the second case convicted the applicant under article of the cao and sentenced him to fifteen days administrative detention on unspecified dates the applicant lodged appeals before the baku court of appeal arguing that his convictions were in violation of his rights because the assemblies in which he had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful in addition in the second case the applicant argued that the assembly had been spontaneous the applicant also complained that his arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the respective first-instance courts had not been fair in both cases the applicant was assisted before the baku court of appeal by a lawyer of his own choice in both cases on october and may respectively the baku court of appeal dismissed the applicant s appeal and upheld the decision of the first-instance court at the time of both of the applicant s arrests under article iv of the law on freedom of assembly of november no prior written notification was required for spontaneous assemblies at the time of the applicant s arrest on october articles and of the code of administrative offences of the cao provided as follows any breach of the rules set forth under the legislation on the organisation and holding of assemblies demonstrations protests marches and pickets shall be punishable by a reprimand or a fine of seven to thirteen manats azn deliberate failure by an individual to comply with a lawful order of a police officer or military serviceman carrying out their duties to protect public order shall be punishable by a fine of twenty to twenty-five manats azn or if that sanction is inadequate in the circumstances of the case and taking into account the character of the offender by administrative detention for a term of up to fifteen days. law no of november which entered into force on january introduced new wording to article of the cao breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies under that amendment participation in an assembly organised in breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies became explicitly punishable under article of the cao furthermore a punishment in the form of administrative detention of up to fifteen days was introduced for the first time another new form of punishment introduced by the amendment was community service in addition the fine for breaching the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies was increased and the amounts fixed as follows between and manats azn for participants of an assembly between azn and for individuals who organise an assembly between azn and for persons in charge vəzifəli şəxslər who organise an assembly and between azn and for legal entities involved in the organisation of an assembly the punishments for breach of the rules on the organisation and holding of assemblies were made harsher still in may law no of may which entered into force on june increased the administrative-detention sentence set out in article of the cao to up to two months law no of november which entered into force on november increased the fine in article of the cao to azn the above-mentioned law no of may increased the administrative-detention sentence in article of the cao to up to one month the relevant extracts of resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe the honouring of obligations and commitments by azerbaijan read as follows regrettably there is no political dialogue with the opposition parties outside parliament the assembly is concerned by the restrictive climate for the activities of the extra-parliamentary opposition which complains about limitations imposed on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the lack of access to the public media the establishment of an inclusive political system and a truly competitive and unrestrictive political environment requires full implementation of basic freedoms including freedom of expression freedom of assembly and freedom of association the situation in azerbaijan is preoccupying and the assembly expresses its deep concern in this regard recently adopted amendments to the criminal code and the administrative code which have increased penalties for the organisers of and participants in unauthorised gatherings raise concern considering the authorities ongoing blanket ban on protests in the baku city centre these amendments are likely to have a further negative impact on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression the restrictive use of certain articles of the criminal code in particular articles and against participants in peaceful albeit unauthorised demonstrations is another matter of concern the relevant extracts of the report commdh of august by nils muižnieks the commissioner for human rights of the council of europe following his visit to azerbaijan from to may read as follows the commissioner is deeply concerned by the recent amendments to the law on freedom of assembly the criminal code and the code of administrative offences which further erode the right to freedom of assembly the sanctions which can now be imposed coupled with the fact that local authorities have not authorised a single rally in baku city centre in recent years clearly have a chilling effect on the organisation of or participation in demonstrations the commissioner is of the view that participants in peaceful assemblies should not be sanctioned for the mere fact of being present at and actively participating in the demonstration in question provided they do not do anything illegal violent or obscene in the course of it the commissioner therefore urges the authorities to ensure that no disproportionate sanction which would undermine the fundamental right to peaceful assembly is imposed for a summary of other relevant provisions concerning administrative proceedings the relevant provisions concerning the organisation and holding of public assemblies and the relevant extracts of international documents see the judgment in the case of gafgaz mammadov v. azerbaijan no october,case originated two applications nos republic azerbaijan lodged court article
