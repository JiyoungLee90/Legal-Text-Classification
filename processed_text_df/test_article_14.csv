anton gerard van raalte the commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby the recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the government s

as president of the chamber rule para mr ryssdal acting through the registrar consulted the agent of the government the applicant s lawyer and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the

decision the hearing took place in public in the human rights building on september the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court a for the government b for the commission c for the applicant the applicant is a netherlands national born in and resident in he has never been married and has no children on september the inspector of direct taxes sent the applicant an assessment of his contributions for the year under various social security schemes including the general child care benefits act algemene kinderbijslagwet see paragraph below the applicant filed an objection bezwaarschrift see paragraph below to this assessment on october he based his argument on section of the general child care benefits act and on the royal decree of february staatsblad official gazette no the royal decree see paragraph below by virtue of which unmarried childless women of years or over were exempted from the obligation to pay contributions under the general child care benefits act in his view the prohibition of discrimination such as was contained in article of the netherlands constitution see paragraph below and article of the international covenant on civil and political rights see paragraph below implied that this exemption should be extended to men in the same situation the applicant later received similar assessments for the years and against which he likewise filed objections the inspector reserved his decision on these pending the outcome of the proceedings relating to the assessment on november the inspector issued a decision declaring the first objection unfounded on the ground that under national legislation the application of section of the general child care benefits act is not possible since the person by whom the contributions are due is not female the applicant appealed to the amsterdam court of appeal see paragraph below on december relying on article of the convention taken together with article of protocol no art and article of the international covenant on civil and political rights he claimed that the provisions of the royal decree should be given a gender neutral construction section of the general child care benefits act and the royal decree were in his view discriminatory the inspector lodged a written defence thereafter the applicant filed a reply and the inspector a rejoinder the exemption enjoyed by unmarried childless women of or over from the obligation to pay contributions under the general child care benefits act was abolished by the act of december staatsblad no with effect from january the court of appeal gave its judgment on october dismissing the applicant s appeal and confirming the inspector s decision its reasoning included the following neither the wording of the impugned provision nor its drafting history indicates that the legislature intended to discriminate or has caused discrimination in particular it can not be said that the legislator wished to discriminate against unmarried men who had reached the age of before the beginning of the calendar year and were not entitled to child care benefits under the general child care benefits act vis-à-vis comparable women by means of the provision set out in section of the general child care benefits act the legislature merely wished to take due account of the difference in factual situation between women over and men over with regard to having begetting or raising children the fact as stated by the applicant that it appears from statistical data that older men only rarely beget children makes no difference to what is considered in paragraph above the legislature has assessed the factual situation of the group of women referred to in section of the general child care benefits act differently on the basis of the possibility of their having children and not on the basis of the reality of their having children older men s possibilities of procreating are fundamentally different from those of older women in the sense that this difference is considerable irrespective of these statistical data the difference in treatment opposed by the applicant is therefore not based on a difference in sex but on a difference in factual situation this conclusion is not altered by the fact that this difference partly coincides with the difference between the sexes the impugned provision does not therefore contravene the prohibition of discrimination it can not be excluded in principle that the fairness and acceptability of the general child care benefits act benefit by taking account of these differences in factual situation it not being for the court of appeal to rule on the intrinsic value of a statute the court can not consider whether the differences in factual situation entirely justify the exemption in question even if it were correct contrary to what is set out above that the impugned provision contravenes the prohibition of discrimination this would not benefit the applicant the court of appeal would not be at liberty to extend the exemption in question to one or more groups of individuals for whom the legislature definitely did not intend it if the argument based on prohibition of discrimination should have to be accepted in principle this could only lead to a finding that the impugned provision had no binding force this would not be in the applicant s interest the applicant filed an appeal on points of law beroep in cassatie see paragraph below to the supreme court hoge raad on december in so far as is relevant here he challenged the above reasoning of the court of appeal relying on article of the convention art and article of the international covenant on civil and political rights of the inspector responded in writing the supreme court dismissed the appeal on december its reasoning included the following the third ground of appeal middel argues that the principle set out in section of the general child care benefits act violates article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the convention art to the extent that the ground of appeal relies on the latter provision art it must fail as the present case does not relate to any of the rights and freedoms enumerated in the convention in view of inter alia the drafting history of the provision in question the limitation of the exemption set out in section of the general child care benefits act to women of and over was inspired by the idea that it would not be reasonable to levy contributions under the general child care benefits act from these women since it had to be assumed that a great number of them would never have children and were prevented by social and unlike men biological factors from ever bearing children the supreme court need not consider the question of whether the above-mentioned fact constitutes an objective and reasonable justification for exempting only women of and over from paying contributions under the general child care benefits act since this difference in treatment between unmarried women and men which in any case given their biological differences can not be said to lack all reasonable ground has been removed with effect from january by the abolition of the exemption by the act of december staatsblad no there is no reason for a court to intervene by declaring the exemption applicable for the year in question to unmarried men of and over after the delivery of this judgment the inspector issued decisions dismissing the applicant s objections to the assessments for the years and see paragraph above according to figures published by the netherlands central bureau for statistics centraal bureau voor de statistiek the number of legitimate children born alive in the netherlands to fathers aged or over in was or approximately of the total number of legitimate children born that year the corresponding figure for mothers aged or over was or approximately per thousand no figures are available for children born out of wedlock article of the constitution provides all persons present in the shall be treated in the same way in similar situations discrimination on the ground of religion philosophical convictions political leanings race sex or any other ground whatsoever shall not be allowed under constitutional law courts may not review the constitutionality of statutes article reads the courts shall not rule on the constitutionality grondwettigheid of statutes and treaties delegated legislation on the other hand may be examined to determine whether it conforms with the constitution and even with unwritten general principles of law see the judgment of the supreme court of december beslissingen in belastingzaken reports of decisions in taxation cases bnb no article of the constitution provides that provisions of international treaties and decisions of international intergovernmental organisations which according to their content may be binding on anyone shall have binding force after they have been published with regard to the prohibition of discrimination the is a party to inter alia the international covenant on civil and political rights of the covenant article of which provides as follows all persons are equal before the law and are entitled without discrimination to the equal protection of the law in this respect the law shall prohibit any discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status the general child care benefits act was enacted in until january see paragraph below section of the general child care benefits act provided as follows contributions are due by a every person by whom contributions are due by way of assessment under the general old age pensions act algemene ouderdomswet b the first paragraph under a may be derogated

netherlands under a contract of employment section of the general old age pensions act any person who was either a netherlands resident or subject to the wages tax deduction act in respect of work carried out in the netherlands under a contract of employment was entitled to benefits under the general child care benefits act for children for whose maintenance he or she was financially responsible whether they were his or her own by birth or marriage or foster children sections and of the general child care benefits act such entitlement was not subject to the condition that the person concerned had contributed to the scheme at the time of the events complained of the derogation from the general rule made possible by section was provided for by the royal decree of february staatsblad no section provided in derogation from section a of the general child care benefits act no contributions shall be due by an unmarried woman who has reached the age of before the beginning of the calendar year and who is not entitled to child care benefits under that act the supreme court recognised in its judgment of february nederlandse jurisprudentie netherlands law reports nj no corrected in nj no that article of the covenant is a provision of an international treaty which according to its content may be binding on anyone and must therefore in principle be applied directly by the courts see paragraph above however in a number of judgments it has declined to construe article of the covenant in such a way as to deprive national legislation of its effect even if it considered that a given measure constituted illegal discrimination between men and women holding that where various options were open to the national authorities to remove such discrimination the choice should be left to the legislature in view of the social and legal implications attending each possible course of action see the judgments of the supreme court of october nj no and october nj no in its

procedure rule para on november he directed that the said agent and representative should each have until february to file a memorial and that the delegate should be entitled to file within two months from the date of the transmission to him by the registrar of whichever of the aforesaid documents should last be filed a memorial in reply the president subsequently agreed to extend the government 's time-limit until march and the applicants until march the government 's memorial was filed with the registry on march and the applicants on march by letter of may the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would present his observations at the hearings on may the chamber decided under rule to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary court after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government the commission 's delegate and the applicants representative the president directed on may that the oral proceedings should open on september the hearings were held in public at the human rights building on the appointed day immediately before they opened the court had held a preparatory meeting there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicants the court heard addresses by lord rawlinson for the government by mr. carrillo for the commission and by mr. beloff for the applicants as well as their replies to questions put by the court and by several of its members on various dates between july and february the registry received from as the case may be the government the applicants or the commission replies to questions which the court had addressed on august to those appearing before it further memorials and observations and certain other documents the applicants are lawfully and permanently settled in the in accordance with the immigration rules in force at the material time mr. abdulaziz mr. cabales and mr. balkandali were refused permission to remain with or join them in that country as their husbands the applicants maintained that on this account they had been victims of a practice of discrimination on the grounds of sex race and also in the case of mrs. balkandali birth and that there had been violations of article art of the convention and of article art taken alone or in conjunction with article art they further alleged that contrary to article art no effective domestic remedy existed for the aforesaid claims the evolution of immigration controls in the united kingdom has to be seen in the light of the history of the british empire and the corresponding developments in nationality laws originally all persons born within or having a specified connection with the or the dominions owed allegiance to the crown and were british subjects a common british nationality was however difficult to reconcile with the independence of the self-governing countries of the commonwealth into which the empire was transformed as the various territories concerned became independent they introduced their own citizenship laws but for the purposes of law persons having the citizenship of an independent commonwealth country retained a special status known as british subject or commonwealth citizen these terms being synonymous this status was also held by citizens of the and colonies prior to january the latter citizenship was briefly acquired by birth within the united kingdom or one of its remaining dependencies by descent from a father having that citizenship by naturalisation or by registration british nationality act whereas aliens have been subject to continuing strict immigration controls over a long period the same is not true of commonwealth citizens until the latter irrespective of their local citizenship all had freedom to enter the for work and permanent residence without any restriction a rapid rise in the influx of immigrants especially in and and the consequent danger of the rate of immigration exceeding the country 's capacity to absorb them led to a radical change in this situation the commonwealth immigrants act and then the commonwealth immigrants act restricted the right of entry of and imposed immigration controls on certain classes of commonwealth citizens including citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who did not have close links to the existing immigration laws were amended and replaced by the immigration act the act which came into force on january one of its main purposes was to assimilate immigration controls over incoming commonwealth citizens having no close links to to the corresponding rules for aliens the act created two new categories of persons for immigration purposes namely those having the right of abode in the patrials and those not having that right non-patrials patrials were to be free from immigration controls the status of patrial was intended to designate commonwealth citizens who belonged to the and in summary was conferred by section of the act on a citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who had acquired that citizenship by birth adoption naturalisation or registration in the british islands that is the united kingdom the channel islands and the isle of man or were the children or grandchildren of any such persons b citizens of the united kingdom and colonies who had at any time been settled in the british islands for at least five years c other commonwealth citizens who were the children of a person having citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies by virtue of birth in the d women being commonwealth citizens who were or had been married to a man falling within any of the preceding categories under section of the act non-patrials whether commonwealth citizens or aliens may live work and settle in the united kingdom by permission and subject to such regulation and control of their entry into stay in and departure from the united kingdom as is imposed by the act subject to certain exceptions not relevant to the present case a non-patrial shall not enter the unless given leave to do so section he may be given such leave or if he is already in the country leave to remain either for a limited or for an indefinite period in the former case the leave may be subject to conditions restricting employment or requiring registration with the police or both ibid. where limited leave to enter or remain is granted it may subsequently be varied either as regards its duration or the conditions attaching thereto but if the limit on duration is removed any conditions attached to the leave cease to apply section the power to give or refuse leave to enter is exercised by immigration officers but the power to give or vary leave to remain can be exercised only by the home secretary section under section of the act the home secretary is obliged from time to time to lay before parliament statements of the rules or of any changes therein laid down by him as to the practice to be followed in the administration of the act for regulating entry into and stay in the these rules contain instructions to immigration officers as to how they shall exercise the statutory discretions given to them by the act and statements of the manner in which the home secretary will exercise his own powers of control after entry the rules are required to provide for the admission of persons coming for the purpose of taking employment or for the purposes of study or as visitors or as dependants of persons lawfully in or entering the united kingdom but uniform provision does not have to be made for these categories and in particular account may be taken of citizenship or nationality sections and thus different rules can be and are made for nationals of the member states of the european economic community under community law and irish citizens are in a special position the rules are subject to a negative resolution procedure whereby if a resolution disapproving the home secretary 's statement is passed by either house of parliament within forty days of its being laid he is required as soon as may be to make such changes as appear to him to be required in the circumstances and to lay the rules as amended before parliament within forty days of the passing of the resolution section the statement of rules thus amended is subject to the same procedure as the original statement because of the continuous nature of decision-making by immigration officers the statement originally laid is not abrogated by any negative resolution it will come into operation when made or on the date therein provided and will remain in force until replaced the exact legal status of the rules is of some complexity this question was considered by the court of appeal in r. v. secretary of state for the home department ex parte hosenball all england law reports when lord denning mr said the home secretary 's rules are not rules of law they are rules of practice laid down for the guidance of immigration officers and tribunals who are entrusted with the administration of the act they can be and often are prayed in aid by applicants before the courts in immigration cases to some extent the courts must have regard to them because there are provisions in the act itself particularly in section which show that in appeals to an adjudicator if the immigration rules have not been complied with then the appeal is to be allowed in addition the courts always have regard to those rules not only in matters where there is a right of appeal but also in cases under prerogative writs where there is a question whether officers have acted fairly but they are not rules in the nature of delegated legislation so as to amount to strict rules of law also doubted whether the rules constituted delegated legislation he observed these rules are very difficult to categorise or classify they are in a class of their own they are certainly a practical guide for immigration officers .... indeed they are as to large parts little more than explanatory notes of the act itself however he noted that if parliament disapproved of the rules they were not thereby abrogated furthermore at least as far as an adjudicator dealing with appeals was concerned the rules had the force of law although it seemed that they could be departed from with the consent of the applicant himself lord justice cumming-bruce said the rules are a totally different kind of publication from the rules that usually come into being under the authority delegated to ministers under acts of parliament they are not in my view in any sense of themselves of legislative force it is true that the rules are given legal effect in the field of the appellate process to the adjudicator or the tribunal .... but the legal effect that the rules have in that limited field flows not from the fact that they have been published by the minister and laid before parliament but because by section of the act the rules are given an effect which is in a certain field clearly legally enforceable and that is a quite different matter notwithstanding that an application for entry clearance see paragraph b below or leave to enter or remain may fall to be refused under the relevant immigration rules the home secretary has a discretion deriving from historic prerogative powers to authorise in exceptional circumstances the grant of entry clearance or of leave to enter or to allow a person to remain in the united kingdom where the applicant is a husband seeking to join or remain with his wife settled in the united kingdom factors which the home secretary will consider include the extent of her ties with that country and of the hardship she might suffer by going to live abroad and any recommendations by the immigration appellate authorities see paragraphs below the rules in force at the time of the events giving rise to the present case were contained in the statement of changes in immigration rules hc laid before parliament on february the rules they applied to all decisions taken on or after march except those relating to applications made on or before november a draft of the rules had previously been included in a white paper published in november the rules which in paragraph instructed immigration officers to carry out their duties without regard to the race colour or religion of the intending entrant detailed firstly the controls to be exercised on the entry into the of non-patrials and then those to be exercised after entry the former depended on whether the individual concerned was coming for temporary purposes for example visitors or students for employment or business or as a person of independent means or for settlement as under the rules previously in force visitors were normally to be prohibited from taking employment and persons wishing to come for employment were subject to strict regulations as to work permits the work-permit requirements however did not apply to nationals of other member states of the european economic community nor to persons covered by the united kingdom ancestry rule under the latter rule which had been in force since the act came into operation a commonwealth citizen having a grandparent born in the british islands and wishing to take or seek employment in the united kingdom could obtain indefinite leave to enter even without a work permit a further exception was to be found in the working holiday rule whereby young commonwealth citizens could without a permit take employment incidental to an extended holiday being spent in the however the period of their stay could under the rules not exceed two years all these exceptions have been maintained in subsequent immigration rules a particular feature of the changes introduced by the rules was the inclusion of a number of provisions directed towards implementing a policy of protecting the domestic labour market at a time of high unemployment by curtailing primary immigration that is immigration by someone who could be expected to seek full-time work in order to support a family in taking these measures the government were concerned also to advance public tranquillity and by exercising firm and fair immigration control to assist in securing good community relations to these ends among the changes effected was the introduction of stricter conditions for the grant of leave to a non-patrial husband or fiancé seeking to join or remain with his wife or fiancée settled in the previously any such husband or fiancé would normally have been allowed to settle after a qualifying period provided that the primary purpose of the marriage was not to obtain settlement in that country these new measures were not extended to the wives and fiancées of settled men a fact attributed by the government to long-standing commitments based allegedly on humanitarian social and ethical reasons to the reunification of the families of male immigrants nor did the new measures apply to nationals of other member states of the european economic community the relevant provisions of the rules and of their successors are summarised below in terms of the following expressions a a person is settled in the united kingdom when he or she is ordinarily resident there without having entered or remained in breach of the immigration laws and is free from any restriction on the period for which he or she may remain paragraph b an entry clearance paragraphs is a document either a visa an entry certificate or a home office letter of consent depending on the nationality of the person concerned which is to be taken by an immigration officer as evidence that the holder although a non-patrial is eligible under the immigration rules for entry to the united kingdom it is obtained at british missions abroad or from the home office prior to arrival in the c a marriage or intended marriage is non-qualifying if there is reason to believe that its primary purpose is to obtain admission to or settlement in the or the parties do not intend to live together permanently as man and wife or the parties have not met paragraphs and d there is potential evasion of the rules if there is reason to believe that a husband has remained in the united kingdom in breach of the immigration rules before the marriage that the marriage has taken place after a decision or recommendation that he be deported or that the marriage has terminated paragraph e the financial requirement is a requirement that varies according to the circumstances of the particular case basically it means that adequate maintenance and accommodation must be available to the person concerned without the need for recourse to public funds paragraphs and where a non-patrial whose spouse or intended spouse was settled in the united kingdom came to that country for settlement he or she would be admitted for that purpose provided that he or she held a current entry clearance and unless the circumstances specified in paragraph of the rules obtained for example false representations medical grounds criminal record exclusion would be conducive to the public good a where the intending entrant was a husband or fiancé he could under paragraphs and obtain an entry clearance i unless the marriage or intended marriage was non-qualifying ii if his wife or fiancée was a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who or one of whose parents had been born in the and iii if in the cases of fiancés only the financial requirement was satisfied b where the intending entrant was a wife or fiancée she could under paragraphs and obtain an entry clearance irrespective of the nationality of her husband or fiancé or of his own or his parents place of birth here there was no provision as to non-qualifying marriages but the financial requirement had generally to be satisfied c wives admitted under these rules would be given indefinite leave to enter husbands would be initially admitted for twelve months and fiancés or fiancées for three months with the possibility subject to certain safeguards of applying subsequently to the home office for indefinite leave paragraphs and non-patrials already admitted to the united kingdom in a temporary capacity who subsequently married a person settled in the could also obtain permission to stay a where the non-patrial seeking permission was a man the basic conditions paragraph were that i his wife was a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who or one of whose parents had been born in the and ii the marriage was not non-qualifying and there was not potential evasion of the rules b where the non-patrial seeking permission was a woman she would normally be granted leave to remain on application paragraph c leave to remain granted under these rules would be for wives indefinite and for husbands for an initial period of twelve months with the possibility subject again to the conditions referred to in sub-paragraph a ii above of subsequent removal of the time-limit paragraphs and decisions on applications for leave to remain were taken in the light of all relevant facts thus even where the individual satisfied the formal requirements permission would normally be refused if the circumstances specified in paragraph of the rules obtained for example false representations non-compliance with the time-limit or conditions subject to which he or she had been admitted or given leave to remain undesirable character danger to national security one result of the act was that the right of abode in the united kingdom became divorced from nationality thus a number of citizens of the united kingdom and colonies did not have that right for example because they had not been born in the british islands see paragraph a above whereas it was enjoyed by a number of persons who were not such citizens for example commonwealth citizens having an ancestral link with the united kingdom see paragraph c above with a view to bringing citizenship and immigration laws into line the position was substantially amended by the british nationality act which came into force on january so far as is relevant for the present purposes that act a replaced citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies see paragraph in fine above with three separate citizenships british and british overseas b provided in section that on january british citizenship was to be acquired by persons who were then citizens of the united kingdom and colonies and had the right of abode in the united kingdom under the act this category could include a person who was neither born nor had a parent born in the united kingdom see paragraph b above c laid down detailed provisions on the acquisition of british citizenship by persons born after january d contained in section and schedule detailed provisions on naturalisation as a british citizen on the basis of residence in the the grant of a certificate of naturalisation being at the discretion of the home secretary e amended the act by providing in section that the right of abode in the united kingdom use of the expressions patrial and non-patrial was abandoned and the consequential freedom from immigration controls were in future to be enjoyed only by british citizens and by such commonwealth citizens as on december had the right of abode under the act on december after debates in the house of commons and the house of lords the home secretary laid before parliament a statement of changes in immigration rules hc the rules intended to harmonise the immigration rules with the british nationality act and expressed to come into force on january however on december the house of commons passed a resolution disapproving the statement some members finding the changes too lax and others insufficient since by january no further changes had been laid before parliament the rules came into force on that date notwithstanding the negative resolution see paragraph above the rules made no changes to the regime governing wives and fiancées described in paragraphs above the regime governing a husband or fiancé was modified in the following main respects a the requirement that for him to be eligible for leave to enter or remain his wife or fiancée had to be a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies born or having a parent born in the united kingdom was under paragraphs and replaced by a requirement that she be a british citizen the place of her own or her parents birth ceased to be material since british citizens could include persons without the territorial birth link for example a woman born in a former colony but having the right of abode in the united kingdom by virtue of long residence there see paragraphs b and b above b by virtue of paragraphs and the onus of proof was reversed so that it became for the man seeking leave to enter or remain to show that the marriage was not non-qualifying or in cases to which paragraph applied that there was not potential evasion of the rules c leave to remain for settlement following marriage granted to a man admitted in a temporary capacity cf paragraph c above would be for an initial period of twelve months followed by a further period of twelve months and then by the possibility subject again to the conditions referred to in sub-paragraph b above of subsequent removal of the time-limit paragraph no provision was made in the rules for women settled in the who were not british citizens to be joined by their husbands although leave could be granted by the home secretary in the exercise of his extra-statutory discretion see paragraph above these women could also apply for naturalisation as british citizens on the basis of residence under section of the british nationality act see paragraph d above on february a further statement of changes in immigration rules hc the rules was laid before parliament a motion disapproving these rules was defeated in the house of commons and they came into force on february the rules again did not modify the regime governing wives and fiancées that governing husbands was amended so far as is material to the present case in that under paragraph the position concerning the length of leave to remain granted to a man already in the united kingdom reverted to that obtaining under the rules that is initial leave of twelve months followed by the possibility of indefinite leave see paragraph c above this change was coupled with a transitional provision paragraph concerning men who whilst the rules were in force see paragraph c above had been granted thereunder an extension of stay for a second period of twelve months they were entitled to apply immediately for indefinite leave without awaiting the expiry of that period there was no change in the position concerning women settled in the who were not british citizens described in paragraph above under sections a and b of the act a person not having the right of abode in the united kingdom and having only limited leave to enter or remain in that country who overstays the period of leave or fails to observe a condition attached thereto a commits a criminal offence punishable with a fine of not more than or imprisonment of not more than six months or both to which penalties the court may with certain exceptions add a recommendation for deportation and b is with certain exceptions liable to deportation although he can not be compelled to leave unless the home secretary decides to make a deportation order against him appellate authorities in immigration matters were established by the immigration appeals act they consist of a adjudicators who sit alone and are appointed by the home secretary b the immigration appeal tribunal which sits in divisions of at least three members the members are appointed by the lord chancellor and a certain number must be lawyers there is no further right of appeal as such to the ordinary courts but decisions of the appellate authorities are susceptible to judicial review by the high court on the ground of such matters as error of law or unreasonableness judicial review of immigration decisions may also cover questions of an abuse or excess of power by the home secretary or whether an immigration officer acted impartially and fairly under sections and of the act an appeal may subject to certain exceptions be made to an adjudicator against inter alia a refusal of leave to enter the or of an entry clearance b variation of or refusal to vary a limited leave to remain in the c a decision to make a deportation order an appellant shall not be required to leave the by reason of the expiration of his leave so long as his appeal is pending against a refusal to enlarge or remove the limit on the duration of the leave however no appeal lies against refusal of an extension of leave to remain if application therefor was made after expiry of the existing leave except as otherwise provided by the act an adjudicator is under section to allow an appeal only if he considers a that the decision or action in question was not in accordance with the law or any immigration rules applicable to the case or b that where the decision or action involved the exercise of a discretion by the home secretary or an officer that discretion should have been exercised differently if however the decision or action is in accordance with the rules the adjudicator may not review a refusal by the home secretary of a request by the person concerned that he should depart from the rules section where an appeal is allowed the adjudicator must give such directions for giving effect to his decision as he thinks requisite and may also make further recommendations the directions are binding on the home secretary except so long as an appeal to the immigration appeal tribunal can be brought or is pending sections and any party to an appeal to an adjudicator may appeal against his decision to the immigration appeal tribunal which may affirm that decision or make any other decision which the adjudicator could have made it also has similar duties and powers in the matter of directions and recommendations as the law stood at the relevant time leave to appeal had generally to be obtained it had to be granted inter alia if determination of the appeal turned upon an arguable point of law section of the act and rule of the immigration appeals procedure rules a the government estimated total immigration into the united kingdom from the new commonwealth that is the commonwealth except australia canada and at in the period from to it was thought that by the latter date some million people had the right of abode see paragraphs above in the between and the end of a further people were estimated to have settled in that country from the new commonwealth and pakistan some from non-commonwealth countries other than pakistan and some from the old commonwealth australia canada and new zealand relatively few countries were said to have accounted for most of this immigration the official estimates for show that the population of the united kingdom million included million persons of new commonwealth and pakistan origin of whom about million were in the greater london area and million other persons not born in the united kingdom including those born in the old commonwealth but not those born in the republic of ireland it is estimated that the population of new commonwealth and pakistan origin could rise to million by and million per cent of the projected total population by b according to the government some persons entered the united kingdom annually under the ancestry rule see paragraph above but many of them emigrated after a few years c in there was an average net annual emigration from the united kingdom of about but the population density in persons per square kilometer or persons per square kilometer for england alone was higher than that of any other of the european communities d statistics supplied by the government showed that in great britain in per cent of all men of working age and per cent of all women of working age were economically active that is either in employment or self-employed or unemployed the corresponding figures for persons coming from the indian sub-continent were per cent for men and per cent for women and for persons coming from the west indies or per cent for men and per cent for women the statistics also disclosed that a considerably higher proportion of economically active women particularly married women than men were in part-time employment only per cent of married women compared with per cent of men recent years have seen a high level of unemployment in the in per cent of economically active men and per cent of economically active women were unemployed as measured by official figures based on persons claiming unemployment benefit there was a marked increase between and when the figures rose from to per cent and from to per cent respectively e the government also produced to the court detailed statistics in support of their claim that the overall effect of the rules had been to lead to an annual reduction of up to rather than as they had estimated before the commission in the number of husbands either accepted for settlement or applying successfully to come for settlement from all parts of the world they recognised however that part though not a major part of this figure might represent a decrease attributable to economic conditions in their submission this reduction was of a considerable scale when viewed in relation to the figures for the total number of persons accepted for settlement into the the latter figures about one-half of which were in each year accounted for by wives and children of men already settled in the country were over in and in around in each year from to in in and in the number of men accepted for settlement by reason of marriage was in in in in in in in in and in the number of women so accepted was in in in in in in and in the claimed reduction of per annum was questioned by the applicants on the following grounds it was based on a comparison with the figures for a year in which the number of applications from the indian sub-continent was artificially high in order to take account of the delays in processing applications and the twelve-month waiting-period before indefinite leave to remain would be granted a more meaningful comparison would be between the and the figures no account was taken of the natural decline in applications and no account was taken of persons properly excluded for example on the ground that the marriage was not genuine mrs. nargis abdulaziz is permanently and lawfully resident in the with the right to remain indefinitely she was born in in and brought up in that country her parents were also born there according to her she was a citizen of at birth but being of indian origin was subsequently deprived of that citizenship and is now stateless she holds a malawian travel document this applicant went to the on december she was given leave as a non-patrial see paragraphs above to enter as a visitor leave which was subsequently extended on three occasions since special vouchers had been allocated to members of her family enabling them to settle in the an application was made on her behalf for indefinite leave to remain on may as an act of discretion outside the immigration rules see paragraph above she was given such leave essentially on the ground that she was an unmarried woman with little prospect of marriage who formed part of a close family including her father and mother settled in the united kingdom mr. ibramobai abdulaziz is a portuguese national who was born in daman a former portuguese territory in in he emigrated to in on october he was admitted as a non-patrial to the for six months as a visitor he met the applicant six days later and they became engaged to be married on november they were married on december and during the following week mrs. abdulaziz applied for leave for her husband to remain permanently in the shortly afterwards the joint council for the welfare of immigrants also applied for leave for him to remain for a period of twelve months after mr. and mrs. abdulaziz had been interviewed at the home office on june her application was refused on july on the ground that she was not a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who or one of whose parents had been born in the united kingdom paragraph of the rules see paragraph a i above abdulaziz appealed to an adjudicator see paragraphs above against this decision but the appeal was dismissed on october as he did not qualify for leave to remain under the rules the adjudicator pointed out that had the application been made before november or the decision taken before march mr. abdulaziz would have been admitted under the previous rules see paragraphs and above leave to appeal to the immigration appeal tribunal was refused by the tribunal on december on the ground that the determination of the appeal did not turn on any arguable point of law and that leave to appeal was not otherwise merited see paragraph above subsequently mr. abdulaziz remained and still remains in the without leave he is currently employed as a chef in a restaurant his wife does not work a son was born to the couple in october representations through members of parliament to the home office have been rejected basically on the ground that the couple could live together in portugal and that the circumstances of the case were not such as to warrant exceptional treatment in a letter of february to one member the minister of state at the home office indicated that the authorities would shortly be advising mr. abdulaziz to depart without delay adding that if he did not consideration will have to be given to enforcing his departure however a letter of november to another member stated that the minister did not propose for the time being to take any action regarding mr. abdulaziz 's removal in fact the authorities have not to date instituted any criminal or deportation proceedings see paragraph above against him their decision according to the government was taken in the light of all the circumstances including the commission 's decision on the admissibility of mrs. abdulaziz 's application see paragraph below the couple 's situation has not until now been changed by the or the rules since mrs. abdulaziz although settled in the is not a british citizen see paragraphs above she has however applied on august for naturalisation as such a citizen under section of the british nationality act see paragraph d above at the home office interview mr. abdulaziz said that his wife could not be expected to live in because she had always been close to her family and because her sick father who in fact died in september needed her company before the commission and the court she claimed that her health was under strain because of her husband 's settlement problems and that humanitarian considerations prevented her going to portugal a country where she had no family and whose language she did not speak the government maintain that there is no obstacle whatever to her going with her husband to live in mrs. arcely cabales is permanently and lawfully resident in the with the right to remain indefinitely she was born in the in and was brought up there and is of asian origin she had the nationality of that country until see paragraph below her parents were born and live in the this applicant went to the united kingdom in with a work permit for employment as a nursing assistant and was admitted as a non-patrial see paragraphs above for twelve months she remained in approved work thereafter and on june the conditions attached to her stay were removed and she was allowed to remain in the indefinitely she is now employed and has an established career as a state-enrolled nurse mr. ludovico cabales is a citizen of the born in that country in he met the applicant in in when she was on holiday and again in when she was there for one or two months during the latter period the couple became engaged on april they went through a ceremony of marriage in the the applicant returned to the shortly afterwards to take up her job again in may she informed the home office of the marriage and applied for leave for mr. cabales to enter the a request which she repeated in august on november he being a non-patrial applied to the british embassy in for a visa to join his wife for settlement in the after mrs. cabales had supplied certain further information requested by it the home office wrote to her on february to advise her that the visa application had been refused on the ground that she was not a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who or one of whose parents had been born in the united kingdom paragraph of the rules see paragraph a ii above notice of the decision was not handed to mr. cabales until november as he had failed to respond to an invitation of march to attend at the manila embassy for that purpose on august the joint council for the welfare of immigrants wrote to the home office immigration and nationality department seeking a review of this decision however on january the department having considered the circumstances informed the council of its decision to maintain the refusal mr. cabales had on december lodged an appeal with an adjudicator see paragraphs above against the decision but the appeal was dismissed on july on the ground that the visa officer 's decision was in accordance with the law and the immigration rules the adjudicator who noted that mrs. cabales had not taken legal advice but had thought at the time of the marriage ceremony that a forthcoming change in the law would allow mr. cabales to be admitted expressed the hope that the authorities would look at the case sympathetically this was not initially recognised by the authorities as a recommendation but the home secretary subsequently concluded that there were not sufficient grounds for acting outside the immigration rules there is no record of an application for leave to appeal to the immigration appeal tribunal representations to the home office were also rejected basically on the ground that the couple could live together in the and that there were not sufficient reasons for the home secretary to exercise his extra-statutory discretion between april and december mr. cabales continued to live in the and the couple were separated apart from a short period in when mrs. cabales visited that country however following an application made by her in november under section of the british nationality act see paragraph d above mrs. cabales obtained naturalisation as a british citizen with effect from april she thereby lost her philippine citizenship on july mr. cabales applied for entry clearance for permanent settlement as the husband of a british citizen under paragraph of the rules see paragraphs above for the reasons and in the circumstances indicated in the following paragraph this application was refused on october but on the following day mr. cabales applied for and was granted a visa entitling him to enter the for three months for the purposes of marriage he arrived in that country on december and the parties were married there on january on february he was granted leave to remain as a husband for the next twelve months on the expiry of that period he will be eligible to apply for indefinite leave in a memorial filed with the court on july the government questioned the validity of the marriage see paragraph above under articles and of the philippine civil code a marriage solemnised without a licence was to be considered void save in the case of a marriage of exceptional character that is one between persons who have lived together as husband and wife for at least five years article the cabales marriage contract recited that the ceremony the couple went through in had been performed without a licence under article the parties had stated in a contemporaneous affidavit that they had previously cohabited for at least five years but according to mrs. cabales version of the facts this could not be so since she had not met mr. cabales until see paragraph above according to the government the requirements of article were therefore not satisfied and the marriage thus had to be considered void at the hearings on september the applicant 's counsel expressed the view that assuming a defect existed it was purely formal and the status of mr. and mrs. cabales could be regarded as akin to that of the parties to a common-law marriage her representative subsequently filed with the court details of the advice he had received from philippine lawyers to the effect that under the law of that country the marriage was to be presumed valid unless and until it was declared void by a court the government replied that they had been advised that the marriage was void ab initio and that no judicial decree was necessary to establish its invalidity this opinion was contradicted in further advice obtained on behalf of mrs. cabales and mrs. cabales were interviewed by the authorities in august and september they adduced no evidence to alter the government 's conclusion that the marriage was void however mrs. cabales stated that if mr. cabales were admitted to the the couple would go through a ceremony of marriage in that country it was in these circumstances that in october mr. cabales was refused leave to settle as a husband but was regarded as eligible under the rules for leave to enter the temporarily as the fiancé of a british citizen before the commission and the court mrs. cabales submitted that there would have been real obstacles to her returning to live in the she was too old her qualifications were not recognised there and by working in the she was able to support financially her parents and other members of her family these claims were contested by the government in particular on the ground that it was unrealistic to suppose that her nursing skills could not be put to good use in the mrs. sohair balkandali is permanently and lawfully resident in the with the right to remain indefinitely she was born in in or her parents were born and live in that country this applicant first went to the in november and was given leave as a non-patrial see paragraphs above to enter as a visitor for one month subsequently she obtained several further leaves to remain as a visitor or a student the last being until august she has a high level of university education in she married a mr. corbett a citizen of the and colonies and five days later was given indefinite leave to remain in the by virtue of her marriage under the provisions then in force on october again by virtue of her marriage she obtained registration as a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies under the british nationality act as a result of which she became a patrial see paragraphs in fine and a above at that time she was already separated from mr. corbett and the marriage was dissolved in october mr. bekir balkandali is a turkish national born in on april in january he was granted leave as a non-patrial to enter the apparently as a visitor for one month subsequently he obtained leave to remain as a student until march his application of april for an extension of this leave was refused on september because he had not attended his course of studies and the home secretary was not satisfied that he was a genuine student who intended to leave the country on their conclusion since his application for an extension had been made after his leave had expired he had no right of appeal under the act see paragraph above he was advised to leave the united kingdom and warned of the risk of criminal or deportation proceedings see paragraph above if he did not since the autumn of the applicant had been living with mr. balkandali in april they had a son who has the right of abode in the on october an application was made by the joint council for the welfare of immigrants for leave for mr. balkandali to remain in the until he married his fiancée the applicant they were interviewed together by home office officials on march and produced evidence of their marriage which had been celebrated in january the application was therefore treated as one to remain as the husband of a woman settled in the leave was refused on may on the ground that mrs. balkandali was not a citizen of the united kingdom and colonies who or one of whose parents had been born in the united kingdom paragraph of the rules see paragraph a i above there was no right of appeal against this decision as mr. balkandali had no current leave to remain at the time when his application was made see paragraph above representations through a member of parliament to the home office were rejected basically on the ground that the couple could live together in and that there were not sufficient compelling compassionate circumstances to warrant exceptional treatment outside the immigration rules in a letter of december to the member the minister of state at the home office wrote that mr. balkandali should now make arrangements to leave the united kingdom forthwith otherwise arrangements will be made to enforce his departure however a letter of december to the member stated that the minister did not propose for the time being to take any action against mr. balkandali in fact the authorities did not at any time institute criminal or deportation proceedings see paragraph above against him their decision according to the government was taken in the light of all the circumstances including the commission 's decision on the admissibility of mrs. balkandali 's application see paragraph below on january as the husband of a british citizen mr. balkandali was given twelve months leave to remain in the united kingdom in accordance with paragraph of the rules see paragraph a above this was possible because on january mrs. balkandali had automatically acquired british citizenship by virtue of the british nationality act see paragraph b above mr. balkandali subsequently applied for indefinite leave to remain and this was granted on january under paragraph of the rules see paragraph above in september he was working in the catering business and planned shortly to open a restaurant his wife was working two days a week in a creche before the commission and the court mrs. balkandali submitted that there would have been real obstacles to her going with her husband to live in turkey she cited her strong ties to the united kingdom and alleged that as an educated woman and the mother of an illegitimate child she would have been treated as a social outcast in turkey the government maintain that there were no real obstacles the application of mrs. abdulaziz no was lodged with the commission on december and those of mrs. cabales no and mrs. balkandali no on august each applicant claimed to be the victim of a practice authorised by parliament and contained in the rules which practice was incompatible with the convention and alleged violations of article art article art taken alone and in conjunction with article art and article art on may the commission declared the three applications admissible and ordered their joinder in pursuance of rule of its rules of procedure in its report adopted on may article art the commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of article in conjunction with article art on the ground of sexual discrimination unanimously that there had been no violation of the same articles art on the ground of racial discrimination nine votes to three that the original application of the rules in the case of mrs. balkandali constituted discrimination on the ground of birth contrary to article in conjunction with article art eleven votes with one abstention that the absence of effective domestic remedies for the applicants claims under articles and art art art constituted a violation of article art eleven votes to one that it was not necessary to pursue a further examination of the matter in the light of articles and art art the full text of the commission 's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment at the hearings on september the government submitted that mrs. cabales application was inadmissible ratione materiae in other respects they maintained in substance the submissions set out in their memorial of march whereby they had requested the court with regard to articles and art art with regard to article art to decide and declare that the facts of these cases are not capable of amounting alternatively do not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment under that article art to decide and declare that article art has no application to these cases since the complaints fall outside the scope of articles and art art art in any event to hold that as regards the immigration rules there is no obligation to provide a domestic remedy under that article art alternatively to hold that insofar as article art does impose on the facts any obligation to provide a domestic remedy in relation to any of the matters complained of that obligation is fulfilled the applicants for their part maintained in substance the submissions set out in their memorial of march whereby they had requested the court to decide and declare that the applicants are victims of a practice in violation of their right to respect for family life contrary to article art of the convention that they are further victims of a practice of discrimination in the securement of their said right that such discrimination constituted degrading treatment contrary to article art of the convention that the absence of effective remedies for the applicants claims under articles and art art art constituted a violation of article art of the

the case of kjeldsen busk madsen and pedersen was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights hereinafter referred to as the commission the case originated in three applications nos and against the kingdom of denmark lodged with the commission in and by viking and annemarie kjeldsen arne and inger busk madsen and hans and ellen pedersen all parents of danish nationality the joinder of the said applications was ordered by the commission on july the commission s request to which was attached the report provided for under article art of the convention was filed with the registry of the court on july within the period of three months laid down by articles para and art art the request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration made on april by the recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the purpose of the commission s request is to obtain a decision from the court as to whether or not the facts of the case disclose a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under article of the protocol of march hereinafter referred to as protocol no it also makes reference to articles and art art art of the convention on july in the presence of the registrar the president of the court drew by lot the names of five of the seven judges called upon to sit as members of the chamber mrs. h. pedersen the elected judge of danish nationality and mr. g. balladore pallieri the president of the court were ex officio members under article art of the convention and rule para b of the rules of court respectively one of the members of the chamber namely mr. j. cremona was subsequently prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case he was replaced by the first substitute judge mr. m. zekia balladore pallieri assumed the office of president of the chamber in accordance with rule para the president of the chamber ascertained through the registrar the views of the agent of the government of the hereinafter referred to as the government and of the delegates of the commission regarding the procedure to be followed by an order of september the president of the chamber decided that the government should file a memorial within a time-limit expiring on december and that the delegates of the commission should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the government s memorial on november the agent of the government advised the registrar of his intention to contest the jurisdiction of the court in the present case in accordance with the leave granted by the president of the chamber the government s memorial filed with the registry on november dealt exclusively with this preliminary question the government referred therein to the declaration whereby on april they recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court ipso facto and without special agreement in respect of any other contracting party to the convention accepting the same obligations subject to reciprocity in conclusion they submitted i that the said declaration is expressly limited to cases brought before the court by another ii that such limitation of the scope of declarations made under article art is not excluded either by the provision or by the structure of the convention iii that in any event the government can not be held to be subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the court beyond the express wording of their declaration emphasising in addition that they had not accepted ad hoc the jurisdiction of the court as regards the instant case article of the convention art the government invited the court to find that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the present cases by a message received at the registry on january the agent of the government informed the registrar that following a debate the previous day in the danish parliament his government had decided to withdraw with immediate effect their preliminary objection thus accepting ad hoc the jurisdiction of the court at a meeting in on january the chamber took cognisance of the said message and instructed the president to advise the government that formal note thereof had been taken this task the president discharged by means of an order of january the chamber noted that its jurisdiction was henceforth established for the case at issue whether on the basis of the special consent expressed in that message or by virtue of the general declaration made by the on april under article art of the convention as the delegates of the commission contended in a memorial filed with the registry on january by the same order of january the president of the chamber settled the written procedure as regards the merits of the case having consulted through the registrar the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission in this connection he decided that the government should file a memorial not later than march and that the delegates of the commission should be entitled to file a memorial in reply within two months of receipt of the government s memorial the government s memorial was received at the registry on march that of the delegates on may on march the president of the chamber instructed the registrar to invite the commission to produce certain documents which were communicated to the registry on march after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government and the delegates of the commission the president of the chamber decided by an order of may that the oral hearings should open on june in a telegram of may addressed to the commission s principal delegate mr. and mrs. kjeldsen declared that they withdrew their application the secretary to the commission notified the registrar of this on may he specified at the same time that having considered the matter the commission had decided to request the court not to strike the application out of its list and mrs. kjeldsen in addition wrote directly to the registrar on and may in their letters which were drafted in somewhat violent terms they gave as the explanation for their discontinuance the far-reaching divergences between their own arguments and those of the applicants busk madsen and pedersen as they objected to the commission s having ordered the joinder of the three applications they requested the court in the alternative to postpone the hearings until a later date and to examine their case separately on and may and then on june the government communicated several documents to the court the oral hearings were held in public at the on and june there appeared before the court for the government for the commission the court heard addresses by mr. welter and mr. frowein for the commission and by mr. spang-hanssen for the government as well as their replies to questions put by the court the applicants who are parents of danish nationality reside in mr. viking kjeldsen a galvaniser and his wife annemarie a schoolteacher live in varde mr. arne busk madsen a clergyman and his wife inger a schoolteacher come from åbenrå mr. hans pedersen who is a clergyman and mrs. ellen pedersen have their home in ålborg all three couples having children of school age object to integrated and hence compulsory sex education as introduced into state primary schools in by act no of may amending the state schools act lov om ændring af lov om folkeskolen hereinafter referred to as the act primary education in general according to article of the danish constitution all children have the right to free education in the state primary schools folkeskolen although parents are not obliged to enrol them there and may send them to a private school or instruct them at home during the school year a total of pupils were attending schools of which were private with pupils some parents chose to educate their children at home at the time of the facts at issue primary education in state schools was governed by the state schools act lov om folkeskolen a consolidated version of which was set out in executive order no of july which had been amended on various occasions between and primary education lasted for nine years a tenth year as well as a pre-school year for children of five to six years were voluntary the subjects taught in the first four years were danish writing arithmetic knowledge of christianity kristendomskundskab history geography biology physical training music creative art and needlework in the fifth and sixth years english and woodwork were added and in the seventh year german mathematics natural sciences and domestic science as from the eighth year the pupils were to some extent allowed to choose from these courses the subjects they preferred under the act the minister of education determined the objectives of schooling and the local school authorities fixed the contents of the curriculum and the number of lessons there were however two exceptions to this rule firstly religious instruction was to be in conformity with the evangelical lutheran doctrine of the but children might be exempted therefrom secondly the legislator had directed schools to include in their curricula often in conjunction with traditional subjects certain new topics such as road safety civics hygiene and sex education the administration of state schools in is largely decentralised these institutions are run by the municipal council the highest education authority in each of the some municipalities in that country as well as by a school commission and a school board the school commission skolekommissionen is as a general rule composed of eleven members of whom six are elected by the municipal council and five by the parents the commission in consultation with the teachers council and within the limits laid down by law prepares the curriculum for the schools within its district the curriculum must be approved by the municipal council to assist these bodies in the performance of their tasks the minister of education issues guidelines prepared by the state schools curriculum committee hereinafter referred to as the curriculum committee set up in each state school has a school board skolenævn which comprises three or five members one member is chosen by the municipal council the two or four others by the parents the board supervises the school and organises co-operation between school and parents it decides upon recommendation from the teachers council what teaching aids and in particular what books are to be used by the school and it also determines the distribution of lessons among the teachers primary education at private schools or at home must not fall below the standards laid down for state schools it must cover the same compulsory subjects and be of comparable quality while a school may be established without any advance approval it is subsequently supervised by the school commissions in order to ensure in particular that adequate instruction is given in danish writing and arithmetic the same applies to education given in the home if the school commission finds twice in succession that such teaching is inadequate the parents are required to send the child to a state or private school the state supports private schools provided that they have not less than twenty pupils in all and not less than ten pupils per class the state subsidises per cent of their running costs principal s and teachers salaries maintenance of buildings heating electricity water cleaning insurance etc. in addition private schools may be granted government loans on favourable terms for construction and improvement of buildings as a result parents who enrol their children at a private school do not in general have to bear school fees in excess of kroner per child per annum during the school year their average expenditure scarcely exceeded kroner the danish parliament voted in may in favour of a proposal which would oblige municipalities to bear a large proportion of the cost of transport for children attending private schools the statistics on private schools show that in the school year there were about seventy free schools one hundred and one private grammar schools without special religious background twenty-five catholic schools nineteen german minority schools ten schools for members of other religious societies eight christian free schools and some thirty-five other schools the applicants claim that there are insufficient private schools and that their pupils frequently have to travel long distances to attend them moreover parents wishing to send their children to a private school in have to enter them on waiting lists at least three years in advance sex education in sex education in state schools has been a topic of discussion for thirty-five years as early as sex education was introduced in the state schools of and several institutions outside the capital copied this example nevertheless the minister of education spoke against compulsory sex education when the question was raised in in the curriculum committee published a guide to teaching in state schools which distinguished between instruction on the reproduction of man and sex education proper the committee recommended that the former be integrated in the biology syllabus while the latter should remain optional for children and teachers and be provided by medical staff the committee also advised that guidelines for schools be drawn up on the contents of and the terminology to be used in sex education in a circular of april the minister of education adopted the committee s conclusions as from the school year reproduction of man became a compulsory part of biology lessons whereas an official guide issued by the ministry dating from september specified that only those children whose parents had given their express consent should receive sex education proper the danish government anxious to reduce the disconcerting increase in the frequency of unwanted pregnancies instructed a committee in to examine the problem of sex education seksualoplysningsudvalget the setting up of such a committee had been urged among others by the national council of danish women danske kvinders nationalråd under the chairmanship of mrs. else-merete ross a member of parliament and by the board of the mothers aid institutions mødrehjælpsinstitutionernes bestyrelse every year the latter bodies received applications for assistance from about young unmarried mothers of whom half were below twenty years of age and a quarter below seventeen in addition many children often of very young parents were born within the first nine months after marriage legal abortions for their part numbered about every year and according to expert opinions illegal abortions about whereas the annual birth rate was hardly more than in after a thorough examination of the problem the above-mentioned committee which was composed of doctors educationalists lawyers theologians and government experts submitted a report no entitled sex education in state schools seksualundervisning i folkeskolen m.v. betænkning nr modelling itself on the system that had been in force in for some years the committee recommended in its report that sex education be integrated into compulsory subjects on the curriculum of state schools however there should be no obligation for teachers to take part in this teaching the report was based on the idea that it was essential for sexual instruction to be adapted to the children s different degrees of maturity and to be taught in the natural context of other subjects for instance when questions by the children presented the appropriate opportunity this method appeared to the committee particularly suited to prevent the subject from becoming delicate or speculative the report emphasised that instruction in the matter should take the form of discussions and informal talks between teachers and pupils finally it gave an outline of the contents of sex education and recommended the drawing up of a new guide for state schools in march the minister of education tabled a bill before parliament to amend the state schools act the bill provided inter alia that sex education should become obligatory and an integrated part of general teaching in state primary schools in this respect the bill was based on the recommendations of the committee on sex education with one exception following a declaration from the national teachers association it did not grant teachers a general right of exemption from participation in such instruction the bill had received the support not only of this association but also of the national association of school and society representing on the national level education committees school boards and parents associations and of the national association of municipal councils section para of the act which was passed unanimously by parliament and became law on may added library organisation and sex education to the list of subjects to be taught set out in section para of the state schools act accordingly the latter text henceforth read as follows bekendtgørelse no of june in addition to the foregoing the following shall also apply to teaching in primary schools road safety library organisation and sex education shall form an integral part of teaching in the manner specified by the minister of education the act entered into force on august as early as june a circular from the minister of education cirkulære om ændring af folkeskoleloven had advised municipal councils school commissions school boards teachers councils and headmasters of schools outside that further texts accompanied by new teaching instructions on sex education would be issued the circular specified that henceforth parents would still have the possibility of exempting their children from such education and teachers that of not dispensing it after the passing of the act the minister of education requested the curriculum committee to prepare a new guide to sex education in state schools intended to replace the guide paragraph above the new guide vejledning om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen hereinafter referred to as the guide was completed in april it set out the objectives of sex education as well as certain general principles that ought to govern it and suggested detailed curricula for the various classes on the basis of the recommendations in the guide the minister of education laid down in executive order no of june bekendtgørelse om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen the rules of which he had given notice in his circular of june the executive order which applied to primary education and the first level of secondary education in state schools outside was worded as follows section the objective of sex education shall be to impart to the pupils knowledge which could sex education at all levels shall form part of the instruction given in the general school subjects in particular danish knowledge of christianity biology hygiene history civics and domestic relations in addition a general survey of the main topics covered by sex education may be given in the sixth and ninth school years section the organisation and scope of sex education shall be laid down in or in accordance with the curriculum assistance in this respect is to be obtained from the guide issued by the state schools curriculum committee if the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of section para is provided in the sixth and ninth years a small number of lessons shall be set aside each year for this purpose restrictions may not be imposed upon the range of matters dealt with in accordance with sub-section so as to render impossible the fulfilment of the purpose of sex education the restrictions on the carrying out of sex education in schools as indicated in part of the guide shall apply regardless of the provisions of the curriculum section sex education shall be given by the teachers responsible for giving lessons on the subjects with which it is integrated in the relevant class and in accordance with the directives of the principal of the school if it is not clear from the curriculum which subjects are linked to the various topics to be taught the class teachers shall distribute the work as far as need be in accordance with the recommendation of the teachers council this latter opinion must be approved by the school board pursuant to section para of the school administration act a teacher can not be compelled against his will to give the special instruction in the sixth and ninth years referred to in the second sentence of section para section the present order shall come into force on august at the same time the right of parents to have their children exempted from sex education given at school shall cease they may nevertheless on application to the principal of the school have them exempted from the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of section para a ministry of education circular cirkulære om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen also dated june and sent to the same authorities as that of june paragraph above gave the recipients inter alia certain particulars on the preparation of state school curricula in this field it drew in particular their attention to the fact that it was for the school commission after discussion with the joint council of teachers to prepare draft provisions governing sex education to be included in the curricula of the schools of the municipality recalling that these provisions may take the form of a simple reference to the recommendations in the guide the circular pointed out that the guide gave for the fifth to tenth year classes various possibilities as regards the manner and scope of teaching thus if there were a simple reference to the guide it is for the institution teachers council to take a decision in this respect with the agreement of the school board the objectives set out in the executive order of june were identical with those of the guide except that the latter contains an addition to the effect that schools must try to develop in pupils openness with regard to the sexual aspects of human life and to bring about such openness through an attitude that will make them feel secure the principle of integration provided for in paragraph of section of the executive order is explained as follows in the guide the main purpose of integration is to place sex guidance in a context where the sexuality of man does not appear as a special phenomenon sexuality is not a purely physical matter nor is it a purely technical matter .... on the other hand it is not of such emotional impact that it can not be taken up for objective and sober discussion the topic should therefore form an integral part of the overall school education as for the definition of the manner and scope of sex education section para of the executive order the guide indicates the matters that may be included in the state school curricula in the first to fourth years instruction begins with the concept of the family and then moves on to the difference between the sexes conception birth and development of the child family planning relations with adults whom the children do not know and puberty the list of subjects suggested for the fifth to seventh years includes the sexual organs puberty hormones heredity sexual activities masturbation intercourse orgasm fertilisation methods of contraception venereal diseases sexual deviations in particular homosexuality and pornography the teaching given in the eighth to tenth years returns to the matters touched on during the previous years but puts the accent on the ethical social and family aspects of sexual life the guide mentions sexual ethics and sexual morals different views on sexual life before marriage sexual and marital problems in the light of different religious and political viewpoints the role of the sexes love sex and faithfulness in marriage divorce etc the guide advocates an instruction method centred on informal talks between teachers and children on the basis of the latter questions it emphasises that the instruction must be so tactful as not to offend or frighten the child and that it must respect each child s right to adhere to conceptions it has developed itself to the extent that the discussion bears on ethical and moral problems of sexual life the guide recommends teachers to adopt an objective attitude it specifies the teacher should not identify himself with or dissociate himself from the conceptions dealt with however it does not necessarily prevent the teacher from showing his personal view the demand for objectivity is amplified by the fact that the school accepts children from all social classes it must be possible for all parents to reckon safely on their children not being influenced in a unilateral direction which may deviate from the opinion of the home it must be possible for the parents to trust that the ethical basic points of view will be presented objectively and soberly the guide also directs teachers not to use vulgar terminology or erotic photographs not to enter into discussions of sexual matters with a single pupil outside the group and not to impart to pupils information about the technique of sexual intercourse section para of the executive order the applicants claim however that in practice vulgar terminology is used to a very wide extent they refer to a book by bent h. claësson called dreng og pige mand og kvinde boy and girl man and woman of which copies have been sold in according to them it frequently uses vulgar terminology explains the technique of coitus and shows photographs depicting erotic situations on the subject of relations between school and parents the guide points out inter alia in order to achieve an interaction between sex education at the school and at home respectively it will be expedient to keep parents acquainted with the manner and scope of the sex education given at school parent class meetings are a good way of establishing this contact between school and parents discussions there will provide the opportunity for emphasising the objective of sexual instruction at the school and for making it clear to parents that it is not the school s intention to take anything away from them but rather to establish co-operation for the benefit of all parties it can also be pointed out to parents that the integrated education allows the topic to be taken up exactly where it arises naturally in the other fields of instruction and that generally this is only practicable if sex education is compulsory for pupils besides through his contacts with the homes the class teacher will be able to learn enough about the parents attitude towards the school towards their own child and towards its special problems during discussions about the sex education given by the school sceptical parents will often be led to realise the justification for co-operation between school and home in this field as well some children may have special requirements or need special consideration and it will often be the parents of these children who are difficult to contact the teacher should be aware of this fact when gradually the teacher homes and children have come to know each other a relationship of trust may arise which will make it possible to begin sex education in a way that is satisfactory to all parties the executive order no of june which came into force on august repealed the executive order of june the new order reads section the objective of the sex education provided in folkeskolen shall be to impart to the pupils such knowledge of sex life as will enable them to take care of themselves and show consideration for others in that respect schools are therefore required as a minimum to provide instruction on the anatomy of the reproductive organs on conception and contraception and on venereal diseases to such extent that the pupils will not later in life land themselves or others in difficulties solely on account of lack of knowledge additional and more far-reaching goals of instruction may be established within the framework of the objective set out in sub-section above sex education shall start not later than in the third school year it shall form part of the instruction given in the general school subjects in particular danish knowledge of christianity biology hygiene history civics and domestic relations in addition a general survey of the main topics covered by sex education may be given in the sixth or seventh and in the ninth school years section the organisation and scope of sex education shall be laid down in or in accordance with the curriculum if the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of section para is provided a small number of lessons shall be set aside for this purpose in the relevant years section sex education shall be given by the teachers responsible for giving lessons on the subjects with which it is integrated in the relevant class and in accordance with the directives of the principal of the school if it is not clear from the curriculum which subjects are linked to the various topics to be taught the class teachers shall distribute the work as far as need be in accordance with the recommendation of the teachers council this latter opinion must be approved by the school board pursuant to section para of the school administration act a teacher can not be compelled against his will to give the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of section para nor shall it be incumbent upon the teacher to impart to pupils information about coital techniques or to use photographic pictures representing erotic situations section on application to the principal of the school parents may have their children exempted from the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of section para in a circular of june cirkulære om ændring af reglerne om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen sent to the same authorities as that of june paragraph above the minister of education stated that the aim of the new executive order was to enable local school authorities and consequently parents to exert greater influence on the organisation of the teaching in question in addition sex education which remains an integral part of school education which is to say that it should form part of the instruction given in obligatory subjects was to have a more confined objective and place greater emphasis on factual information the circular pointed out that henceforth sex education could be postponed until the third school year it also mentioned that whilst the executive order no longer contained a reference to the guide which was still in force this was to emphasise that the guide was simply an aid to local school authorities in the drawing up of curricula finally the circular gave details on the role of teachers if a teacher thought he would not be able to take care of this instruction in a satisfactory manner he should be afforded the opportunity of attending one of the information courses provided by the teachers in addition the minister expressly recommended that special consideration be given to the personal and professional qualifications of teachers when courses including sex education are distributed amongst them according to the applicants the result of the executive order of june was to free teachers from the duty of giving instruction in sex it was alleged that in fact the minister of education issued it because many teachers vigorously protested against this duty on june the danish parliament passed a new state schools act act no which became fully effective on august however it has not amended any of the provisions relevant to the present case sex education remains an integral and obligatory part of instruction in the elementary school neither has the act changed the former rules on the influence of parents on the management and supervision of state schools while the bill was being examined by parliament the christian people s party tabled an amendment according to which parents would be allowed to ask that their children be exempted from attending sex education this amendment was rejected by votes to although primary education in private schools must in principle cover all the topics obligatory at state schools paragraph above sex education is an exception in this respect private schools are free to decide themselves to what extent they wish to align their teaching in this field with the rules applicable to state schools however they must include in the biology syllabus a course on the reproduction of man similar to that obligatory in state schools since paragraph above the applicants maintain that the introduction of compulsory sex education did not correspond at all with the general wish of the population a headmaster in nyborg allegedly collected protest signatures in a very short space of time similarly an opinion poll carried out by the observa institute and published on january by a daily newspaper the jyllands-posten is said to have shown that of a random sample of persons aged eighteen or more per cent were in favour of an optional system per cent were against any sex education whatsoever in primary schools and only per cent approved the system instituted by the act according to the authors of two articles published in in the medical journal ugeskrift for læger and produced to the court by the commission the introduction of sex education has not moreover brought about the results desired by the legislator on the contrary indeed the number of unwanted pregnancies and of abortions is said to have increased substantially between and the government argue that the statistics from to can not be taken as reflecting the effects of legislation whose application in practice began only in august facts relating to the applicants mr. and mrs. kjeldsen have a daughter called karen she was born in december and attended st. jacobi municipal school in varde all the municipal schools in this town were still using until the school year the curricula adopted in that is before the act entered into force in varde the curriculum changed only with effect from the school year on april the applicants asked the minister of education to exempt their daughter from sex education saying they wished to give her this instruction themselves on may the ministry replied to the effect that a new executive order on sex education in state schools was in the course of preparation the applicants complained to the danish parliament but without any result they then approached the parliamentary ombudsman folketingets ombudsmand who told them on june that he had no competence to deal with the matter the ministry of education in a letter of july advised the applicants that executive order no paragraph above had been issued and added that for practical reasons it was not possible to exempt children from integrated sex instruction on august the applicants wrote again to the ministry of education this time enquiring about sex education in private schools the ministry told them on september that private schools were not obliged to provide instruction beyond that which since they had been obliged to give within the context of the biology syllabus some weeks before that is on august the school commission of varde had refused a request by the applicants that their daughter should be given free private education on october the ministry replied to a further letter dated september in which the applicants had requested new legislation to provide for free education without sex instruction the ministry said that it did not intend to propose such legislation and it also refused to arrange for the applicants daughter to receive separate education referring to the reply given to another person who in the same field had invoked article of protocol no the ministry stated that danish legislation on sex education complied with this provision particularly in view of the existence of private schools on april the applicants asked the ministry of education why the curricula of the varde municipal schools had not yet been adapted to the new legislation on sex education the file in the case does not reveal whether the ministry replied meanwhile the applicants had withdrawn their daughter from the st. jacobi school and during the school year they educated her at home in august they again sent her to the varde municipal school brorsonskolen they maintained before the commission that the nearest private school was nineteen kilometres from their home and that their daughter who had diabetes could not be away from home for a long period of time the government did not contest these claims mr. and mrs. busk madsen have four children the eldest of whom began school in at a state school in åbenrå they attempted unsuccessfully to have their children exempted from sex instruction mr. and mrs. pedersen have five children of whom three were of school age in two of them ester born in and svend born in attended private schools in order to avoid having to follow sex education courses the third hans kristian born in was enrolled at the poul paghs gade municipal school in ålborg the applicants paid kroner a month for ester who left the latter school in summer to attend a private boarding school at korinth fyn and kroner for svend the pedersens had asked the competent authorities likewise unsuccessfully to exempt their children from sex instruction they stated in their application that they were considering sending their third child as well to a private school if the commission could not help them in march the applicants complained about the use of certain books on sex education at the above-mentioned school these books had apparently been approved by the school board in consultation with the teachers at the school the education and culture committee of the northern jutland county council nordjyllands amtsråds undervisnings og kulturudvalg decided however on june to uphold the school board s action and this decision was confirmed by the minister of education on march the present applications were lodged with the commission on april by mr. and mrs. kjeldsen and on october by mr. and mrs. busk madsen and mr. and mrs. pedersen as the busk madsens and the pedersens stated that they regarded their applications as closely linked with that of the kjeldsens the commission decided on july to join the three applications in accordance with the then rule of its rules of procedure all the applicants maintained that integrated and hence compulsory sex education as introduced into state schools by the act was contrary to the beliefs they hold as christian parents and constituted a violation of article of protocol no the commission took its decision on december on the admissibility of the kjeldsens application and on may partial decisions and july final decisions on the admissibility of the busk madsens and the pedersens applications they were accepted insofar as the applicants challenged the act under article of protocol no but rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies article para art insofar as the applicants were complaining about the directives issued and other administrative measures taken by the danish authorities regarding the manner in which sex education should be carried out in their written pleadings on the merits mr. and mrs. kjeldsen also invoked articles and art art art of the convention in its report of march the commission expressed the opinion that there is no violation of article of protocol no in the existence per se of the danish system of sex education seven votes against seven with the president exercising his casting vote in accordance with the then rule para of the commission s rules of procedure that there has been no violation of article art of the convention unanimously or of article art unanimously that no violation of article art of the convention is disclosed by the facts of the case seven votes against four with three abstentions the report contains three separate opinions at the oral hearings on june the commission s delegates invited the court to judge whether the introduction of integrated and consequently compulsory sex education in state primary schools by the danish act of may constitutes in respect of the applicants a violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the european convention on human rights and in particular those set out in articles and art art art of

the case originated in two applications nos and against bosnia and herzegovina lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two citizens of bosnia and herzegovina mr mlađen šekerović and ms anka pašalić the applicants on december and october respectively ms pašalić was represented by mr b. ćupović the government of bosnia and the government were represented by their agent ms m. mijić the applicants alleged that domestic judgments in their favour finding structural discrimination in the pension system and ordering some general measures to be taken had not been enforced the case is similar to karanović v. no november on march the president of the fourth section decided to give notice of the applications to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the applications at the same time article mr šekerović was born in and lives in ms pašalić was born in and lives in mr šekerović was granted an old-age pension in and ms pašalić in in they moved from what is today the federation of bosnia and the federation to what is today the republika srpska each of the federation and the republika srpska being an entity while they were internally displaced they received their pensions from the republika srpska pension fund the rs fund having returned to the federation in and respectively the applicants unsuccessfully sought to have their pension entitlements transferred from the rs fund to the federation pension fund the fbh fund therefore in they lodged applications with the human rights chamber a domestic human-rights body set up by annex to the general framework agreement for peace in on january the human rights chamber delivered a landmark decision concerning three applicants including one of the applicants in the present case ms pašalić and the applicant in karanović cited above who had been granted pensions in what is today the federation before the war who had then moved to what is today the republika srpska during the war and who for that reason only continued to receive rs fund pensions despite their return to the federation after the war pursuant to the pension agreement see paragraph below they were thus treated differently from those who had stayed in what is today the federation during the war the human rights chamber considered that difference in treatment to be discriminatory and an obstacle to the return of displaced persons to their pre-war homes rs fund pensions were normally lower than fbh fund pensions and the cost of living was normally higher in the federation furthermore it held that the situation complained of had racist connotations given the nature of the war the population that had moved from what is today the federation to what is today the republika srpska during the war had primarily been serbs and those who had stayed were mostly bosniacs and croats the human rights chamber ordered the federation a to take all necessary legislative and administrative actions by july to ensure that the applicants were no longer discriminated against particularly in comparison to those pensioners who had remained in what is today the federation during the war and b to compensate the applicants for the difference between their rs fund pensions and the amount they would have received from the fbh fund from the date of their application to the human rights chamber until the date of the federation s compliance with the order under a above having assessed that her pension from the fbh fund would have been lower than the nominal amount of her pension from the rs fund on july the fbh fund informed ms pašalić that she would not be paid any compensation the fbh fund disregarded the fact that at that time pensioners in the republika srpska as opposed to those in the federation did not receive the nominal amount of their pensions but only a fraction thereof owing to fiscal difficulties in that entity mr šekerović s case was still pending when the human rights chamber ceased to exist on december the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina the took over his case and on june delivered a judgment similar to that in ms pašalić s case on december the fbh fund decided to pay mr šekerović convertible marks bam by way of compensation for the difference between the sum which he had received from the rs fund between april and november and the sum which he would have received from the fbh fund in the same period it also decided to continue paying any such difference in the future in march for example the applicant received bam from the rs fund and bam from the fbh fund after the karanović judgment cited above the fbh fund revised its practice and agreed to compensate ms pašalić for the difference between the sum which she had actually received from the rs fund rather than the nominal amount of her rs fund pension see paragraph above and the sum which she would have received from the fbh fund in the period after february in order to determine the amount due on june and july the fbh fund asked the rs fund to indicate the sums actually paid to ms pašalić the rs fund failed to respond on july and august the fbh fund sent letters to ms pašalić one to an address in sarajevo and the other to an address in belgrade but they were returned as undeliverable addressee unknown in june the applicant finally provided the necessary information and in july the fbh fund paid ms pašalić bam that is bam for bam for and bam for since the applicant had apparently been receiving more from the rs fund than she would have received from the fbh fund in april she thus received bam from the rs fund whereas she would have received bam from the fbh fund on october the held that its decision in mr šekerović s case of june had not been enforced because he had not yet been granted an fbh fund pension see paragraph below according to official figures the average pension has always been lower in the republika srpska than in the federation that difference has however decreased while in the average pension was bam in the republika srpska and bam in the federation in the figures were bam in the republika srpska and bam in the federation furthermore pensioners in the republika srpska now receive as do those in the federation the nominal amount of their pensions until recently the former as opposed to the latter were only receiving a fraction of their nominal pensions owing to fiscal difficulties in that entity the pension agreement between the local pension funds entered into force on march pursuant to article of that agreement persons who were receiving pensions from for example the rs fund on march will continue to receive their pensions from that fund even if they subsequently move to the federation all pensioners living in one entity have equal access to health care regardless of whether they receive their pensions from that entity or from the other entity article of the health care agreement pensions are not taxable in either of the entities regardless of whether they are received from the entity concerned from the other entity or from abroad see the income tax act and the income tax act the former human rights chamber and the constitutional court rendered four decisions concerning nineteen pensioners including the present applicants who had been granted pensions in what is today the federation before the war who had then moved to what is today the republika srpska during the war and who for that reason only had continued to receive rs fund pensions despite their return to the federation after the war they held that this amounted to discrimination and ordered that some general measures be taken by the federation see paragraph above the considered that the full enforcement of those decisions required that the applicants be granted fbh fund pensions and that the applicable legislation be amended so as to render all others in that situation eligible to apply for fbh fund pensions see decisions of december and of october in contrast as regards those who had been granted pensions in what is today the federation before the war who had moved to what is today the republika srpska during the war and who had not returned to the federation after the war the same bodies held that the fact that they received rs fund pensions instead of higher fbh fund pensions did not amount to discrimination human rights chamber s decision of november and constitutional court s decision of april,case originated two applications nos bosnia herzegovina lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention two citizens bosnia herzegovina mr mlađen šekerović ms anka pašalić

the case originated in an application no against the republic of latvia lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a permanently resident non-citizen nepilsone of latvia who was previously a national of the former union of soviet socialist republics ussr ms natālija andrejeva the applicant on february the applicant was represented before the court by mr v. buzajevs member of parliament the latvian government the government were represented by their agent ms i. reine the applicant alleged in particular that by refusing to grant her a state pension in respect of her employment in the former soviet union prior to on the ground that she did not have latvian citizenship the national authorities had discriminated against her in the exercise of her pecuniary rights she relied on article of the convention taken in conjunction with article of protocol no the applicant also claimed to be the victim of a violation of article of the convention in that she had not been able to attend the hearing of her appeal on points of law the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court on july it was declared partly admissible by a chamber of that section composed of boštjan m. zupančič corneliu bîrsan vladimiro zagrebelsky alvina gyulumyan egbert myjer david thór björgvinsson and ineta ziemele judges and vincent berger section registrar on december the chamber relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the grand chamber neither of the parties having objected to relinquishment article of the convention and rule the composition of the grand chamber was determined according to the provisions of article and of the convention and rule it was also decided to give notice of the application to the government of ukraine and the government of the russian federation and to invite them to submit their observations article of the convention and rule however neither government wished to exercise that right the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits a hearing took place in public in the human rights building on june rule there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr buzajevs and ms kauliņa on and july respectively the applicant and the government submitted written replies to the additional questions put by the court at the hearing furthermore in a letter of october the applicant informed the court of new developments in the case the applicant was born in kazakhstan and came to latvia in at the age of when it was one of the fifteen soviet socialist republics ssrs of the soviet union she has been permanently resident there ever since in after finishing her studies at riga polytechnic institute she obtained a job at the chemical complex in olaine working in a laboratory at a recycling plant in the applicant was assigned to the regional division of the environmental protection monitoring department which was part of the ussr ministry of chemical industry until she worked for a state enterprise attached to the ministry with its head office in kyiv ukraine she was subsequently placed under the authority of a subdivision of the same enterprise which was based in belorussia present-day belarus and was itself subordinate to a division with its head office in dolgoprudnyy in the moscow region the enterprise in question was an all-union enterprise предприятие всесоюзного значения and was thus governed by federal law and under the authority of the central government the applicant s salary was paid by monthly post-office giro transfer from kyiv and moscow notwithstanding her successive reassignments the applicant continued to work at the recycling plant in olaine furthermore throughout this period she remained affiliated to the same local unit of the centralised soviet trade union for workers in the chemical industry on may the supreme council the legislative assembly at the time adopted the declaration on the restoration of the independence of the on november the environmental protection monitoring department was abolished as the enterprise had become autonomous the applicant came under the direct authority of the plant s management in august latvia s independence was fully restored subsequently in december the soviet union the state of which the applicant had hitherto been a national ceased to exist the applicant therefore became stateless following the enactment on april of the act on the status of former ussr citizens without latvian or other citizenship the applicant was granted the status of permanently resident non-citizen nepilsone in september the applicant was made redundant as a result of staff cutbacks she immediately signed a contract with another employer based in for which she worked until her retirement in in august after reaching the age of the applicant retired and asked the social-insurance board for the kurzeme district of riga rīgas kurzemes rajona sociālās apdrošināšanas pārvalde to calculate the amount of her retirement pension vecuma pensija in a letter of august the board notified her that in accordance with paragraph of the transitional provisions of the state pensions act only periods of work in latvia could be taken into account in calculating the pensions of foreign nationals or stateless persons who had been resident in latvia on january it appeared from the applicant s employment record darba grāmatiņa that from january to november she had been employed by entities based in kyiv and moscow the board therefore calculated the applicant s pension solely in respect of her years of service before and after that period as a result the applicant was awarded a monthly pension of only latvian lati lvl approximately euros eur the applicant lodged an administrative appeal against that decision with the state social-insurance fund valsts sociālās apdrošināšanas fonds which dismissed the appeal in a letter of september the fund noted firstly that there was no evidence in the recycling plant s archives that the applicant had been employed there furthermore according to the fund s administration since you had an employment relationship with an employer based outside latvian territory although you carried out your work in latvian territory this period can not be taken into account in the calculation of your pension as the employer did not pay our republic s taxes. in may the state social-insurance agency valsts sociālās apdrošināšanas aģentūra which had replaced the state social-insurance fund asked the social-insurance department of the ministry of welfare labklājības ministrijas sociālās apdrošināšanas departaments for an explanation as to the application of paragraph of the transitional provisions of the state pensions act in the applicant s case in a letter of june the department explained that since the applicant belonged to the category of persons concerned by the provision only the periods in which she had been employed by entities based in could be taken into account in calculating her pension the department added that the only effective means of resolving the issue would be through agreements between latvia ukraine and on mutual recognition of periods of employment the applicant subsequently brought an action against the social-insurance agency in the riga city latgale district court in a judgment of december the court dismissed her application the applicant appealed to the riga regional court which in a judgment of may likewise found against her it held that since the applicant s salary had been paid to her by an employer based outside her employment within latvian territory was to be treated as an extended business trip and could not give rise to any entitlement to a state pension for the period in question on an application by the applicant s lawyer the public prosecutor attached to the appealed on points of law to the senate of the supreme court in a letter of september the registry of the senate informed the applicant that the case had been included on the agenda of a public hearing on october and told her the precise time at which the examination of the appeal was due to start however as the hearing had opened before the time indicated the senate decided to consider the case before the parties had even arrived after hearing the submissions of the representative of the prosecutor general s office in favour of allowing the appeal and after deliberating the senate sitting as an extended bench of seven judges dismissed the appeal holding as follows on the basis of the documents at its disposal the appellate court observed that from january to november ms natālija andrejeva had been employed by enterprises based outside the appellate court was therefore correct in finding that the period during which ms natālija andrejeva had been employed by enterprises based in ukraine and could not be taken into account in calculating her pension in accordance with paragraph of the transitional provisions of the state pensions act pensions of foreign nationals or stateless persons who were resident in latvia on january are calculated in respect of periods of employment in a period of employment within ukrainian and russian enterprises can not be treated as a period of employment in within the meaning of the above-mentioned act section of the state pensions act defines socially insured persons as persons who have paid or whose employer has paid on their behalf social-insurance contributions towards a state pension in accordance with the state social-insurance act by virtue of the state social-insurance act all employees of entities subject to tax in are covered by the compulsory social-insurance scheme ms natālija andrejeva s employers being based in ukraine and russia did not pay contributions in accordingly there is no reason to conclude that having worked for enterprises situated outside ms natālija andrejeva was covered by the latvian social-insurance scheme the senate considers that the cooperation agreement on social security between the republic of latvia and ukraine which was signed in kyiv on february and came into force on june after the date of the judgment appealed against is not a sufficient basis for a court to find that the public authorities acted unlawfully since she had been unable to take part in the hearing the applicant requested the senate to re-examine the case in a letter of october the president of the senate s department of civil cases informed her that the civil procedure act did not provide for the possibility of reviewing a judgment after its delivery in such circumstances however he apologised to the applicant that the hearing had started early and assured her that all the arguments of the parties had been properly examined in a letter of december the ukrainian embassy in informed the applicant that by virtue of the agreement between the two states which had entered into force on june she was entitled to have her pension recalculated to take account of her work for the ukrainian enterprise the embassy therefore invited the applicant to apply to the relevant social-insurance department to recalculate her pension however the embassy informed her that the pension in respect of the ukrainian period of employment would not be paid until the conclusion of inter-state negotiations on the arrangements for payment of pensions in a letter of february the social-insurance agency informed the applicant that with effect from november on the basis of the above-mentioned agreement her pension had been recalculated ex nunc to take account of her years of service for employers based in as a result the monthly amount of her pension adjusted in accordance with the applicable scales was lvl approximately eur in june the monthly pension received by the applicant amounted to lvl approximately eur consisting of the principal sum approximately eur corresponding to the minimum subsistence level guaranteed by the state and a supplement approximately eur these amounts are index-linked and adjusted every six months to take account of inflation and the increase in the guaranteed minimum wage on and october respectively the latvian parliament and the lower house of the russian parliament approved the cooperation agreement on social security signed on december see paragraphs below according to the calculations supplied by the applicant if the agreement were in force and her years of service in russia were taken into account today her basic pension would be increased by and the supplement by the government stated that the total monthly amount received by the applicant would be lvl approximately eur in that event before persons resident in latvian territory were covered by the same social security scheme as the rest of the population of the in particular the pension system at the time was based not on the contribution principle but on the solidarity principle all pensions were paid from treasury funds a portion of the state s revenue being set aside for pensions more specifically employees themselves were not subject to social tax which was paid by their employers the social-insurance contributions paid by the various employers were transferred via trade unions to the ussr treasury managed by the ussr state bank those funds were then redistributed among the ssrs for very different purposes including the payment of retirement pensions and the amount of a pension did not depend directly on the amount of tax previously paid to the tax authorities there was also a personal income tax part of which was paid to the central tax authorities and the rest to the local tax authorities of the relevant ssr however personal income-tax revenues were practically never used for pension payments the government provided the following description of the soviet social security system taken from an encyclopaedic dictionary published in contributions by enterprises institutions and organisations for the purposes of social insurance are calculated on the basis of a set percentage of the wage fund and distributed among the various trade unions according to the nature and importance of work in the sector concerned these contributions form the social-insurance budget which is part of the budget the state social-insurance budget is approved by the all-union central council of trade unions and is managed by trade unions retirement pensions for pensioners who continue to work are likewise paid from the social-insurance budget those who no longer work receive their pensions from the state social-insurance budget constituted through funds

for certifying calculating and monitoring insurance periods apdrošināšanas periodu pierādīšanas aprēķināšanas un uzskaites kārtība rule of the rules states that any work carried out for entities situated in latvian territory is to be treated as employment in on february twenty members of parliament applied to the constitutional court satversmes tiesa seeking a ruling that paragraph of the transitional provisions of the state pensions act which made a distinction on the ground of nationality was incompatible with articles and of the constitution and article of the convention taken together with article of protocol no in a judgment of june case no the held that there had been no breach of the provisions cited it made the following observations in particular t he applicants authorised representative argues that in view of their legal status non-citizens are not connected to any state other than latvia accordingly they are not able to exercise individually their right to social security the representative further submits that the distinction established in the provision in issue is not based on any economic or social factors that furthermore the distinction is not founded on the legal status of citizens and non-citizens as defined in latvian legislation and that the above argument is corroborated in particular by the fact that once they are granted citizenship by means of naturalisation non-citizens automatically become entitled to social security in respect of their years of employment outside latvia on may the supreme council adopted the declaration on the restoration of the independence of the ‘ the declaration paragraph of the declaration contains an undertaking ‘ to guarantee social economic and cultural rights as well as political freedoms corresponding to the universally recognised provisions of international human rights instruments to citizens of the republic of latvia and citizens of other states permanently residing in latvia this shall fully apply to citizens of the ussr who wish to live in without acquiring latvian nationality on november six months after adopting the declaration the supreme council passed the state pensions act entitlement to a state pension was granted to all persons residing in the republic of latvia whose place of residence at the time of the act s entry into force on january was in the act provided for the right to social cover in old age it referred to two types of state pension employment pensions including retirement pensions and social welfare pensions anyone covered by the social-insurance scheme of the was entitled to an employment pension anyone not entitled to an employment pension was guaranteed the right to a social welfare pension under the act accordingly for the purposes of the act the terms ‘ state pension and ‘ social cover in old age were identical by section of the act stateless persons who had arrived in latvia from another country and had not been employed by enterprises or institutions of the republic of latvia received their pensions in accordance with agreements signed with the state concerned in the absence of such an agreement they were to be granted a social welfare pension thus pensions were calculated according to the same rules for both of the above-mentioned categories the pension system established by the act was based on the principle of redistribution solidarity which did not encourage any interest on the workers part in ensuring their own old-age cover as strengthened its independence as a state it soon became necessary to develop a new pension system complying with the principles of the european union having assessed the country s economic and demographic situation the available resources and other circumstances on november parliament passed a new act with the same title which came into force on january paragraph of the transitional provisions of the act provides that the period to be taken into account in calculating the state pensions of foreign nationals and stateless persons who were resident in latvia on january comprises their aggregate periods of employment in or periods treated as such periods of employment outside before january and periods treated as such are not taken into account in determining the relevant period for pension calculations the pension scheme introduced in has been favourably received at international level there has been a positive assessment of the radical change in relation to the traditional principle of solidarity between generations money earned by the working generation is paid to current pensioners but at the same time the insurance principle is applied whereby people build up their own funds towards their pension international experts acknowledge that it is not possible to resolve all social issues by means of the pension system as any effort to do so will only create problems endangering the system s long-term stability in passing the state pensions act latvia has adopted principles based on insurance premium payments in respect of state pensions including the rule that the amount of the pension depends on the period of employment this consists of periods of employment as defined by the act and periods treated as such irrespective of the person s nationality in its case-law the european court of human rights determines the compatibility of any claim with article of protocol no defining new criteria in each case not all claims automatically come under the concept of a ‘ possession within the meaning of the convention to determine this issue it is necessary to assess the correlation between the entitlement to the pension or benefit in question and the obligation to pay taxes and other contributions the existence of a right or legitimate expectation must be duly demonstrated a person complaining of interference with the exercise of the right of property must show that he or she has such a right in addition the european court of human rights makes a distinction between a system involving individual contributions to a pension fund where the amount to be paid from the fund can also be determined in each particular case and a system in which there is only an indirect link between the contributions paid and the amount received the latter system can not be regarded as sufficiently tangible yet the right of property as such must be tangible to establish whether the legislative provision in issue concerns the right of property the nature of the pension system should be examined the new pension scheme is a system that creates a ‘ possession it is based on the principle that a person belonging to it has paid contributions into specific pension funds and that the contributions form a share of the funds overall capital furthermore the amount of this share of the capital can be determined at any time in such circumstances the person acquires a ‘ possession within the meaning of the convention in the gaygusuz v. austria case cited by the applicants the european court of human rights found a link between the type of benefit in question to which the applicant was not entitled under austrian law and the payment of contributions to the unemployment insurance fund the court therefore found that the claim fell within the scope of article of protocol no however the pension system which existed in until january was based on the solidarity principle entailing the responsibility of the community as a whole and not creating a direct link between contributions and the amount of the pension where the solidarity principle is applied it is impossible to determine what share of the fund belongs to each of the participants accordingly the right of property protected by article of protocol no does not arise in this case this system does not confer on each individual any entitlement to an identifiable share of the fund but rather the expectation of receiving material assistance according to the circumstances prevailing at the time the pension is to be paid pensions under this system are based on the so-called principle of collective security and can not be granted on the basis of each person s individual contribution it is true that an entitlement to the payment of a certain amount of benefit arises where the system remains continuously in force and the individual satisfies the relevant conditions however even in those circumstances there is no entitlement to a specific amount since the amount is subject to fluctuations and to legal regulation accordingly the provision in issue does not concern the right of property and is not at variance with article of protocol no the applicants submission that the provision in issue infringes article of the convention is therefore likewise unfounded welfare legislation to which the impugned provision relates is a specific field of human rights and in constitutional laws of states and international human-rights instruments is regarded as a general obligation of the state the regulatory mechanism is left to the discretion of each state s legislature the exercise of social rights depends on the country s economic situation and the resources available since the entry into force of the pensions act all persons residing in regardless of nationality are entitled to a state pension in respect of social insurance provided that they are socially insured and have paid insurance contributions for the requisite number of years paragraph of the transitional provisions of the pensions act in its current wording was introduced in order to settle the issue of the reckoning of periods of employment prior to january and periods treated as such in the new pension system it should also be borne in mind that the impugned provision concerns only the category of persons who became entitled to a state pension from january with regard to foreign nationals and stateless persons who were resident in latvia on january periods of employment within the territory of latvia prior to that date are taken into account in calculating their pension in the same way as for latvian citizens accordingly the latvian state is responsible for the periods of employment in latvian territory of all permanent residents of regardless of nationality the distinction made by the provision in issue is objectively justified by the nature and principles of the latvian pension system it can not therefore be regarded as constituting discrimination within the meaning of the constitution the constitutional court considers that the question of aggregate periods of employment of foreign nationals and stateless persons outside latvia before january must be resolved by means of international agreements and with due regard to the principles of fairness proportionality reciprocity and other general rules of law the opinion of the representative of parliament that latvia should not assume the obligations of another state as regards the guarantee of a retirement pension for a period of employment in the territory of another state is well-founded in laws of october and june which came into force on january and july respectively parliament amended a considerable number of the provisions of the state pensions act the relevant paragraphs of the transitional provisions now read as follows paragraph in the case of latvian citizens periods of employment and periods treated as such in the territory of latvia and of the former ussr up to december as well as the aggregate period spent outside latvia in the case specified in sub-paragraph of

non-citizens of latvia latvijas nepilsoņi periods of employment and periods treated as such in the territory of latvia periods treated as such in the territory of the former ussr in the cases specified in sub-paragraphs and of this paragraph and the aggregate period spent outside latvia in the case specified in sub-paragraph shall be counted towards the contribution period up to december the following periods treated as equivalent to employment shall be taken into account in calculating the pension periods of study at higher-education institutions and at other training institutions at post-secondary level subject to a limit of five years in the case of qualifications requiring up to five years of study at the relevant time and a limit of six years in the case of qualifications requiring more than five years of study at the relevant time periods of doctoral studies up to a maximum of three years postgraduate education or ongoing vocational training time spent in places of detention by victims of political persecution in exile and time spent escaping from such places those periods to be multiplied by three or by five in the case of time spent in the soviet far north and regions treated as equivalent paragraph the amendments to the introductory part of paragraph of these transitional provisions concerning the reckoning of periods of employment and periods treated as such for the purpose of calculating pensions shall take effect on january paragraphs and of the transitional provisions see paragraph above were not amended at the material time administrative

the case originated in an application no against the federal republic of germany lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a german national mr günter herrmann the applicant on february the german government the government were represented by their agent mrs a. wittling-vogel of the federal ministry of justice the applicant alleged in particular that his automatic adherence to a hunter 's association and his obligation to allow the exercise of hunting rights on his property violated his rights under articles and of the convention and under article of protocol no to the convention on november the president of the fifth section decided to give notice of the application and decided to communicate the complaints to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the parties replied in writing to each other 's observations in addition third-party comments were received from bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der jagdgenossenschaften und eigenjagdbesitzer bagje represented by mr reh legal counsel and deutscher jagdschutz-verband e. v. represented by mr thies legal counsel who had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule the applicant was born in and lives in stutensee under the german federal hunting law bundesjagdgesetz owners of hunting grounds with a surface of less than hectares are de jure members of a hunting association jagdgenossenschaft while owners of bigger plots of land manage their own hunting district the applicant owns two landholdings in rhineland-palatinate which are smaller than hectares in a single block he is thus an automatic member of a hunting association in the instant case of the on february the applicant who is opposed to hunting on ethical grounds filed a request with the hunting authority to terminate his adherence to the hunting association the authority rejected his request on the grounds that his adherence was prescribed by law and that there was no provision on the termination of adherence the applicant brought proceedings before the relying in particular on the court 's judgment in the case of chassagnou and others v. france gc nos and echr he requested the court to establish that he was not a member of the hunting association of the on january the administrative court rejected the applicant 's request it considered that the federal hunting law did not violate the applicant 's rights with regard to the chassagnou-judgment the administrative court considered that the situation in germany differed from the one in it observed in particular that the german owners of hunting grounds by way of their adherence to the hunting association were in a position to influence the decision-making process on how the hunting rights should be exercised furthermore they had a right to receive a share of the profits derived from the exploitation of the hunting rights all owners of plots which were too small to allow a proper management of hunting rights adhered to a hunting association the court also considered that the hunting associations did not only serve the leisure interests of those who exercised the hunting rights but imposed certain specific obligations on them which served the general interest in particular the duty to manage the game stock with the aim of maintaining varied and healthy game populations and to avoid damages caused by wild game they were furthermore obliged to comply with specific quotas set by the administration for the hunting of game these duties applied in the same way to the owners of hunting grounds more the hectares of area notwithstanding the fact that these bigger plots were not regrouped in hunting associations on july and april the rhineland-palatinate administrative court of appeal and the rejected the applicant 's appeals on the same grounds as the administrative court on december the federal constitutional court bvr refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint for adjudication it noted at the outset that the provisions of the federal hunting law did not violate the applicant 's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his property but defined and limited the exercise of this right in a proportionate way the relevant provisions pursued legitimate aims were necessary and did not impose an excessive burden on the landowners when defining the content and the limits of property rights the legislator had to weigh the proprietors legitimate interests against the general interest he had in particular to respect the principles of proportionality and of equal treatment the limitations imposed on the exercise of property rights must not infringe the core area of the protected right the margin of appreciation allocated to the legislator depended on the specific context the stronger the social context the wider the margin of appreciation applying these principles to the instant case the considered that the applicant 's obligatory adherence to a hunting association did not violate his property rights the core-area of that right was not infringed the federal hunting law pursued legitimate aims and limited the property rights in a proportionate way encompassed in the notion of management and protection of the game stock hege it had the aim to preserve the game in a way that was adapted to the rural and cultural conditions and to ensure a healthy and varied wildlife under the federal hunting law game keeping was not only an instrument to prevent damages caused by wild-life but also to avoid any impediment to the agricultural forestry and fishery exploitation of the land these aims served the general interest the obligatory adherence to a hunting association was an appropriate and necessary means to achieve these aims referring to paragraph of the above-cited chassagnou judgment the considered that the court had acknowledged that it was undoubtedly in the general interest to avoid unregulated hunting and encourage the rational management of game stocks the obligatory adherence to a hunting association was also a proportionate means the impact on the property rights was not particularly serious and did not outweigh the general interest in a rational management of game stocks furthermore the federal hunting law endowed every member with the right to participate in the decisionmaking process and to receive a share of the profits derived from the lease of the hunting rights the further considered that there was no violation of the applicant 's freedom of conscience referring to paragraph of the chassagnou judgment it accepted that the applicant 's convictions attained a certain level of cogency cohesion and importance and where therefore worthy of respect in a democratic society accordingly the considered that the applicant 's complaint might fall within the scope of freedom of conscience but that there was in any event no violation of that right the applicant was neither enjoined to exercise the hunt himself nor to participate in it or to support it the fact that he had to tolerate the exercise of the hunt on his premises did not result from his own decision but was the result of the legislator 's legitimate decision the right to freedom of conscience did not encompass the right that the whole legal order was submitted to one 's own ethical standards if the legal order distributed the right to exploit a certain property to several claimholders the owner 's conscience did not necessarily outweigh the other claimholders constitutional rights if the applicant 's landholding and that of other owners who were opposed to hunting were removed from the hunting association because of their convictions the whole system of property ownership and of the management of the game stock would be jeopardised the right to freedom of conscience did not outweigh the general interest in the instant case the further considered that the applicant 's complaint did not come within the scope of the right to freedom of association because the german hunting associations were of a public nature vested with administrative rule-making and disciplinary prerogatives they remained integrated into state structures there was thus no doubt that the association was not simply qualified as public in order to remove it from the scope of article of the convention the further considered that the applicant 's right to equal treatment had not been violated there was an objective reason which justified drawing a distinction between the owners of landholdings less than hectares in area and those more than hectares in area contrary to the situation in france which had been examined by the court in the chassagnou judgment the federal hunting law applied to the whole surface of and was binding on all landowners the owners of land

living with his son and had been avoiding bringing up the child and supporting him financially on october the local administration conducted an inspection of ms t.k. s living conditions in the course of the inspection it was established that d. lived with his grandparents in a fully furnished two-bedroom flat where he had his own bed and plenty of toys and children s games during the inspection ms t.k stated that d. s parents did not play any part in his upbringing according to the results of the inspection ms t.k had created the necessary conditions for d. s upbringing and wellbeing on october

restrict rather than terminate the applicant s parental rights on the same date ms o.r made a written statement to the effect that she agreed to her mother s remaining d. s guardian since ms t.k was taking proper care of him ms o.r further stated that due to her state of health and lack of work and financial means she was not in a position to bring d. up herself she believed that her husband was not in a position to bring d. up either due to his state of health and his way of life as he tended to drink and spend nights away from home a representative of the local custody and guardianship authority certified that the statement had been written in his presence in a letter of june the applicant s psychiatrist replied to a request for information sent by the applicant s lawyer in the context of the aforementioned civil proceedings the letter stated that the applicant was suffering from an organic lesion of the brain which caused a psychiatric disorder he had periodic mood swings but when in remission was well balanced and could work the applicant did not display psychotic symptoms delirium or intellectual or personality changes he had never tended to behave aggressively towards himself or others according to the psychiatrist the applicant s condition neither impaired his ability to take care of his son and bring him up nor posed any danger to the child s life or health on june the applicant further underwent an examination at st psycho-neurological clinic no a report on the results of that examination stated that the applicant did not display any socially dangerous tendencies and that his mental condition did not impair his ability to fulfil his parental duties on august the custody and guardianship authority provided the court with the opinion that it would be in d. s best interest for the parental rights of the applicant and ms o.r to be restricted on august the applicant modified his counterclaim waiving his request to have his son transferred to his care as he had realised that it would be in the child s interests to continue living with his grandparents he also maintained his request to have ms t.k. s guardianship of his son revoked and requested the court to determine his contact rights in respect of his son to the extent and in the manner desired by him in particular the applicant sought the right to visit d. at ms t.k. s home with prior notification to ms t.k and without any restrictions on the number and length of such visits the right to pick d. up from school with a view to their spending time together with prior notification to ms t.k and indication of the amount of time the applicant intended to spend with d. and the time at which he would bring the boy back to ms t.k. s home the right to have the boy overnight at weekends and public holidays not more than twice a month with prior notification to ms t.k and indication of the amount of time the applicant intended to spend with d. and the time at which he would bring the boy back to ms t.k. s home ms t.k also to have the right to visit d. at the applicant s home the right to have the boy during school holidays and take him travelling with prior notification to ms t.k and indication of the amount of time the applicant intended to spend with d. and the time at which he would bring the boy back to ms t.k. s home on august the st petersburg nevskiy district court delivered its judgment the applicant was not present at the hearing but was represented by counsel who objected to the claim and supported the counterclaim the court noted that the applicant had been present at previous hearings and had objected to the claim the court examined the adduced materials which included the results of the inspections of living conditions medical certificates and opinions concerning the applicant s and ms o.r. s health including those cited above in paragraphs and the opinion of the custody and guardianship authority a letter from d. s kindergarten to the effect that he was being brought up by his grandparents and that his parents who had health problems played no part in his upbringing and showed no interest in him a letter from a children s outpatient clinic to the effect that it was d. s grandmother and not his parents who took him to the clinic a letter of reference from the applicant s employer to the effect that he was polite disciplined and cared about his son and statements by ms o.r to the effect that she also had no objection to the restriction of her parental rights or to ms t.k remaining d. s guardian the court also examined a number of witnesses witness k. a relative of ms t.k. submitted that she often visited the latter d. lived with ms t.k and the applicant and ms o.r visited him there ms t.k provided d. with everything required for his well-being but his parents were not involved in his upbringing witness m. who had no family relationship with either party stated that d. lived with ms t.k and that she was not aware of any conflicts between them d. s mother did not live with them and did not play a part in d. s upbringing the latter called his grandparents mother and father witness o.i.r. the applicant s mother submitted that although the defendants were ill the applicant was able to take care of the child she also helped with d. s upbringing and support witness s. who had no family relationship with either party stated that she knew the applicant from the time he had spent in a rehabilitation centre the latter treated his son with respect and wanted to take care of him witness p. an acquaintance of ms t.k. submitted that d. attended kindergarten his mother had visited him there only twice in the course of a year and during one of the visits she had behaved aggressively towards kindergarten staff d. mostly talked about his grandparents he rarely referred to his parents but also never said anything negative about his father the court found that for a prolonged period of time parental duties in respect of d. had been carried out by ms t.k. as the child had been taken by her from the maternity ward after his birth and had lived with her ever since the court further noted that ms o.r had avoided bringing d. up because of her mental health and that the applicant had neglected his parental duties for a prolonged period of time because of his mental impairment and the difficult circumstances of his life on account of ms o.r. s illness the court disregarded her statements to the effect that she accepted the restriction of her parental rights however it allowed the claim lodged against ms o.r on the ground of her health and the fact that she had completely neglected her parental responsibilities the court then observed that the applicant who was suffering from a chronic disorder with periods of both aggravation and remission had not completely avoided bringing up and supporting his child however the court referred to the nature of the applicant s disorder and considered that it could be dangerous for the boy to live with the applicant because of circumstances independent of the applicant his brain disorder the court therefore considered it necessary to restrict the applicant s parental rights with reference to article of the russian family code the court rejected the applicant s lawyer s argument to the effect that it had not been proven that the applicant posed any danger to his son it stated in this respect that ms t.k. s request for the applicant s parental rights to be restricted was based not only on his psychiatric condition but also on his conduct which demonstrated that he had avoided playing a part in the child s upbringing the court further considered that d. should continue to benefit from ms t.k. s guardianship and rejected that part of the applicant s claim on the other hand the court noted with reference to medical evidence that the applicant s mental health did not render contact between him and his son impossible it therefore held taking into account the favourable opinion of the local custody and guardianship authority in this respect that all types of contact between the applicant and d. as requested by the applicant in his counterclaim of august should be allowed the court stipulated however that they may only take place with the consent of guardian ms t.k. lastly the court also added that by virtue of article of the russian family code the applicant would be able to request a court to lift the restriction of his parental rights and return his son to him if the reasons on the basis of which such restrictions had been imposed ceased to exist in his appeal statement against the judgment of august the applicant argued that the decision of the nevskiy district court to restrict his parental rights was erroneous as it had not been shown that he posed any danger to his son the applicant also pointed out that in the part which allowed him to have contact with his son the judgment was illusory because it made those contacts dependent on the consent of d. s guardian ms t.k according to the applicant in a situation where he was in an obvious conflict with ms t.k and where the latter was seeking to have his parental rights restricted it was hardly conceivable that she would favour any contact between him and the child and that therefore he would never be able to exercise these rights he therefore requested the appeal court to remove the words with the consent of guardian ms t.k. from the firstinstance court s judgment and to make his contact with d. dependent on the consent of the custody and guardianship authority rather than on that of ms t.k on october the st petersburg city court upheld the judgment of august on appeal relying in essence on the reasoning of the first-instance court it dismissed the applicant s argument concerning the restriction of his parental rights referring to articles and of the family code the first-instance court findings to the effect that since his birth d. had lived with his grandmother and that his parents were suffering from mental health problems and played no part in his upbringing the opinion of the custody and guardianship authority supporting the restriction of parental rights and the fact that the applicant himself considered that it was in d. s interests to remain in ms t.k. s care the appeal court also dismissed the applicant s argument that it would be impossible for him to have contact with his son if it were made dependent on ms t.k. s consent the court noted in this respect that under article of the russian family code contact between a child and a parent whose parental rights had been restricted was only allowed with the consent of the custody and guardianship authority or the child s guardian the appeal court thus concluded that the nevskiy district court had complied with this provision in its judgment on december the local administration issued a statement to the effect that d. was being provided with all the requisite conditions for his well-being upbringing development and studies he was a successful school student and had received a distinction upon completion of the second grade on december the local administration issued another statement to the effect that since the applicant had been able to have contact with his son as provided by the decision of the nevskiy district court there had been no instances of hindrance of his visiting rights nor had he ever applied for the restriction of his parental rights to be lifted from an interview with d. on december it appeared that he had good relations with his father whom he had last seen two weeks ago the next meeting was scheduled for december on december when d. was in the third grade at school his teacher provided the following information about him d. was a hardworking friendly and cultured boy he received good and excellent grades for all school subjects d. had friends among his schoolmates and did not quarrel with anyone during breaks between classes he was involved in games and communication with his classmates he was also involved in extracurricular activities ms t.k was d. s guardian and at home provided due conditions for his well-being his own room a desk and a bed his grandparents constantly monitored his studies they visited school to enquire about d. s progress ms t.k regularly attended parents meetings at school and took d. to theatres and museums the teacher had never met d. s father as he had never come to the school from ms t.k she knew that d. spent almost every weekend with his father on december a representative of the local custody and guardianship authority interviewed d. the latter stated that he saw his father twice a month they would go together to a museum a theatre an ice-rink or a shop his father also regularly gave him some pocket money and they talked on the telephone approximately once a month in response to the questions d. also stated that his grandparents helped him with his homework and they had taken care of him when he was ill whereas his father had not visited him during his illness on the same date the same representative of the local custody and guardianship authority interviewed ms t.k she stated that the applicant saw d. twice a month and that during d. s illness he had enquired after him on the telephone but had not been to visit him she further submitted that the applicant only helped to bring d. up by paying child support but did not help d. with his studies ms t.k stated that in her view the applicant did not actively show affection towards his son on the basis of the two interviews the representative of the local custody and guardianship authority concluded that the applicant saw his son twice a month and that there had been no hindrance of the visiting rights determined by the decision of the nevskiy district court of august the applicant was passive in his relationship with his son he was not helping him with his studies nor had he visited him when he was ill the applicant had not expressed any wish to take his son to live with him and to bring him up himself the relevant part of the russian family code of provides as follows article restriction of parental rights a court may taking into account the interests of the child decide to remove a child from the parents one of the parents

the case originated in an application no against romania lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a romanian national mr remus florinel cernea the applicant on july the romanian government the government were represented by their agent mrs c. brumar of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicant was given leave by decision of the section president to present his own case to the court rule of the rules of court the applicant alleged in particular a violation of his right to stand without discrimination in the by-elections held on january on april notice of the application was given to the government the applicant was born in and lives in bucharest at the material time the applicant was the executive chair of the partidul verde ecological party a political movement affiliated with the european green party partidul verde had put up candidates for the general elections but failed to win any seats in the applicant was the party s candidate in the presidential elections he won about votes or some of the total validly cast votes the general elections had been governed by law no on elections to the chamber of deputies and the senate amending law no on local authority elections law no on local public authorities and law no on the status of local elected representatives law no see paragraph below in parliament amended law no under law no approving emergency order no law no see paragraph below that amendment made it impossible for parties not represented in parliament as well as independent candidates to put up candidates for or stand in parliamentary by-elections parliamentary by-elections were scheduled for january in order to fill a vacant seat in a bucharest constituency according to information available to the court that seat had fallen vacant in october partidul verde submitted the applicant s candidacy to the electoral board on the party s behalf on december the electoral board rejected the candidacy on the grounds that partidul verde was not represented in parliament partidul verde represented by the applicant challenged that rejection before bucharest county court the county court and requested the acceptance of the applicant s candidacy it entered an objection of unconstitutionality under section of law no see paragraph below it alleged in particular that the ban on candidates from parties not represented in parliament and independent candidates infringed the right to free elections and amounted to unjustified discrimination as compared with parties represented in parliament the party added that contrary to the recommendations of the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission see paragraphs and below law no had been amended less than one year before the by-elections by interlocutory decision of december the county court deferred its ruling so that the constitutional court could consider the objection of unconstitutionality by decision no of january the constitutional court dismissed the objection of unconstitutionality having reiterated that parliament s political structure was defined by general elections the constitutional court rejected partidul verde s arguments as follows the constitutional court observes that the reason for the holding of the parliamentary by-elections was the fact that a parliamentary seat had fallen vacant such by-elections are held in order to assign seats in parliament while simultaneously respecting the structure of parliament as it emerged from the latest general elections in order to respect the sovereignty and the will of the electorate as expressed in the framework of general elections it is necessary that the by-election stage which is subsidiary and complementary to the general elections should observe the electoral threshold criterion which allows political parties to be represented in parliament to allow candidates to stand in by-elections for political parties which are not represented in parliament would alter the latter s political structure which is incompatible with the votes cast by the electorate during the general elections which led to the constitution of the romanian people s supreme representative body with a specific political make-up which can only be modified in the cases and conditions determined by law moreover allowing a person who does not belong to a party represented in parliament to obtain a parliamentary mandate further to by-elections would be tantamount to allowing something which had not been obtained in the framework of general elections to be obtained by the ‘ devious means of a by-election. as regards the plea based on the recommendations of the venice commission the constitutional court assessed it with reservations it noted that the said recommendations advised against amending the electoral law less than one year before any elections but that they also comprised the hypothesis that such amendments should be adopted at the level of the constitution or at a level higher than that of ordinary law see paragraph below in the present case the constitutional court ruled that the recommendation had been complied with because the amendment to law no had been effected under an organic law which met the criterion of a level higher than that of ordinary law see paragraph below by judgment of march the county court dismissed the party s challenge referring to the reasoning of the constitutional court in its aforementioned decision of january to the effect that since partidul verde had failed to pass the electoral threshold in the general elections it could not put up candidates for the by-elections the county court further noted that the elections had already been held and that the challenge had therefore become devoid of purpose fresh parliamentary by-elections were scheduled for april in bucharest to fill another vacant seat the applicant stood as an independent candidate his candidacy was rejected by the electoral board pursuant to section of law no the applicant appealed to the county court against the rejection of his candidacy and lodged a fresh objection of unconstitutionality by decision no of april the constitutional court allowed the objection of unconstitutionality lodged by the applicant and declared the part of the impugned section prohibiting independent candidacies unconstitutional on the grounds that it infringed the right to stand for election the relevant parts of that decision read as follows although as regards political parties which are not represented in parliament the constitutional court s decision no of january set out the reasons justifying in the light of constitutional standards the elimination of such parties from by-elections as regards independent candidates no reason was given for subjecting them to the same legal treatment thus the electoral threshold means that political parties must be representative to some extent of the electorate as required by the sovereignty principle in the case of independent candidates however such a criterion would be absurd they are asked to submit support lists comprising the signatures of a minimum of all the voters registered in the permanent electoral lists of the boards to which they submit their candidacies and the total number should not be lower that electors in the case of the chamber of deputies and electors in the case of the senate consequently for general elections the legislature had laid down this precondition which is necessary in order to stand as an independent candidate and simultaneously in order to exercise the right to be elected nevertheless in relation to by-elections the legislature failed to lay down the requisite conditions for this category of persons standing for election providing that the category of candidates for by-elections comprised only political parties and organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities having passed the legal electoral threshold at the general elections whether individually or in the framework of a political or electoral alliance that being the case it is a case not of setting limits on or circumscribing the manner of exercising the right to be elected but of annulling that right by failing to recognise it by an unlawful absence of regulation in conclusion the electoral law may specify the conditions in which an individual may stand for election as an independent financial deposit a specific number of supporters etc but it can in no way exclude from the electoral process in the case of by-elections the candidacy of a person standing as an independent candidate without thereby infringing the fundamental right enshrined in article of the constitution the right to be elected. the applicant stood in the general elections and obtained a seat in the chamber of deputies for a four-year mandate under article of the romanian constitution parliament enacts constitutional laws organic laws and ordinary laws in particular organic laws are used in very specific fields exhaustively listed in article of the constitution these fields include the electoral system and the organisation and functioning of the permanent electoral authority pursuant to article of the constitution organic laws are enacted on a majority of the members of each chamber of parliament unlike ordinary laws which under article are enacted on a majority of members present law no which was enacted by parliament on march according to the set procedure for organic laws governs parliamentary elections to the chamber of deputies and the senate it provides for forty-three constituencies nationwide each made up of several wards the law defines a single-member ward colegiu uninominal as a unit of an electoral constituency in which one mandate only is assigned section of the law provides that each entity participating in the election a political party a political or electoral alliance or an organisation of citizens belonging to a national minority can put up one candidate only in an electoral ward in particular section of the law lays down that an independent candidate must prove that he or she is supported by at least des electors registered on the electoral rolls in the ward in which he or she is proposing to stand provided that this proportion amounts to at least voters in the case of the chamber of deputies and in the case of the senate the law also provides that by-elections should be held where elections are cancelled in a given constituency or where a deputy s or senator s seat has fallen vacant moreover section of the law concerns the electoral threshold to be attained by candidates for political parties political alliances electoral alliances or organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities the threshold is set as a general rule at of votes validly cast at the national level and there is also a requirement on obtaining at least six single-member wards for the chamber of deputies and three single-member wards for the senate the threshold is slightly higher for political and electoral alliances and a special threshold is set for organisations of citizens belonging to national minorities section of the law provides that votes should be distributed in two stages the first distribution of votes takes place at constituency level according to the individual constituency s electoral quotient section provides that that quotient should be calculated on the basis of the number of votes validly cast for political formations which have passed the electoral threshold and the number of deputies and senators to be elected in the constituency section governs the assignment of seats to independent candidates the latter are assigned a seat if they have obtained a majority of the votes validly cast in the ward in which they were standing under section unused votes and votes falling below the electoral quotient for a given constituency are redistributed at national level during the second stage the government amended law no under an emergency order of august in the framework of its review of that order parliament enacted law no of october law no under the procedure laid down for organic laws pursuant to the latter law a new requirement was introduced into law no concerning by-elections that amendment related to section which now provides by-elections are open only to political parties and organisations of national minorities which passed the threshold for access to parliament at the general elections law no was in force until july when it was replaced by a new electoral law at its session the venice commission adopted a code of good conduct in electoral matters cdlad rev which comprises guidelines and an explanatory report expanding on the principles set out in the latter the relevant provisions of the guidelines read as follows a apart from rules on technical matters and detail which may be included in regulations of the executive rules of electoral law must have at least the rank of a statute the fundamental elements of electoral law in particular the electoral system proper membership of electoral commissions and the drawing of constituency boundaries should not be open to amendment less than one year before an election or should be written in the constitution or at a level higher than ordinary law. the provisions of the explanatory report are described in the case of tănase v. moldova gc no echr in particular the explanatory report recommends

the case originated in an application no against the republic of malta lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two maltese nationals mr albert cassar and ms mariella cassar the applicants on july the applicants were represented by dr i. refalo and dr s. grech lawyers practising in valletta the maltese government the government were represented by their agent dr p. grech attorney general the applicants alleged that they had suffered a violation of article of protocol no as a result of the forced landlord-tenant relationship coupled with the low amount of rent received by them they also alleged a violation of article in conjunction with the above in so far as relevant amendments excluded them from an increase of the rent on june the complaints concerning article of protocol no alone and in conjunction with article were communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applicants were born in and respectively and live in sliema pursuant to the terms of a contract of april a house of fourteen rooms including four double bedrooms in sliema hereinafter the property owned by a third party was rented out under a contract of temporary sub-emphyteusis to j.g for twenty-five years as from june at maltese liras mtl approximately euros eur per year according to the contract the tenant was responsible for all maintenance work both ordinary and extraordinary internally and externally on june by operation of law act xxii of that contract was converted into one of lease and the owner continued to receive rent on january the applicants acquired the property from the above mentioned third party at the price of mtl approximately eur in the full knowledge that the property was occupied under title of lease and that j.g had three children one of whom was unmarried however since all the descendants had settled lives of their own the applicants expected that the property would be returned to them after the tenant s and his wife s death at the time the applicants lived in the united kingdom initially they asked j.g whether he was willing to vacate the property but he did not consent to do so eventually the applicants agreed that j.g and his wife at the time and years old respectively would continue to reside in the property against the rent as adjusted by law they thus recognised them as tenants and regularly received the rent in question eur per year which had been adjusted once and could not be readjusted further since it had reached the maximum amount allowed by law namely double the original rent in the applicants returned to malta in out-of-court discussions they asked j.g and his wife to vacate the premises eventually given their advanced age and respectively and the fact that their children owned properties of their own thus making it unlikely that they would return to live in the premises the applicants decided not to take formal steps to have them evicted however the applicants were unable to find an apartment to rent in malta given that at the time owners were reluctant to lease property to maltese residents because of the rent laws in force in consequence the applicants had to reside in their smaller apartment on the island of gozo and the first applicant was obliged to commute by boat on a daily basis to get to work in the maltese rent laws were amended and a free and open market was re-established for new leases subsequent to the change the applicants found an apartment in malta which they rented at eur annually allegedly the applicants spent eur in maintenance and furnishings in p.g. the daughter of j.g and his wife who had been living in the united kingdom for thirty years in a house she owned returned to live with her parents in the property in malta in and respectively her parents passed away on june the applicants asked p.g to vacate the property she refused and requested that she be recognised as a tenant in accordance with article of chapter of the laws of malta as she had been residing in the property at the date of her father s death the applicants refused to recognise p.g as a tenant and refused to accept rent from her they also insisted she had to undertake repair work in the property pursuant to the original contract p.g. a seventy-year old pensioner had a constant and considerable income a monthly pension of pounds sterling gbp and during her stay in malta she was letting her property in the uk at gbp a month she eventually sold her property in the uk for gbp she went on to inherit various assets and sold them for a considerable sum in the constitutional redress proceedings mentioned below she declared that she needed the property which was spacious in order to store her parent s furniture in the enactment of act x of was meant to ameliorate the position of land owners whose properties were subject to controlled rents the amendments operated to bring rates of rent up to eur per year where these were below that figure however this increase did not apply to the applicants property the rent of which was already more than eur pursuant to the current law the rent applicable in the applicants case is increased every three years in accordance with the increase in the inflation index capped at a on february the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings they claimed that they were suffering a violation of article of protocol no to the convention as a result of the laws in force which allowed the tenant to enjoy a title of lease over their property and made it impossible for them to regain possession of it despite their own need for housing they noted that they were renting a property at eur per year while they were only earning around eur per month eur per year from their own house which had a lease market value of eur per month the applicants further relied on article of the convention the applicants asked the court to order the eviction of the tenant and the latter to pay for ordinary and extraordinary repairs and to award damages for the loss sustained as a result of the low amount of rent received and in connection with the disbursements they had to make for their own housing by a judgment of october the civil court first hall in its constitutional jurisdiction found a violation of article of protocol no to the convention as a result of the application of articles and of chapter of the laws of malta and ordered that the tenant be evicted within four months of the date of judgment it considered that the rent payable namely eur per year in accordance with the law was derisory bearing in mind that such property had a rental market value of eur per month the court noted that while an architect s valuation would have been preferable the latter sum appeared to be an appropriate rent furthermore the burden on the applicants was greater as this arrangement had gone on beyond the death of the original lessor and was now benefitting his daughter the court rejected the remainder of the claims the government and the tenant appealed and the applicants crossappealed by a judgment of february the constitutional court reversed the first-instance judgment and found no violation of the said provision and rejected the remainder of the applicants appeal it considered that act xxii of which provided for the conversion of a temporary emphyteusis into a lease had constituted interference with the applicants right of property as it had created a forced landlord-tenant relationship for an indeterminate time during which they had not been able to use their own property and during which they had suffered financial losses as a result of the low amount of rent received which had been established by law the interference pursued a legitimate socialpolicy aim specifically the social protection of tenants however the applicants fully aware of the factual and legal situation opted of their own free will to purchase the property and to enter into the existing agreement with j.g. whose emphyteusis had just been converted into a lease on june and from whom they continued to receive rent the court concluded that the applicants had not suffered any imposition in so far as they had willingly entered into that contract at a point where the law had been crystal clear as to the consequences which would ensue the applicants are now of pensionable age in or around the applicants were given notice to vacate the property which they had been leasing as their ordinary residence since see paragraph above as there were plans to demolish the property in at the time when they were renting this property the second applicant s mother had been one of five co-owners of the dwelling and it appears that the second applicant has since become a co-owner the government submitted that the applicants had failed to prove that they had been paying rent and if so what rent they had been paying for these premises according to the applicants they have since moved to a different property article of the civil code chapter of the laws of malta defines emphyteusis as a contract whereby one of the contracting parties grants to the other in perpetuity or for a time a tenement for a stated yearly rent or ground-rent which the latter binds himself to pay to the former either in money or in kind as an acknowledgement of the tenure. other articles of the civil code related to this form of contract in so far as relevant read as follows a temporary emphyteusis ceases on the expiration of the time expressly agreed upon and the reversion in favour of the dominus of the tenement together with the improvements takes place ipso jure. the emphyteuta shall keep and in due time restore the tenement in a good state the emphyteuta is bound to carry out any obligation imposed by law on the owners of buildings or lands provided that if for the carrying out of any such obligation a considerable expense is required and the emphyteusis is for a time the court may upon the demand of the emphyteuta compel the dominus to contribute a portion of such expense regard being had to the covenants of the emphyteusis to the remaining period of the grant to the sum of the ground-rent and to other circumstances of the case. section of act xxiii of amending chapter of the laws of malta the housing decontrol ordinance hereinafter the act in so far as relevant reads as follows notwithstanding anything contained in the civil code or in any other enactment the following provisions of this section and of section shall have effect with respect to all contracts of temporary emphyteusis made at any time where a dwelling-house

of this article and after the lapse of every fifteenth year thereafter during the continuance of the lease in favour of the same tenant by so much of the groundrent payable immediately before such commencement or the commencement of each subsequent fifteen year period being an amount not exceeding such ground-rent as represents in proportion to such ground-rent the increase in inflation since the time the groundrent to be increased was last established and ii under such other conditions as may be agreed between them or failing agreement as the board may deem appropriate where on the expiration of an emphyteusis as is mentioned in sub-article a or b the dwelling-house is subject to a lease the provisions of the reletting of urban property regulation ordinance shall not apply in respect of such lease provided that where the tenant under the said lease is a citizen of malta and occupies the house as his ordinary residence he shall on the termination of the lease be entitled to

the ground-rent the ground-rent payable with effect from the conversion of the emphyteusis into a perpetual one and until fifteen years from that date shall be equal to six times the ground-rent payable immediately before such conversion and shall thereafter be increased every fifteen years by so much of the then current groundrent being an amount not exceeding such rent as represents in proportion thereto the increase in inflation since the time the said ground-rent was last established if the emphyteuta does not exercise the right granted to him by sub-article within six months from the date such right is exercisable such right shall with the necessary modifications pass to the occupier of the house who shall be entitled to demand to the exclusion of the emphyteuta that the dwelling-house be granted to him by the owner in perpetual emphyteusis under the same conditions as could have applied if the emphyteuta had converted the emphyteusis into a perpetual one. section of

the case was referred to the court in accordance with the provisions applicable prior to the entry into force of protocol no to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the european commission of human rights the commission on october and by the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the government on december article of protocol no and former articles and of the convention the case originated in an application no against the united kingdom lodged with the commission under former article of the convention by two british nationals mr thomas coster and mrs jessica coster the first applicant and the second applicant respectively on may the applicants alleged that planning and enforcement measures taken against them in respect of their occupation of their land in their caravans violated their right to respect for home family life and private life contrary to article of the convention they complained that these measures also disclosed an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions contrary to article of protocol no to the convention and deprived their children of education contrary to article of protocol no they further complained that they were subject to discrimination as gypsies contrary to article of the convention the commission declared the application admissible on march in its report of october former article of the convention it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of article of the convention votes to that there had been no violation of article of protocol no votes to that there had been no violation of article of protocol no votes to and that there had been no violation of article of the convention votes to before the court the applicants who had been granted legal aid were represented by peter kingshill co. solicitors practising in london the united kingdom government were represented by their agent mr llewellyn of the foreign and commonwealth office on february the panel of the grand chamber determined that the case should be decided by the grand chamber rule of the rules of court the composition of the grand chamber was determined according to the provisions of article and of the convention and rule of the rules of court sir nicolas bratza the judge elected in respect of the united kingdom who had taken part in the commission s examination of the case withdrew from sitting in the grand chamber rule the government accordingly appointed lord justice schiemann to sit as an ad hoc judge in his place article of the convention and rule the applicants and the government each filed a memorial third-party comments were also received from european roma rights centre which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule a hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on may rule there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr drabble and mr pannick on november mr makarczyk who was unable to take part in further consideration of the case was replaced by mr bonello rules b and the applicants are gypsies by birth as children the applicants lived and travelled with their respective families in and around the area known as the borough of maidstone in kent from the borough was a designated area pursuant to section of the caravan sites act see paragraphs below in the applicants married when the second applicant became pregnant the applicants decided to search for a permanent site on which to site their caravan there remained few stopping places upon which they could lawfully park their caravan whilst travelling in the area and they faced the threat of continual eviction the applicants wished for their children to be brought up in a stable environment which would facilitate the continuity of their education the applicants now have four children jody born in tommy in jessica in and joshua in the applicants stated that they were refused a place on any local authorised site they camped outside one official site for weeks hoping to be offered a plot no place was offered and court proceedings were brought against them by the borough to secure their eviction from the land the government stated that the borough has no knowledge or record of any request by the applicants for a pitch in with the imminent birth of their first child the applicants moved into the caravan occupied by the first applicant s mother on a permitted gypsy site and sold their own caravan the caravan was however small and conditions became intolerable having nowhere else to go the applicants in or about reluctantly applied for permanent accommodation and accepted the offer of a council flat they commenced a tenancy in a fourth floor flat on january though they were moved to a first floor flat after months they found the flats totally unsuitable and alien to their traditional gypsy lifestyle on april they requested a transfer to a house on the grounds of the second applicant s health but were informed that there was a waiting list and that a move would be conditional on payment of outstanding rent the applicants disputed that they owed any rent and suggested that the borough has mistaken them for the tenants of a different flat there being some confusion as to the addresses involved in late the applicants requested a site on an official caravan site or more suitable accommodation but were told this was not possible the government stated that they did not wish to be placed on the waiting list in the applicants purchased land known as summerfields in headcorn kent and moved onto it living in a caravan on july the second applicant made a retrospective planning application for permission to station a caravan on their site permission was refused by the borough on october on september an enforcement notice was issued requiring discontinuance of the unauthorised use in july the applicants were convicted for failure to comply with the enforcement notice on september a public enquiry was held by way of appeal against the refusal of planning permission the appeal was dismissed the inspector accepted that the applicants were gypsies for whom conventional residence in permanent accommodation would lead to illness and problems of adjustment they had therefore not lost their status as gypsies as a result of their residence in a flat he found however that the development on a site well outside built-up areas was clearly visible and would constitute a significant intrusion into the attractive rural surroundings and seriously harm the character and appearance of the countryside contrary to the aims of the local development plans the proximity of another established gypsy it is all a matter of weighing opposing considerations and although both national and local policies envisage circumstances where the special needs of gypsies can outweigh the general objective of protecting the countryside my view is that because of such factors as the quality of this countryside they do not prevail here. the applicants made a further application for planning permission which was refused on december seeking inter alia to argue that they had resited the caravan and provided more screening to minimise any visual impact on the landscape and that their site was less harmful than the two poorly screened sites nearby which were authorised by the borough a public enquiry was held before a planning inspector on march the inspector refused their appeal on april and the applicants were penalised in costs on the basis that it was identical to the previous application the inspector did not find the granting of permission for caravans for two gypsy families some metres away along the same road could be regarded as a material difference on the contrary in my opinion three gypsy caravan sites within some m of the length of lenham road would amount to an overconcentration of caravan sites in these rural surroundings. the inspector went on as to … alleged intentional homelessness counsel for the borough on instructions assured the inquiry that the applicants family would be offered short-term housing this is the position the family have faced for a long time the applicants conceded that the only action taken since the decision by or on behalf of the family to find another site or accommodation was a telephone call … to the borough in mid-december … i have given sympathetic consideration to all of the applicants case i accept that the family have a pressing local need for a caravan site the provision of private sites should be encouraged kent county council support the provision of private sites so does government policy there should be a flexible attitude to such planning applications as was said in a parliamentary answer in well-run gypsy sites once established seldom give cause for serious complaints ‘ designated authorities like maidstone may still need to make extra provision in their area if the demand for gypsy accommodation increases there are still gypsy families parked on unauthorised sites in the maidstone area including the applicants … no new gypsy sites have been opened in maidstone since in spite of the applicants planting and intended further planting however i find as a fact that the mobile home would remain intrusively visible from lenham road and baker lane the only way in which it could be made virtually invisible … would be to provide physical screening which would in itself be an intrusive feature in the countryside from the point of view of passers-by the visual impact of the mobile home is made especially serious because of this being a corner site with two long road frontages through which the site can be seen by the public having regard to the quality of the rural landscape i consider that this development seriously damages the appearance and character of the surroundings as this land is between the two authorised sites this development results in an incipient loose ribbon of suburban-type development strung out along lenham road this conflicts with generally well-respected policies aimed at protecting the landscape and at limiting residential development mainly to towns and villages whilst the position towards the eastern corner is an improvement on the previous siting in the northern corner the mobile home still causes demonstrable harm to countryside interests of acknowledged importance there is nowhere within the site at which a mobile home or caravan could be positioned without causing equally serious harm i have taken into account the extent to which this site could satisfy the site-selection criteria… rather than introducing minimum conflict with planning policies this development is in serious conflict with the structure plan policies … aimed as protecting the character of the open countryside from development not demonstrated to be necessary for agriculture etc there is also serious conflict with policy of the draft local plan aimed at ensuring that permitted gypsy sites should not be intrusive features in the countryside. on september the applicants were convicted for breach of enforcement notices and ordered to pay gbp each as a fine and contribute gbp to the borough s costs in february the government stated that the applicants made enquiries from the borough about rehousing but no formal application was made until may on july the applicants were formally informed by the borough that they were considered as intentionally homeless since they had terminated their council tenancy to move onto land not permitted for residential use contrary to the advice of the housing and planning departments in the applicants enquired about alternative accommodation on a private site but were informed that they were excluded due to the size of their family on march the applicants stated that they were told that there was a waiting list for places on official sites but that since they were intentionally homeless they could not put their names on it for years according to the government in march the applicants applied to the the records of the borough noted that at a meeting on june its officials repeated offers of temporary accommodation to give the applicants time to find permanent accommodation the applicants were recorded as stating that they would not accept a place on an official site and that they would only accept temporary accommodation in their own caravan which the borough could not provide the applicants state that they have no recollection of making the former statement a third prosecution resulted in conviction and sentence was deferred to enable the applicants to move on july a fine of gbp was imposed on each applicant the borough took the decision to seek an injunction in the high court restraining the applicants from stationing their caravan on their land and gave notice to the applicants on october the applicants left their land and travelled to whitstable kent close to where some of the second applicant s family had stationed their caravans on the site there was no sanitation or electricity and there was an infestation of rats the applicants contacted the borough s housing officer in the hope that he could offer more suitable alternative accommodation but he could not he suggested that they apply for housing association accommodation which they did but were told that nothing would be available for six months the applicants heard nothing after that the government stated that the applicants names were placed on the waiting list at the end of but they removed their names from that list in january the applicants disputed that they removed their names on december the applicants returned to their land where the children could resume their education at their previous school the borough commenced its proceedings for an injunction by summons dated december on february the second applicant was convicted and fined for a continued breach of the enforcement notices the applicants applied for judicial review to quash the injunction proceedings on the basis that the decision to pursue the injunction against them was unreasonable leave was refused by the high court on may the court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal in may the applicants applied to the borough for accommodation and were again offered temporary accommodation the applicants stated that this was unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation which would have entailed separating the first applicant from the rest of the family the applicants were informed the government stated of vacant plots on council and private gypsy sites in the county the applicants recalled that these vacancies related to areas outside the borough one site which they visited at aylesford was infested with rats and a dangerous place for children on february the applicants received notice that the borough had decided to withdraw the injunction proceedings commenced in and to enter their land and enforce the enforcement notice using its powers under section of the town and country planning act the applicants lodged an application for judicial review of that decision on or about october the applicants withdrew their application on the basis that they would be given weeks to vacate their land the applicants stated that they looked for an alternative private or official site on which to station their caravan but no such site could be found in february the applicants sold their land they also sold their caravan at a substantial undervalue they went to live temporarily in the caravan occupied by the second applicant s brother which involved a family of six sharing with a family of five this became intolerable the applicants stated that they were faced with the choice of returning to the road with the risk of further criminal sanctions or abandoning their traditional way of life by accepting the provision of conventional council accommodation on may the applicants reluctantly decided to take the latter course moving into conventional housing in the form of rented accommodation supplied by the council at no chancery road marden kent as a result their two younger children had to change schools the two older children gave up school and began working while the move disrupted the children s education it did not appear to have affected their health the applicants suffered headaches anxiety claustrophobia and depression requiring them to seek medical treatment they were both prescribed medication which did not however resolve their physical sense of confinement the applicants bought a touring caravan which they stationed on the land of the second applicant s brother they took every opportunity they could to travel in the traditional style during school holidays attending traditional gypsy fairs to continue horse trading activities and for the first applicant to find work landscaping and tree-felling they have bought another plot of land in yalding kent with the intention of resuming their traditional life and intend to apply for planning permission the department of the environment statistics for gypsy caravan sites for january indicated that in the maidstone area there were two local authority sites comprising pitches in addition there were caravans on authorised private sites and eight caravans on unauthorised sites two of which were tolerated by the local authority the july gypsy count showed that the number of unauthorised encampments had remained at eight while the number of public authorised sites had decreased from to and the number of authorised private sites had decreased from to the january figures showed that there were six unauthorised sites authorised public sites and authorised private sites the town and country planning act as amended by the planning and compensation act the act consolidated pre-existing planning law it provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land section of the act a change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development restormel borough council v. secretary of state for the environment and rabey journal of planning law john davies v. secretary of state for the environment and south hertfordshire district council journal of planning law an application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise section of the act the act provides for an appeal to the secretary of state in the event of a refusal of permission section with immaterial exceptions the secretary of state must if either the appellant or the authority so desire give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the secretary of state it is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence see the bryan v. the united kingdom judgment of november series a no p. there is a further appeal to the high court on the ground that the secretary of state s decision was not within the powers conferred by the act or that the relevant requirements of the act were not complied with section if a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission the local authority may issue an enforcement notice if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations section of the act there is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the secretary of state on the grounds inter alia that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question section as with the appeal against refusal of permission the secretary of state must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector again there is a further right of appeal on a point of law to the high court against a decision of the secretary of state under section section such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review it therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational r. v. secretary of state for the home department ex parte brind appeal cases d the high court will also grant a remedy if the inspector s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors or made for an improper purpose in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument however the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so section of the act part ii of the caravan sites act the act was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section of the caravan sites and control of development act section of the act defined gypsies as persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen or of persons engaged in travelling circuses travelling together as such section of the act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities to exercise their powers so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or resorting to their area the secretary of state could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary section where the secretary of state was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of gypsies or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision he could designate that district or county section of the act the effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier section in addition section of the act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section by the it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section of the act was inadequate and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems in february therefore the government asked sir john cripps to carry out a study into the operation of the act he reported in july accommodation for gypsies a report on the working of the caravan sites act the cripps report sir john estimated that there were approximately gypsies living in england and wales he found that six-and-a-half years after the coming into operation of part ii of the act provision exists for only one-quarter of the estimated total number of gypsy families with no sites of their own three-quarters of them are still without the possibility of finding a legal abode only when they are travelling on the road can they remain within the law when they stop for the night they have no alternative but to break the law. the report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation circular was issued by the department of the environment on march its stated purpose was to provide local authorities with guidance on statutory procedures alternative forms of gypsy accommodation and practical points about site provision and management it was intended to apply until such time as more final action could be taken on the recommendations of the cripps report among other advice it encouraged local authorities to enable self-help by gypsies through the adoption of a sympathetic and flexible approach to gypsies applications for planning permission and site licences making express reference to cases where gypsies had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area circular which was issued on august stated inter alia that it would be to everyone s advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation and thus advised local authorities that the special need to accommodate gypsies should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions in addition approximately gbp million was spent under a scheme by which one hundred per cent grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites section of the criminal justice and public order act the act which came into force on november repealed sections of the act and the grant scheme referred to above section of the act gives to a local authority power to direct an unauthorised camper to move an unauthorised camper is defined as a person for the time being residing in a vehicle on any land forming part of the highway any other unoccupied land or any occupied land without the owner s consent failure to comply with such a direction as soon as practicable or re-entry upon the land within three months is a criminal offence local authorities are able to apply to a magistrates court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of such a direction section of the act in the case of r. v. lincolnshire county council ex parte atkinson september sedley j. referred to the act as draconic legislation he commented that for centuries the commons of england provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic enough common land had survived the centuries of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable but by of the caravan sites and control of development act local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers this they proceeded to do with great energy but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by of the same act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons by the caravans act therefore parliament legislated to make the power a duty resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils… for the next quarter of a century there followed a history of non-compliance with the duties imposed by the act of marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty to apparently little practical effect the default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer were rarely if ever used the culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non-compliance was the enactment of … the act of … new guidance on gypsy sites and planning in the light of the act was issued to local authorities by the government in circular january which cancelled circular see above councils were told that in order to encourage private site provision local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development the aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control. para however as with other planning applications proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural archaeological countryside environmental and green belt policies para it was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted for example areas of outstanding natural beauty sites of special scientific interest nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a green belt paragraph further guidance issued by the secretary of state dated november concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land cjpoa above paragraphs required local authorities to adopt a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance accordingly authorities should consider tolerating gypsies presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g toilets a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water where gypsies are unlawfully camped on government-owned land it is for the local authority with the agreement of the land-owning department to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health it will continue to be the policy of the secretaries of state that government departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance the secretaries of state continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly they should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land. paragraphs further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under the act these obligations include their duties concerning pregnant in a letter dated may the department of the environment drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in england that circular required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications the government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up acert research see below had showed that of local authorities had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision it was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and the detailed policies should be provided compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the government s objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation applying for planning permission like everyone else it was necessary therefore that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process the advisory council for the education of romany and other travellers acert which carried out research sponsored by the department of the environment transport and regions noted in this report that since private site provision had increased by caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by caravans disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision noting the the research looked inter alia at refused private site applications which showed that related to land within the countryside and that were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value e.g green belt conservation area locations of the gypsy site applicants interviewed for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life gaining independence and providing security for many the education of their children was another important reason for private site application all save one had applied for permission retrospectively the report stated that the figures for success rates in planning appeals showed that before the success rate had averaged but had decreased since having regard however to the way in which data was recorded the actual success rate was probably between and as given as the figures in and by the gypsy groups and department of the environment respectively notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land-use criteria in the particular case it was therefore not surprising that most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable in january the department of the environment regions and transport figures on gypsy caravans disclosed that of caravans counted were accommodated on local authority pitches on privately owned sites and on unauthorised sites of the latter gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non-gypsies mainly local authority land and gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves on these figures about caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over of caravans were stationed on authorised sites local authority duties to the homeless were contained in part vii of the housing act which came fully into force on january where the local housing authority was satisfied that an applicant was homeless eligible for assistance had a priority need e.g the applicant was a person with whom dependant children resided or was vulnerable due to old age physical disability etc and did not become homeless intentionally the authority was required if it did not refer the application to another housing authority to secure that accommodation was available for occupation by the applicant for a minimum period of two years where an applicant was homeless eligible for assistance and not homeless intentionally but was not a priority case the local housing authority was required to provide the applicant with advice and such assistance as it considered appropriate in the circumstances in any attempt he might make to secure that accommodation became available for his occupation this convention opened for signature on february provides inter alia article the protection of national minorities and of the rights and freedoms of persons belonging to those minorities forms an integral part of the international protection of human rights and as such falls within the scope of international co-operation article the parties undertake to guarantee to persons belonging to national minorities the right of equality before the law and of equal protection of the law in this respect any discrimination based on belonging to a national minority shall be prohibited the parties undertake to adopt where necessary adequate measures in order to promote in all areas of economic social political and cultural life full and effective equality between persons belonging to a national minority and those belonging to the majority in this respect they shall take due account of the specific conditions of the persons belonging to national minorities the measures adopted in accordance with paragraph shall not be considered to be an act of discrimination article the parties undertake to promote the conditions necessary for persons belonging to national minorities to maintain and develop their culture and to preserve the essential elements of their identity namely their religion language traditions and cultural heritage without prejudice to measures taken in pursuance of their general integration policy the parties shall refrain from policies or practices aimed at assimilation of persons belonging to national minorities against their will and shall protect these persons from any action aimed at such assimilation. the convention entered into force on february the united kingdom signed the convention on the date it opened for signature and ratified it on january it entered into force for the united kingdom on may by february it had been signed by of the council of europe s member states and ratified by the convention did not contain any definition of national minority however the united kingdom in its report of july to the advisory committee concerned with the convention accepted that gypsies are within the definition recommendation of the parliamentary assembly on gypsies in europe included the recognition that gypsies as one of the very few non-territorial minorities in europe need special protection in its general observations the assembly stated inter alia respect for the rights of gypsies individual fundamental and human rights and their rights as a minority is essential to improve their situation guarantees for equal rights equal chances equal treatment and measures to improve their situation will make a revival of gypsy language and culture possible thus enriching the european cultural diversity. its recommendations included xiv member states should alter national legislation and regulations which discriminate directly or indirectly against gypsies … further programmes should be set up in the member states to improve the housing situation education … of those gypsies who are living in less favourable circumstances … in the european commission against racism and intolerance issued general policy recommendation no combating racism and intolerance against roma/gypsies its recommendations included … to ensure that discrimination as such as well as discriminatory practices are combated through adequate legislation and to introduce into civil law specific provisions to this end particularly in the fields of … housing and education … … to ensure that the questions relating to ‘ travelling within a country in particular regulations concerning residence and town planning are solved in a way which does not hinder the life of the persons concerned … on april the european parliament passed a resolution on the situation of gypsies in the community calling on the governments of member states to introduce legal administrative and social measures to improve the social situation of gypsies and travelling people in europe and recommending that the commission the council and the governments of member states should do everything in their power to assist in the economic social and political integration of gypsies with the objective of eliminating the deprivation and poverty in which the great majority of europe s gypsy population still lives at the present time. protection of minorities has become one of the preconditions for accession to the european union in november the european union adopted guiding principles for improving the situation of roma in candidate countries based expressly on the recommendations of the council of europe s specialist group of roma/gypsies and the osce high commissioner on national minorities recommendations the situation of roma and sinti has become a standard item on the human dimension section of the agenda of osce review conferences two structural developments the office of democratic institutions and human rights odihr and the appointment of a high commissioner for national minorities also concern protection of roma and sinti as minorities on april the high commissioner s report on the situation of roma and sinti in the osce area was published part iv of the report deals with the living conditions of roma noting that while nomadism had been central to romani history and culture a majority of roma were now it must be emphasised that whether an individual is nomadic semi-nomadic or sedentary should like other aspects of his or her ethnic identity be solely a matter of personal choice the policies of some osc participating states have at times breached this principle either by making a determination of a group s fundamental lifestyle that is inconsistent with its members choices or by making it virtually impossible for individuals to pursue the lifestyle that expresses their group identity. pp the report stated that for those roma who maintained a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle the availability of legal and suitable parking was a paramount need and precondition to the maintenance of their group identity it observed however that even in those countries that encouraged or advised local authorities to maintain parking sites the number and size of available sites was insufficient in light of the need … the effect is to place nomadic roma in the position of breaking the law in some countries committing a crime if they park in an unauthorized location even though authorized sites may not be available. pp the report dealt specifically with the situation of gypsies in the united kingdom pp it found under current law gypsies have three options for lawful camping parking on public caravan sites which the government acknowledges to be insufficient parking on occupied land with the consent of the occupier and parking on property owned by the campers themselves the british government has issued guidance to local authorities aimed at encouraging the last approach in practice however and notwithstanding official recognition of their special situation and needs many gypsies have encountered formidable obstacles to obtaining the requisite permission to park their caravans on their own property… pp concerning the planning regime which requires planning permission for the development of land disclosed by the stationing caravans it stated … this scheme allows wide ply for the exercise of discretion and that discretion has repeatedly been exercised to the detriment of gypsies a report by the department of the environment described the prospects of applying for planning permission for a gypsy site as ‘ a daunting one laced with many opportunities for failure in the last years in which the success of application rates was evaluated it was ascertained that per cent of applications for planning permission by gypsies were denied in contrast per cent of all planning applications were granted during the same period it is to be noted that as a category gypsy planning applications are relatively unique insofar as they typically request permission to park caravans in areas or sites which are subject to restriction by local planning authorities as such virtually all gypsy planning applications are highly contentious nonetheless the fact remains that there is inadequate provision or availability of authorized halting sites private or public which the high rate of denial of planning permission only exacerbates moreover there are indications that the situation has deteriorated since … in face of these difficulties the itinerant lifestyle which has typified the gypsies is under threat. pp the report s recommendations included the following …in view of the extreme insecurity many roma now experience in respect of housing governments should endeavour to regularize the legal status of roma who now live in circumstances of unsettled legality. pp and,case referred court accordance provisions

to their father had been in breach of articles and of the convention by a decision of august the court declared the application partly admissible the applicant and the government each filed further written observations rule the court having decided after consulting the parties that no hearing on the merits was required rule in fine the parties replied in writing to each other 's observations the applicant was born in and lives in the town of the applicant married in the applicant and her husband were nominal but non-practising muslims at that time two children a boy and a girl were born to the couple in and respectively it appears that the family lived at a house of the paternal grandparents in the village of novomugri sergokalinskiy district of the being upset with various difficulties in the relations with her husband who was a seaman and frequently away at sea in june the applicant started associating with the jehovah 's witnesses in june the mounting tensions between the spouses over the applicant 's religious interests resulted in the applicant 's decision to leave the matrimonial home together with the children the applicant and children started living with the maternal grandparents in december the applicant was baptised as a jehovah 's witness there appear to have been only occasional contacts between the applicant 's husband and the children between june and july as the applicant 's husband failed systematically to provide financial support for the upbringing of the children in early the applicant filed in court a request for maintenance on april the court ordered the husband to pay for the support of the children on july the children went to visit their paternal grandparents and on august the grandparents refused to return the children to the applicant the applicant submits that she has had no regular access to the children since then on september the father filed a divorce petition in the leninskiy district court of makhachkala the district court ленинский районный суд г. махачкала he also submitted that he was ready to provide the children with better living and moral conditions than the applicant that the applicant had taken the children to religious meetings with a view to converting them to the faith of the jehovah 's witnesses that the children had become irritable and did not want to return to their mother and requested the court to grant him custody of both children in response the applicant accepted that the marriage had irretrievably broken down but contested the husband 's claim for custody at a preliminary hearing the district court ordered a report on the issue of custody of the children to be prepared by the custody and guardianship agency attached to leninskiy district council of the town of makhachkala the custody and guardianship agency орган опеки и попечительства при администрации ленинского района a letter of instruction dated october contained a request to report on the applicant 's living conditions and to give a conclusion concerning the possibility of leaving the children with her having regard to the fact that the applicant attends meetings of the sect 'jehovah 's witnesses on december an official u. drew up a report on the preliminary inquiry into the applicant 's living conditions the report described the three room flat measuring in total square metres in which the applicant her two parents and three brothers were living and then stated additional information about the applicant 's family the applicant attends meetings of the organisation 'jehovah 's witnesses members of the organisation sometimes meet at her home and study the relevant literature the applicant 's parents are critical of her religion i deem it in the interests of the minor children to be more advisable for them to live with their father in the sergokalinskiy district. on an unspecified date the district court added the report of december to the case-file on december upon the district court 's request the leninskiy district council of the town of the district council администрация ленинского районного г. махачкалы submitted to the court observations заключение in which it advised that custody of the children should be granted to their father the district council reasoned as follows the custody and guardianship agency attached to leninskiy district council of the town of established that the applicant resided in her parents house in she had married mr magomed gazimagomedov from whom she bore two minor children abdul gazimagomedov born in and aminat gazimagomedova born in the spouses resided in the village novomugri of the sergokalinskiy district she worked in a neighbour village as a school teacher his work was related to sea trips as of june spouses gazimagomedovy de facto interrupted their marital relations the children started living with their mother in long before their divorce the applicant began attending meetings of the religious organisation 'jehovah 's witnesses her attendance at these meetings which involved travelling to other towns was the reason for the discord and break-up of the family villagers and relatives spoke out against the conduct of the applicant when living with the children in contrary to her parents will she did not refrain from regularly attending the meetings of the 'jehovah 's witnesses she began actively advocating the ideas of this organisation sometimes her fellow believers gather together at her parents home and they study the relevant literature she would also take her children to the meetings after attending these meetings the children became shy and irritable they perceived the surrounding world and natural phenomena in the way the 'jehovah 's witnesses teaching presents it the children were afraid of the 'worldwide flood whenever it rained they called the applicant 's mother-in-law 'satan they would not attend their classmates birthdays or other celebrations because the religion did not permit this the children 's father was seriously concerned that the children 's association with their mother threatened their upbringing he was against their returning to the minor children are presently living with their father the son is now getting good marks at school on the basis of the aforementioned considering the fact that the parents must provide each child with the possibility of growing healthy physically and spiritually and based on the interests of the minor children the custody and guardianship agency deems it advisable for the children to reside with their father. on march the district court terminated the marriage between the applicant and her husband and granted custody of the children to their father the district court reasoned as follows the spouses married on december then resided in different locations and since in a private house of gazimagomedov in the village of novomugri of the sergokalinskiy district of the they have children in marriage abdula born on may and aminat born on january in june having gone to visit her parents the applicant joined the organisation 'jehovah 's witnesses the family began to have problems and since that time they have not been living together as husband and wife the family has split apart the court fixed them a period for reconciliation but the parties failed to reunite and have requested to terminate their marriage it follows that the family can not be preserved and the marriage should be dissolved from the submissions of the applicant and her mother it transpires that the members of the 'jehovah 's witnesses organisation come to the flat in which the applicant and her parents reside a few times a week to conduct their activities furthermore the applicant attends the weekly meetings of the 'jehovah 's witnesses the applicant 's mother was questioned in court and confirmed the fact that at the beginning her grandchildren had been very afraid of rain and wind and had been saying that a 'worldwide flood and an earthquake would take place that is when the applicant 's mother learned that the applicant had been taking the children to meetings of the sect 'jehovah 's witnesses from the case-file documents and the parties submissions it transpires that at present the applicant 's husband resides along with his parents in the in a two-storey house the household in fact belongs to him for a few months of the year he works at sea and the same amount of time he spends at home the children have been living with him and his parents according to a certificate of a the applicant 's son has excellent results at school the applicant works as a teacher and has good references from a report on her living conditions it transpires that a three-room flat is occupied by the applicant her parents and the applicant 's three brothers the members of the 'jehovah 's witnesses organisation gather at the same place and study the relevant literature according to a report on the applicant 's living conditions and the observations of the custody and guardianship agency 'the parents are obliged to provide their children with an opportunity to grow physically and spiritually healthy regard being had to the interests of the children the custody and guardianship agency considers it appropriate to grant custody of both children to their father the court too is of the view that having regard to the fact that the children have been living with their father for more than five years and have not yet attained the age of and also in the interests of the children as defined by sections and of the rf family code that custody should be granted to their father the applicant and her counsel appealed against the judgment of march to the supreme court of the the supreme court судебная коллегия по гражданским делам верховного суда республики дагестан in her grounds of appeal she argued that the first-instance judgment was discriminatory in that it had been based on the applicant 's affiliation to the jehovah 's witnesses that the first-instance court 's findings were perverse unsustainable and misconstrued that the court had failed to take account of all the factors which were relevant to the case according to section of the family code the father 's frequent absence owing to his work at sea the applicant 's demonstrated pedagogical competence as a professional school teacher a prior and recent history of both parents involvement in the upbringing of their children the father 's allegedly immoral adulterous behaviour etc and that the court had acted on the presumption of the jehovah 's witnesses being a dangerous organisation the applicant also cited domestic jurisprudence in child custody cases and the judgment of june of the european court of human rights in the case of hoffmann v. austria on april the supreme court sitting in a composition of three professional judges examined the applicant 's appeal and by two votes to one rejected it as unfounded in particular the majority established the following in making the decision that the father should have custody of the children the trial court came to the sound conclusion that this was in the best interests of the children the court decision is based on the conclusion of the custody and guardianship agency and the case circumstances established in court thus the court established that the children 's mother who is a member of the jehovah 's witnesses organisation took the children with her to the sect 's meetings and involved them in associating with the sect 's members at their homes she thereby violated the requirements of article of the constitution of the under which everyone is guaranteed freedom of conscience and religion under article of the constitution fundamental human rights are unalienable and belong to everyone at birth the court finds irrelevant the applicant 's arguments that the court by its decision has deprived her of the right to educate her children because of her religion and membership of the jehovah 's witnesses organisation pursuant to article of the constitution and article of the family code the applicant 's exercise of her constitutional rights including the right to practice any religion and her parental rights must not impinge on the rights and freedoms of others or conflict with the interests of the children the right of a parent to educate a child from whom he or she is living apart is guaranteed by section of the family code which defines the procedure for a parent to exercise parental rights the court also established that the applicant 's husband 's financial status and housing conditions are better than those of the applicant the applicant 's husband is employed lives with his parents and owns a two-storey house with the necessary living conditions for the children the paternal grandparents do not object to their grandchildren living with them the applicant works as a history teacher in a school in she lives in her parents three-bedroom flat along with her father mother and three brothers born in and the custody and guardianship agency concluded that it was in the best interests of the children that they remain in the custody of their father the applicant 's argument stated in her appeal that the granting of custody to the father would have negative repercussions on the children 's emotional state in the future was not substantiated the argument that the religious organisation jehovah 's witnesses has state registration benefits society and so forth can not be taken into consideration since it is irrelevant to the matter being examined by the court there are no reasons in the applicant 's appeal to reverse the first-instance judgment handed down in the case the dissenting judge gave the following opinion i hold that the decision handed down by the first-instance court was subject to reversal owing to the failure to investigate the circumstances specified in section of the family code of the rf. the applicant 's subsequent attempts to seek reconsideration of the decisions in her case by way of supervisory review were unsuccessful all her respective requests were dismissed as unfounded the latest decision in this respect was taken by the supreme court of the on november the applicant alleged that her former husband had remarried and that his new wife had not attempted to assume the role or responsibilities of step-mother in the absence of the father who was frequently away at sea the paternal grandmother had effectively become the sole carer the applicant further alleged that she was allowed to visit her children only occasionally and could never remain with them alone the government submitted that according to the information provided by the head of the sergokalinskiy local administration of the the applicant 's children resided with their father and paternal grandparents in a two-storey private house they had all necessary facilities for the upbringing and education of the children their father had remarried and had had a third child the applicant 's children had developed emotional ties with the third child article of the russian constitution of december reads everyone shall be guaranteed the right to freedom of conscience freedom of religion including the right to profess either alone or in community with others any or no religion to choose have and disseminate religious or other convictions freely and to act according to them. section on the exercise of parental rights of the family code of the provides as follows the place of the children 's residence if the parents live apart shall be established by an agreement between the parents in the absence of an agreement the dispute between the parents shall be resolved in court proceeding from the children 's interests and taking into account the children 's opinion in doing so the court shall take into account the child 's affection for each of his parents and for his brothers and sisters the child 's age the moral and other personal characteristics of the parents the relations existing between each of the parents and the child and the possibility of creating

the case originated in an application no against the united kingdom lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by an irish national mrs mary theresa shanaghan the applicant on october the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by mr p. mageean and mr d. korff lawyers practising in the united kingdom the united kingdom government the government were represented by their agent mr c. whomersley of the foreign and commonwealth office the applicant alleged that her son patrick shanaghan was killed by an unknown gunman in circumstances disclosing collusion by members of the security forces and that there was an inadequate investigation into his death she invoked articles and of the convention the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule of the rules of court having consulted the parties the president of the chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of hugh jordan v. the united kingdom no mckerr v. the united kingdom no and kelly and others v. the united kingdom no see judgments of the same date third-party comments were received from the northern ireland human rights commission on march which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule a hearing took place in public in the human rights building on april there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr weatherup and mr korff by a decision of april the chamber declared the application admissible the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits rule the facts of the case in particular concerning the circumstances surrounding the death of patrick shanaghan on august are in dispute between the parties patrick shanaghan was a thirty-year-old catholic and active member of sinn fein when he was killed the royal ulster constabulary the ruc suspected him of being an ira member and that he was involved in terrorism between april and may he was arrested and detained pursuant to investigations into acts of terrorism in northern ireland six of the ten arrests resulted in detention for four or more days he was never charged with any crime patrick shanaghan gave several written statements to his solicitors alleging physical assaults by ruc officers while in custody including being punched in the back punched under the chin with a clenched fist stabbed in the throat with extended fingers slapped in the face having his arms wrenched back and forth repeatedly being forced to keep a crouched position for hours having his head struck against a wall and being hit and kicked in the testicles the applicant alleged that on several occasions ruc detectives threatened to kill her son during interrogations for example by telling him that loyalists in castlederg know you now and they 'll get you during his detention in castlereagh from to april it was recorded that patrick shanaghan complained to a doctor that he had been ill-treated this referred to the pulling of his hair and the forcing back of his fingers the doctor reported this to the custody sergeant who invited patrick shanaghan to make a written statement patrick shanaghan declined to reply he also declined to reply when the custody sergeant asked him if he would be willing to attend a police disciplinary hearing on april patrick shanaghan instituted proceedings against the chief constable of the ruc for alleged assault battery trespass to the person unlawful arrest and unlawful imprisonment in respect of his detention from to april these were discontinued by him on september the applicant also claimed that there was an attempt on patrick shanaghan 's life on february but that he managed to escape the ruc were called but no charges were brought against a suspect for the murder attempt when patrick shanaghan was arrested a year later in february he publicly stated that ruc officers repeatedly mentioned this murder attempt during interrogation and one officer claimed we wo n't miss next time the ruc warned patrick shanaghan twice that he was under potential threat from loyalist paramilitary groups on december a ruc detective informed him that security force documentation containing information about him including a photographic montage had accidentally fallen out of the back of an army vehicle he was advised to take measures for his personal safety as there was a risk that the material had come into the hands of loyalist paramilitaries a letter dated january was sent to the ruc by patrick shanaghan 's solicitors who requested as a matter of urgency in order to assess the risk to his life information relating to the documentation including the type of information lost dates when the information was first recorded the exact date and under what circumstances it went missing copies of photographs and addresses included in the files and information in relation to the social movement and employment of persons involved in handling the files on july over three and a half years later the ruc responded to this letter by stating that the police investigation was concluded and that the document had been accidentally lost by the army on april sergeant norden of the ruc called at mr shanaghan 's home and informed him that he had received information to suggest that he was being targeted by loyalists the government gave further details about the loss of the photographs they stated that on december during the journey of an army patrol vehicle from rockwood base to hump vehicle checkpoint near strabane in county tyrone the rear doors of the vehicle fell open and a helmet armoured vest and combat suit belonging to one of the drivers fell from the vehicle the jacket of the combat suit contained three terrorist recognition photographic montages comprising a total of photographs including some of patrick shanaghan upon arrival it was discovered that the said equipment was missing and a search carried out of the route which resulted in the recovery of the helmet the officer responsible for the missing equipment was cautioned and interviewed by the special investigation branch about the loss of the photographic montages he was subsequently reported and disciplinary proceedings instituted against him the officer attended a disciplinary interview with his brigade commander no formal disciplinary sanction was recorded as imposed although the government stated that it was possible that he received a formal rebuke which would not have been recorded the ruc informed patrick shanaghan promptly of the loss of the photographs there was no evidence who if anyone recovered the photographs or that they played any later role in events patrick shanaghan was stopped and questioned by ruc and udr officers on a daily basis the shanaghan family home which the applicant shared with her son was searched sixteen times between and no illegal material was ever found according to the applicant sometimes the ruc would not even enter certain rooms indicating that the search was not a concerted effort to locate and seize illegal material but was carried out solely to harass the family at about a.m. on august patrick shanaghan was driving his van to his job when he was shot dead by a masked gunman about twenty shots had been fired into the van as it passed down the learmore road in the direction of castlederg the uff ulster freedom fighters a loyalist organisation later claimed responsibility for the murder in the local press ruc officers arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting was reported a scene of crimes officer attended the scene and recovered bullet casings and glass samples the scene was photographed including the tyre impressions these items were analysed by a member of the northern ireland forensic science laboratory the applicant alleged that the behaviour of the police at the scene was not consonant with any concern for her son 's life or proper police procedures claiming that no ambulance was called to the scene and that the police prevented a priest approaching to give the last rites the government stated that no ambulance was called as it was apparent that an ambulance could not have assisted patrick shanaghan when the priest arrived he was initially asked to go to incident control point before approaching the car to enable the officers to make the necessary arrangements for the preservation of the evidence at the scene at p.m. on the same day a post mortem examination disclosed that patrick shanaghan had died from a bullet wound to the chest the police attempted to identify potential eye-witnesses by speaking to all those present at the scene conducting house to house enquiries setting up vehicle check points and making press appeals for witnesses to come forward they also interviewed the police officers who had been attending a road traffic accident to which personnel had been diverted shortly before the shooting occurred the government stated that there had been nothing suspicious in the conduct of the police in this respect three cars had been tasked to attend the road traffic accident at the village of killen it being normal practice for more than one vehicle to respond due to the risk of attacks on the security forces by the provisional ira shortly after the shooting the ruc discovered a car which they believed had been used by the people involved in the shooting however a forensic and fingerprint examination disclosed no evidence to connect it with any person suspected of the murder enquiries showed that the car had been recently bought for cash by unknown persons from a private vendor as later revealed in the inquest the investigating police officer believed that he knew the identity of the persons involved in the killing but had no evidence to prove it several suspects had been arrested and interviewed but no evidence of admission had been obtained from them on january the applicant accepted the sum of pounds sterling from the criminal injuries compensation scheme in respect of the death of her son an inquest into the killing was opened on march over four and a half years after the murder the ruc file had been transmitted to the coroner on january the delay in their inquiries resulted according to the government from the extent of other criminal activities requiring police attention in the castlederg area at that time the inquest was further delayed to february pending the completion of further inquiries required by the coroner no explanation was given to the shanaghan family to account for the delay during this period the family had not known whether any murder investigation had been conducted by the police and were not provided with any indication as to the nature of the ruc 's findings if any as to how the applicant 's son had died the inquest was heard over six days between march and june it was presided over by the coroner who sat with a jury and was assisted by a lawyer the ruc were represented by counsel and a solicitor during the inquest the solicitor acting for the family of patrick shanaghan sought to introduce evidence in support of allegations that the ruc had prior knowledge that he was to be murdered that the ruc had made threats against him and that the police investigation had been inadequate this consisted of evidence from a forensic science consultant who criticised the ruc for not taking a plaster-cast of car tyre impressions found at the scene of the crime and the oral testimony of d.c. who claimed to have been told by patrick shanaghan of threats to his life made by ruc officers and who had heard such threats made by officers when he himself was in custody when the coroner accepted that the evidence should be admitted the ruc chief constable applied for judicial review of those decisions on june the high court quashed the coroner 's decision holding that it is now well-settled in the jurisprudence on this topic that a coroner 's function is not and one may say emphatically not to conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into the broad circumstances in which a deceased has met his death it is now clearly established by the decisions to which i have referred that the word how should receive the connotation by what means and it seems to me that it can not be the case that the evidence in relation to the calibre of the police investigation the quality of the police investigation touches upon the means by which mr. shanaghan was killed rather it is directly relevant to the possible criticism of the standard of the police investigation and that goes well beyond the scope of the inquiry of the coroner by the same token i consider that the evidence from mr d.c. is not germane to the question which the coroner and the jury must decide and that is by what means the deceased met his death evidence has already been given without apparent challenge that the deceased was the target of loyalist terrorists before he was murdered that evidence has not been disputed and is no way controversial and in those circumstances it appears to me that the only issue which mr d.c. 's evidence could shed light upon is whether these threats were uttered by police officers that for the reasons i have already referred to is not a matter for the coroner 's inquest to enquire into the coroner refused to admit in evidence statements made by patrick shanaghan to his solicitors the applicant stated that her original statement was edited by the ruc to exclude references to police collusion when it appeared in a coroner 's deposition on june the coroner 's inquest issued the verdict that patrick shanaghan had died on august on learmore road in castlederg from a bullet wound to the chest on july the applicant made a complaint about the conduct of the ruc at the scene of the shooting in denying dr stewart access to the body and in failing to call an ambulance this complaint was investigated by an assistant chief constable under the supervision of the independent commission for police complaints the icpc as a result of which the inspector concerned was given advice which was recorded in the divisional discipline book a superintendent of the complaints and discipline section of the ruc made attempts to investigate the allegations made by d.c. that during an interview with police ruc officers had made threats against patrick shanaghan see paragraph above by letter of october d.c. 's solicitors replied that their client would not make a statement concerning patrick shanaghan as none had been sought at the time of the incident attempts were made to take statements from three other witnesses mentioned at the inquest only one of whom agreed the ruc officers who had interviewed d.c. on and may were themselves interviewed on june a copy of the unofficial inquiry report was sent by the applicant 's daughter to the secretary of state for northern ireland see below concerning the unofficial inquiry she complained of the failure to make a plaster cast of the tyre tracks at the scene and that constable d. had said that he had been sent to the scene of the shooting at a.m. before it had taken place as a result the ruc conducted further enquiries under the supervision of the icpc and the ruc subsequently reported to the director of public prosecutions the dpp on july the icpc wrote to the applicant 's daughter and son-in-law informing them that the icpc was satisfied by the police investigation which had taken place on november the icpc wrote to the applicant 's daughter to inform her that constable d. would be spoken to about the error which he had made as to the time at which he was detailed to the scene but that no other disciplinary proceedings would be taken in respect of the matters complained of on june they stated that they were satisfied with the action taken in january having considered the results of the ruc 's further enquiries in the light of the unofficial enquiry the dpp decided that there should be no prosecution in relation to the shooting a community inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the murder was organised by family and friends after the conclusion of the inquest in the hope that the whole truth about the murder could be revealed the inquiry conducted by the castlederg-aghyaran justice group and chaired by a retired united states judge andrew somers heard thirteen witnesses over the period from to september the witnesses included family local residents and friends of the deceased evidence was given alleging that police officers had frequently stopped patrick shanaghan in the street and issued threats that the police warned people to keep away from him or they would end up being shot that police officers made comments to persons in custody before the incident that patrick shanaghan would be targeted and after the incident claimed that they had had him killed two witnesses claimed that they had seen patrick shanaghan still moving after the shooting had occurred the judge concluded that the applicant had been murdered by the british government and more specifically with the collusion of the ruc on july the applicant issued a writ against the chief constable of the ruc and by amendment of september against the ministry of defence also the writ was served on july in the proceedings the applicant claimed damages for loss and damage sustained by her and the estate of her son by reason inter alia of negligence breach of confidence and misfeasance in public office relating to the storing handling and use of information on july the defendants gave notice of intention to defend the proceedings no further steps have been taken the conduct of inquests in northern ireland is governed by the coroners act northern ireland and the coroners practice and procedure rules northern ireland these provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the coroner who then has the power to hold an inquest with or without a jury for the purpose of ascertaining with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports inter alia of post mortem and forensic examinations who the deceased was and how when and where he died pursuant to the coroners act every medical practitioner registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the coroner section every medical practitioner who performs a post mortem examination has to notify the coroner of the result in writing section whenever a dead body is found or an unexplained death or death in suspicious circumstances occurs the police of that district are required to give notice to the coroner section rules and of the coroners rules give power to the coroner to adjourn an inquest where a person may be or has been charged with murder or other specified criminal offences in relation to the deceased where the coroner decides to hold an inquest with a jury persons are called from the jury list compiled by random computer selection from the electoral register for the district on the same basis as in criminal trials the matters in issue at an inquest are governed by rules and of the coroners rules the proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters namely a who the deceased was b how when and where the deceased came by his death c the particulars for the time being required by the births and deaths registration northern ireland order to be registered concerning his death neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any matters other than those referred to in the last foregoing rule. the forms of verdict used in northern ireland accord with this recommendation recording the name and other particulars of the deceased a statement of the cause of death e.g bullet wounds and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death in england and wales the form of verdict appended to the english coroners rules contains a section marked conclusions of the jury/coroner as to the death in which conclusions such as lawfully killed or killed unlawfully are inserted these findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable the jury in england and wales may also append recommendations to their verdict however in northern ireland the coroner is under a duty section of the prosecution of offences order northern ireland to furnish a written report to the dpp where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed until recently legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges legislation which would have provided for legal aid at the hearing of inquests the legal aid advice and assistance northern ireland order schedule paragraph has not been brought into force however on july the lord chancellor announced the establishment of an extra-statutory ex gratia scheme to make public funding available for representation for proceedings before coroners in exceptional inquests in northern ireland in march he published for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether applications for representation at inquests should receive public funding this included inter alia consideration of financial eligibility whether an effective investigation by the state was needed and whether the inquest was the only way to conduct it whether the applicant required representation to be able to participate effectively in the inquest and whether the applicant had a sufficiently close relationship to the deceased the coroner enjoys the power to summon witnesses who he thinks it necessary to attend the inquest section of the coroners act and he may allow any interested person to examine a witness rule in both england and wales and northern ireland a witness is entitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination in northern ireland this privilege is reinforced by rule which provides that a person suspected of causing the death may not be compelled to give evidence at the inquest in relation to both documentary evidence and the oral evidence of witnesses inquests like criminal trials are subject to the law of public interest immunity which recognises and gives effect to the public interest such as national security in the non-disclosure of certain information or certain documents or classes of document a claim of public interest immunity must be supported by a certificate rules and see above follow from the recommendation of the brodrick committee on death certification and coroners the function of an inquest should be simply to seek out and record as many of the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires without deducing from those facts any determination of blame in many cases perhaps the majority the facts themselves will demonstrate quite clearly whether anyone bears any responsibility for the death there is a difference between a form of proceeding which affords to others the opportunity to judge an issue and one which appears to judge the issue itself. domestic courts have made inter alia the following comments it is noteworthy that the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died which might raise general and far-reaching issues but 'how the deceased came by his death a far more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death previous judgments make it clear that when the brodrick committee stated that one of the purposes of an inquest is 'to allay rumours or suspicions this purpose should be confined to allaying rumours and suspicions of how the deceased came by his death and not to allaying rumours or suspicions about the broad circumstances in which the deceased came by his death. sir thomas bingham mr court of appeal r. v the coroner for north humberside and scunthorpe ex parte roy jamieson april unreported the cases establish that although the word 'how is to be widely interpreted it means 'by what means rather than in what broad circumstances in short the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative of death and must indeed be confined to those matters alone simon brown lj court of appeal r. v. coroner for western district of east sussex ex parte homberg and others jp it should not be forgotten that an inquest is a fact finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt the procedure and rules of evidence which are suitable for one are unsuitable for the other in an inquest it should never be forgotten that there are no parties no indictment there is no prosecution there is no defence there is no trial simply an attempt to establish the facts it is an inquisitorial process a process of investigation quite unlike a trial it is well recognised that a purpose of an inquest is that rumour may be allayed but that does not mean it is the duty of the coroner to investigate at an inquest every rumour or allegation that may be brought to his attention it is his duty to discharge his statutory role the scope of his enquiry must not be allowed to drift into the uncharted seas of rumour and allegation he will proceed safely and properly if he investigates the facts which it appears are relevant to the statutory issues before him. lord lane court of appeal r. v. south london coroner ex parte thompson sj there was no requirement prior to for the families at inquests to receive copies of the written statements or documents submitted to the coroner during the inquest coroners generally adopted the practice of disclosing the statements or documents during the inquest proceedings as the relevant witness came forward to give evidence following the recommendation of the stephen lawrence inquiry home office circular no concerning deaths in custody or deaths resulting from the actions of a police officer in purported execution of his duty advised chief constables of police forces in england and wales to make arrangements in such cases for the pre-inquest disclosure of documentary evidence to interested parties this was to help provide reassurance to the family of the deceased and other interested persons that a full and open police investigation has been conducted and that they and their legal representatives will not be disadvantaged at the inquest such disclosure was recommended to take place days before the inquest paragraph of the circular stated the courts have established that statements taken by the police and other documentary material produced by the police during the investigation of a death in police custody are the property of the force commissioning the investigation the coroner has no power to order the pre-inquest disclosure of such material disclosure will therefore be on a voluntary basis. paragraph listed some kinds of material which require particular consideration before being disclosed for example where disclosure of documents might have a prejudicial effect on possible subsequent proceedings criminal civil or disciplinary where the material concerns sensitive or personal information about the deceased or unsubstantiated allegations which might cause distress to the family and personal information about third parties not material to the inquest paragraph envisaged that there would be non-disclosure of the investigating officer 's report although it might be possible to disclose it in those cases which the chief constable considered appropriate the police complaints procedure was governed at the relevant time by the police northern ireland order the order this replaced the police complaints board which had been set up in by the independent commission for police complaints the icpc the icpc has been replaced from october with the police ombudsman for northern ireland appointed under the police northern ireland act the icpc was an independent body consisting of a chairman two deputy chairmen and at least four other members where a complaint against the police was being investigated by a police officer or where the chief constable or secretary of state considered that a criminal offence might have been committed by a police officer the case was referred to the icpc the icpc was required under article a of the order to supervise the investigation of any complaint alleging that the conduct of a ruc officer had resulted in death or serious injury its approval was required of the appointment of the police officer to conduct the investigation and it could require the investigating officer to be replaced article b a report by the investigating officer was submitted to the icpc concerning supervised investigations at the same time as to the chief constable pursuant to article of the order the icpc issued a statement whether the investigation had been conducted to its satisfaction and if not specifying any respect in which it had not been so conducted the chief constable was required under article of the order to determine whether the report indicated that a criminal offence had been committed by a member of the police force if he so decided and considered that the officer ought to be charged he was required to send a copy of the report to the dpp if the dpp decided not to prefer criminal charges the chief constable was required to send a memorandum to the icpc indicating whether he intended to bring disciplinary proceedings against the officer article save where disciplinary proceedings had been brought and the police officer had admitted the charges article where the chief constable considered that a criminal offence had been committed but that the offence was not such that the police officer should be charged or where he considered that no criminal offence had been committed he was required to send a memorandum indicating whether he intended to bring disciplinary charges and if not his reasons for not proposing to do so article and if the icpc considered that a police officer subject to investigation ought to be charged with a criminal offence it could direct the chief constable to send the dpp a copy of the report on that investigation article it could also recommend or direct the chief constable to prefer such disciplinary charges as the icpc specified article and the director of public prosecutions the dpp appointed pursuant to the prosecution of offences northern ireland the order is an independent officer with at least years experience of the practice of law in northern ireland who is appointed by the attorney general and who holds office until retirement subject only to dismissal for misconduct his duties under article of the order are inter alia a to consider or cause to be considered with a view to his initiating or continuing in northern ireland any criminal proceedings or the bringing of any appeal or other proceedings in or in connection with any criminal cause or matter in northern ireland any facts or information brought to his notice whether by the chief constable acting in pursuance of article of this order or by the attorney general or by any other authority or person b to examine or cause to be examined all documents that are required under article of this order to be transmitted or furnished to him and where it appears to him to be necessary or appropriate to do so to cause any matter arising thereon to be further investigated c where he thinks proper to initiate undertake and carry on on behalf of the crown proceedings for indictable offences and for such summary offences or classes of summary offences as he considers should be dealt with by him. article of the order requires inter alia coroners and the chief constable of the ruc to provide information to the dpp as follows where the circumstances of any death investigated or being investigated by a coroner appear to him to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed he shall as soon as practicable furnish to the dpp a written report of those circumstances it shall be the duty of the chief constable from time to time to furnish to the dpp facts and information with respect to a indictable offences such as murder alleged to have been committed against the law of northern ireland and at the request of the dpp to ascertain and furnish to the dpp information regarding any matter which may appear to the dpp to require investigation on the ground that it may involve an offence against the law of northern ireland or information which may appear to the dpp to be necessary for the discharge of his functions under this order. according to the government 's observations submitted on june it had been the practice of successive dpps to refrain from giving reasons for decisions not to institute or proceed with criminal prosecutions other than in the most general terms this practice was based upon the consideration that if reason were given in one or more cases they would be required to be given in all otherwise erroneous conclusions might be drawn in relation to those cases where reasons were refused involving either unjust implications regarding the guilt of some individuals or suspicions of malpractice the reason not to prosecute might often be the unavailability of a particular item of evidence essential to establish the case e.g sudden death or flight of a witness or intimidation to indicate such a factor as the sole reason for not prosecuting might lead to assumptions of guilt in the public estimation the publication of the reasons might cause pain or damage to persons other than the suspect e.g the assessment of the credibility or mental condition of the victim or other witnesses in a substantial category of cases decisions not to prosecute were based on the dpp 's assessment of the public interest where the sole reason not to prosecute was the age mental or physical health of the suspect publication would not be appropriate and could lead to unjust implications there might be considerations of national security which affected the safety of individuals e.g where no prosecution could safely or fairly be brought without disclosing information which would be of assistance to terrorist organisations would impair the effectiveness of the counter-terrorist operations of the security forces or endanger the lives of such personnel and their families or informants decisions of the dpp not to prosecute have been subject to applications for judicial review in the high court in r. v. dpp ex parte c car p. lord justice kennedy held concerning a decision of the dpp not to prosecute in an alleged case of buggery from all of those decisions it seems to me that in the context of the present case this court can be persuaded to act if and only if it is demonstrated to us that the director of public prosecutions acting through the crown prosecution service arrived at the decision not to prosecute because of some unlawful policy such as the hypothetical decision in blackburn not to prosecute where the value of goods stolen was below because the director of public prosecutions failed to act in accordance with his own settled policy as set out in the code or because the decision was perverse it was a decision at which no reasonable prosecutor could have arrived. in the case of r. v. the dpp and others ex parte timothy jones the divisional court on march quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the dpp that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury required further explanation r v. dpp ex parte patricia manning and elizabeth manning decision of the divisional court of may concerned the dpp 's decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous the dpp reviewing the case still concluded that the crown would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence the lord chief justice noted authority makes clear that a decision by the director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review see for example r. v. director of public prosecutions ex parte c cr app r. but as the decided cases also make clear the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised the reasons for this are clear the primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by parliament to the director as head of an independent professional prosecuting service answerable to the attorney general in his role as guardian of the public interest and to no-one else it makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the cps as it was here and not by the director personally in any borderline case the decision may be one of acute difficulty since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial if in a case such as the present the director 's provisional decision is not to prosecute that decision will be subject to review by senior treasury counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment the director and his officials and senior treasury counsel when consulted will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match in most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant if brought would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before in a serious case such as this a jury this exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength by the end of the trial of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences it will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it so the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere at the same time the standard of review should not be set too high since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied. as regards whether the dpp had a duty to give reasons the lord chief justice said it is not contended that the director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet mr blake 's conditions set out above we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of the european court of human rights to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute but the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights it is put at the forefront of the convention the power to derogate from it is very limited the death of a person in the custody of the state must always arouse concern as recognised by section c b and of the coroner 's act and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the state that concern must be profound the holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official the coroner in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry see mccann v. united kingdom ehrr paragraphs to where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who although not named in the verdict is clearly identified who is living and whose whereabouts are known the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow in the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons we would expect the director to give reasons in such a case to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given to vindicate the director 's decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet the european court 's expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given we would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to members of parliament whose constituents have died in such circumstances we readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves we also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision but the number of cases which meet mr blake 's conditions is very small we were told that since including deaths in police custody there have been seven such cases and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review in any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require. on this basis the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the dpp in that case were in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute it found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute the decision was quashed and the dpp was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute in the matter of an application by david adams for judicial review the high court in northern ireland on june considered the applicant 's claim that the dpp had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police it noted that there was no statutory obligation on the dpp under the order to give reasons and considered that not duty to give reasons could be implied the fact that the dpp in england and wales had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim 's families was a matter for his discretion it concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the manning case paragraph above would the dpp be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by lord justice kennedy paragraph above were infringed notwithstanding the findings in the civil case they were not persuaded that the dpp had acted in such an aberrant inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted the united nations basic principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials un force and firearms principles were adopted on september by the eighth united nations congress on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders paragraph of the un force and firearms principles provides inter alia that the intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life other relevant provisions read as follows paragraph law enforcement officials shall identify themselves as such and shall give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms with sufficient time for the warnings to be observed unless to do so would unduly place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to other persons or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the incident. paragraph governments and law enforcement agencies shall ensure that an effective review process is available and that independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to exercise jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances in cases of death and serious injury or other grave consequences a detailed report shall be sent promptly to the competent authorities responsible for administrative review and judicial control. paragraph persons affected by the use of force and firearms or their legal representatives shall have access to an independent process including a judicial process in the event of the death of such persons this provision shall apply to their dependants accordingly. paragraph of the united nations principles on the effective prevention and investigation of extra-legal arbitrary and summary executions adopted on may by the economic and social council resolution un principles on extra-legal executions provides inter alia that there shall be a thorough prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra legal arbitrary and summary executions including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances paragraphs to of the un principles on extra-legal executions contain a series of detailed requirements that should be observed by investigative procedures into such deaths paragraph states inter alia the investigative authority shall have the power to obtain all the information necessary to the inquiry those persons conducting the inquiry shall also have the authority to oblige officials allegedly involved in any such executions to appear and testify paragraph specifies in cases in which the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of a lack of expertise or impartiality because of the importance of the matter or because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse and in cases where there are complaints from the family of the victim about these inadequacies or other substantial reasons governments shall pursue investigations through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure members of such a commission shall be chosen for their recognised impartiality competence and independence as individuals in particular they shall be independent of any institution agency or person that may be the subject of the inquiry the commission shall have the authority to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry and shall conduct the inquiry as provided in these principles. paragraph provides inter alia families of the deceased and their legal representatives shall be informed of and have access to any hearing as well as all information relevant to the investigation and shall be entitled to present other evidence paragraph provides inter alia a written report shall be made within a reasonable time on the methods and findings of such investigations the report shall be made public immediately and shall include the scope of the inquiry procedures methods used to evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and recommendations based on findings of fact and on applicable law the minnesota protocol model protocol for a legal investigation of extra-legal arbitrary and summary executions contained in the un manual on the effective prevention and investigation of extra-legal arbitrary and summary executions provides inter alia in section b on the purposes of an inquiry as set out in paragraph of the principles the broad purpose of an inquiry is to discover the truth about the events leading to the suspicious death of a victim to fulfil that purpose those conducting the inquiry shall at a minimum seek a to identify the victim b to recover and preserve evidentiary material related to the death to aid in any potential prosecution of those responsible c to identify possible witnesses and obtain statements from them concerning the death d to determine the cause manner location and time of death as well as any pattern or practice that may have brought about the death e to distinguish between natural death accidental death suicide and homicide f to identify and apprehend the person s involved in the death g to bring the suspected perpetrator s before a competent court established by law. in section d it is stated that in cases where government involvement is suspected an objective and impartial investigation may not be possible unless a special commission of inquiry is established in the report on its visit to the united kingdom and the isle of man from to september published on january the european committee for the prevention of torture the cpt reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill-treating persons it commented inter alia on the statistically few criminal prosecutions and disciplinary proceedings which were brought and identified certain aspects of the procedures which cast doubt on their effectiveness the chief officers appointed officers from the same force to conduct the investigations save in exceptional cases where they appointed an officer from another force and the majority of investigations were unsupervised by the police complaints authority it stated at paragraph as already indicated the cpt itself entertains reservations about whether the pca the police complaints authority even equipped with the enhanced powers which have been proposed will be capable of persuading public opinion that complaints against the police are vigorously investigated in the view of the cpt the creation of a fully-fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development such a body should certainly like the pca have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers further in the interests of bolstering public confidence it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the cps for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought in any event the cpt recommends that the role of the 'chief officer within the existing system be reviewed to take the example of one metropolitan police officer to whom certain of the chief officer 's functions have been delegated the director of the cib criminal investigations bureau he is currently expected to seek dispensations from the pca appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work determine whether an investigating officer 's report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer 's report and liase with the pca on this question determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges in civil cases negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court it is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way reference should also be made to the high degree of public interest in cps crown prosecution service decisions regarding the prosecution of police officers especially in cases involving allegations of serious misconduct confidence about the manner in which such decisions are reached would certainly be strengthened were the cps to be obliged to give detailed reasons in cases where it was decided that no criminal proceedings should be brought the cpt recommends that such a requirement be introduced,case originated application united kingdom lodged european commission

citizenship for internal purposes that is they were citizens both of the sfry and of one of the six republics until federal citizenship prevailed over republic citizenship republic citizenship could only be held by a yugoslav citizen the regulation of citizenship was similar in all republics of the sfry with the basic principle of acquiring citizenship by blood jus sanguinis in principle a child acquired his or her parents citizenship if the parents were citizens of different republics they jointly agreed on their child s citizenship on the date of acquisition of the citizenship of another republic a person s prior republic citizenship came to an end from a separate register of citizenship was kept at the level of the republics and not at the level of the federal state from the citizenship data for newly born children were entered in the register of births and from the entry of data in the register of citizenship ended all citizenship data being entered in the register of

approximately slovenian residents or of the population including the applicants were citizens of the other former sfry republics this proportion also broadly reflects the ethnic origin of the slovenian population at that time in accordance with the statement of good intentions section of the constitutional law provided that those citizens of other republics of the former sfry who on december the date of the plebiscite on the independence of slovenia were registered as permanent residents of the republic of slovenia and actually lived there held equal rights and duties to citizens of the republic of slovenia with the exception of the acquisition of property until they acquired citizenship of the republic of slovenia under section of the citizenship act or until the expiry of the time-limit set out in section of the aliens act december see paragraphs and below section of the citizenship act which entered into force on june provided that citizens of the former sfry

either failed to apply for slovenian citizenship within the prescribed time-limit or whose requests were not granted became aliens the provisions of the aliens act became applicable to the former sfry citizens either two months after the expiry of the time-limit that is by february or two months after a decision issued in administrative proceedings rejecting their application for citizenship became

that citizens of other sfry republics living in slovenia were henceforth considered aliens in all administrative proceedings and that in accordance with section of the constitutional law they held equal rights and duties to citizens of the republic of slovenia until the expiry of the relevant time-limits see paragraph above it further gave technical instructions in the field of passports and aliens on july the ministry informed the municipal administrative authorities that further to the brioni declaration between the european community ministerial troika and representatives of slovenia croatia serbia and the enforcement of the independence legislation in the sphere of internal affairs had been suspended for a period of three months during this period citizens of other sfry republics would not be treated as aliens two further administrative circulars were issued on and february drawing attention to the general problems relating to the implementation of the aliens act the former circular stated that when administering matters concerning the status of aliens the personal documents of citizens of other sfry republics issued by the slovenian administrative authorities should be kept and their passports revoked and destroyed on february the date on which the second subsection of section of the aliens act became applicable the municipal administrative authorities removed those who had not applied for or obtained slovenian citizenship from the register of permanent residents register stalnega prebivalstva the register and according to the government transferred them into the register of aliens without a residence permit on february the ministry indicated in its instructions to the municipal administrative authorities that it would be necessary to regulate the legal status of these persons it drew their attention to the fact that numerous problems were expected to arise the legal status of the persons concerned should be regulated and in parallel the clearing of records should be undertaken in addition the ministry pointed out that the papers of such persons even if issued by the slovenian authorities and formally valid would in fact become invalid owing to the persons change in status ex lege the ministry also gave an interpretation of sections and of the aliens act in cases of cancellation of residence and forcible removal the applicants stated that persons whose names were removed from the register received no official notification they pointed out that no special procedure was provided for to that effect and no official documents were issued they only subsequently became aware that they had become aliens when for example they attempted to renew their personal documents personal identification card passport driving licence the government however maintained that in addition to the publication in the official gazette the slovenian population was informed about the new legislation through public media and notices in some municipalities personal means of notification were allegedly also used according to official data from the number of former sfry citizens who had lost their permanent residence status on february amounted to of whom approximately had been refused citizenship they became known as the erased izbrisani and included the applicants in the present case new data on the erased were collected in see paragraph below as a result the erased became aliens or stateless persons illegally residing in in general they had difficulties in keeping their jobs and driving licences and obtaining retirement pensions nor were they able to leave the country because they could not re-enter without valid documents many families became divided with some of their members in and others in one of the other successor states to the former sfry among the erased were minors in most cases their identity papers were taken away some of the erased voluntarily left some were served with removal orders and deported from after february the registration of permanent residence of citizens of other former sfry republics was terminated if they had not acquired a new residence permit however under section of the aliens act permanent residence permits issued to foreigners with citizenship of states other than the former sfry republics continued to be valid after the entry into force of the aliens act see paragraph below on june the then minister for the interior sent a letter no to the government informing them of the questions that remained open relating to the implementation of the aliens act in view of the large number of persons from the other republics of the former sfry living in without a regulated status he also stated that in his view during the process of independence all the rights of citizens of other sfry republics living in as resulting from international conventions and bilateral treaties had been taken into account the government maintained that further to this letter they took action in order to attenuate the consequences of the erasure by interpreting the provisions of the aliens act in a more flexible manner see paragraph below in addition on june another administrative circular with instructions on the implementation of the aliens act was sent to the municipal administrative authorities it addressed a number of open questions relating to such matters as the allocation of military apartments registration of temporary refugees from the keeping of records transmission of personal information from the population register and proceedings involving aliens personal identification cards issued to aliens by the slovenian authorities were to be destroyed in particular as far as former sfry citizens with permanent residence in slovenia were concerned it specified the dates to be entered in the register either when they became slovenian citizens or when they became aliens under section of the aliens act february or two months after the date of receipt of the decision not to grant slovenian citizenship on june the convention took effect in respect of the slovenian parliament submitted a request for a referendum on the question whether or not citizenship granted to former sfry citizens on the basis of section of the citizenship act should be withdrawn on november the held that the request was unconstitutional in the years that followed several non-governmental organisations including amnesty international and helsinki monitor and the slovenian human rights ombudsman issued reports drawing attention to the situation of the erased on june the declared partly admissible a challenge to the constitutionality of the first subsection of section and the second subsection of section of the aliens act see paragraphs above and below brought in by two individuals whose names had been removed from the register in in a decision of february the declared that section of the aliens act was unconstitutional since it had not set out the conditions for acquisition of permanent residence for those subject to its second subsection it noted that the authorities had deleted from the register the names of citizens of the former sfry republics who had not applied for slovenian citizenship and entered them ex proprio motu in the register of aliens without any notification it further found that there was no legal basis for this measure the inhabitants evidence of residence and population registry act did not provide for ex lege deregistration the provisions of the aliens act were in general designed to regulate the status of aliens who entered after independence not of those who were already living there while section of the aliens act did regulate the legal status of aliens originating from outside the former sfry republics no similar provision existed in respect of persons from the former sfry as a consequence the latter were in a less favourable legal position than aliens who had lived in since before independence a proposal had been made in the legislative process in for a special provision regulating the temporary situation of former sfry citizens living in who had not applied for slovenian citizenship the legislature had maintained that their situation should not be regulated by the aliens act but rather by an agreement between the successor states to the former sfry since the relevant agreements had not been concluded notably because of the state of war in croatia and in their situation remained unaddressed in the constitutional court s view in the light of modern developments in human-rights protection the situation of persons who had held the nationality of the predecessor but not of the successor state with permanent residence on the that had disintegrated after had become a matter governed by international agreements section was therefore declared unconstitutional as it did not prescribe the conditions under which persons who either failed to apply for or were denied slovenian citizenship could apply for permanent residence after the expiry of the prescribed time-limit a legal void had thus formed and the principles of the rule of law legal certainty and equality had been breached furthermore the provisions of the aliens act regulating the acquisition of permanent and temporary residence for aliens entering slovenia sections and of the aliens act see paragraph below should not be used to regulate the status of citizens of the former sfry republics who had a reasonable expectation that the new conditions for retaining permanent residence in slovenia would not be stricter than those set forth in section of the constitutional law see paragraph below and section of the citizenship act see paragraph below and that their status would be determined in accordance with international law the further found that section of the aliens act was not unconstitutional because it applied only to aliens entering after independence the legislature was given six months in which to modify the unconstitutional provisions in the meantime the ruled that no citizen of the former sfry who was registered as a permanent resident in slovenia on december and was actually residing there could be forcibly removed from pursuant to section of the aliens act the also pointed out that the unregulated situation of citizens of the former sfry republics who had found themselves in a precarious legal position could lead to a violation of inter alia the right to respect for family life as protected by article of the convention extracts of this decision are quoted in paragraph below as a consequence the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in slovenia zakon o urejanju statusa državljanov drugih držav naslednic nekdanje sfrj v republiki sloveniji the legal status act was passed on july to regulate the legal status of the erased by simplifying the requirements for acquiring a permanent residence permit under section of the legal status act citizens of other successor states to the former sfry who were registered as permanent residents on slovenian territory on december the date of the plebiscite or on june the date of independence and had been actually resident there were entitled to a permanent residence permit regardless of the provisions of the aliens act they had three months to submit an application section of the legal status act provided for some exceptions for those with criminal convictions residence permits were granted ex nunc to those fulfilling the above conditions see paragraph below ruling on another constitutional challenge on may the set aside one part of section of the legal status act as unconstitutional because it found that the requirements for the acquisition of permanent residence set forth therein were stricter than the grounds for revoking a permanent residence permit under the aliens act relying on its leading decision of february see paragraphs above the has given several decisions in individual cases brought by some of the erased on july it examined the case of a claimant who had been refused the renewal of his driving licence because of the erasure of his name from the register the noted that following its decision of february the legal status act had been drafted but had not yet been passed it decided that until the legal status act entered into force the claimant should enjoy the status he would have had before the expiry of the time-limit set forth in the second subsection of section of the aliens act see paragraph above the administrative authorities were ordered to register the claimant as a permanent resident at the address where he had been living before his name was illegally deleted from the register and to renew his driving licence a similar decision was adopted on july with regard to claimants who were all members of one family and citizens of one of the former sfry republics and had been denied permanent residence under section of the aliens act because the father had lost his job on november and december in cases concerning the payment of a military pension to two erased persons the quashed the judgment of the supreme court and sent the case back for re-examination on september in a case concerning an individual s right to a childcare allowance the quashed the decisions of the lower authorities and sent the case back for reexamination furthermore the has examined a number of cases brought by erased persons concerning the conditions for acquiring slovenian citizenship in a decision of july it held that the condition of actually residing in slovenia in section of the citizenship act see paragraphs above and below could be fulfilled in a situation where a person s residence in slovenia had been interrupted on justifiable grounds if there were other circumstances proving that the centre of his or her life interests was on slovenian territory it quashed the supreme court s decision because there had been differential treatment of analogous cases and sent the case back for re-examination on april ruling on a challenge to the constitutionality of the legal status act in its version of july in a case brought by the association of the erased and by other erased persons the constitutional court found the legal status act unconstitutional because it did not grant retrospective permanent residence from the date of the erasure it did not define the meaning of the words actually residing which appeared in section and it failed to regulate the acquisition of permanent residence for citizens of former sfry republics who had been forcibly removed from slovenia pursuant to section of the aliens act although the exact number of those deported was unknown the considered that the numbers would probably be low since the unregulated status of the erased had generally been tolerated it also struck down the three-month time-limit for submitting applications for permanent residence because it was unreasonably short and ordered the legislature to rectify the unconstitutional provisions of the impugned act within six months the further observed that permanent residence was important in securing certain rights and benefits such as military pension rights social allowances and renewals of driving licences in point no of the operative part of the decision the constitutional court ordered the ministry to issue ex proprio motu decisions establishing permanent residence in slovenia ex tunc with effect from february the date of the erasure to those who already had ex nunc non-retroactive permits in accordance with the legal status act or the aliens act extracts of this decision are quoted in paragraph below on november parliament enacted the act on the application of point no of the constitutional court s decision no zakon o izvršitvi točke odločbe ustavnega sodišča republike slovenije št also known as the technical act this act laid down the procedure for issuing ex tunc permanent residence permits to citizens of the former sfry republics who had been registered as permanent residents in slovenia on both december and february and who had already acquired a permanent residence permit under the legal status act or the aliens act however a referendum on whether the technical act should be implemented was held on april the turnout was of valid votes were against its implementation and therefore the act never entered into force in the meantime in a decision handed down on december the constitutional court specified that the legal basis for the issuance of the supplementary residence permits by the ministry was its decision of april see paragraphs above the ministry was under an obligation to implement the decision furthermore in an individual case brought by one of the erased claiming that his absence from slovenia was due to the state of war on march the constitutional court set aside the judgments of the supreme court dismissing the claimant s request for a permanent residence permit under the legal status act and remitted the case to the administrative court it instructed the latter to make an appropriate assessment of the legal condition of actually residing on the territory of the republic of slovenia from december onwards and of the reasons for the claimant s absence from in particular the held that the fact that the legislature had been late in eliminating the inconsistencies did not prevent the courts from determining the case in conformity with its decision of april see paragraphs above in the ministry issued retroactive permits to the erased solely on the basis of the above-mentioned decision the issuing of these permits by the authorities ex proprio motu was temporarily stayed and resumed in further to a change in government see paragraph below according to the government applications had been submitted under the legal status act by june as a result permanent residence permits were issued following the parliamentary elections held on september a new government was appointed in november the regulation of the status of the erased in compliance with the constitutional court s decisions was established as one of its priorities further to an upgrading of the it system the ministry collected new data on the erased and issued a report stating that on january the number of the people removed from the register amounted to of whom had subsequently acquired slovenian citizenship of them were still alive a further had acquired a residence permit erased persons did not have a regulated status in on that date and their current residence was unknown in the ministry resumed the process of issuing ex proprio motu decisions establishing permanent residence in slovenia ex tunc with effect from february under point no of the operative part of the constitutional court s decision of see paragraph above to those who were already in possession of ex nunc permits such decisions were issued subsequently the ministry prepared amendments and supplements to the legal status act the amended legal status act regulating the incompatibilities between the legal status act and the constitution following the constitutional court s decision of april in particular in respect of those who had been deported and those who had had to leave slovenia because of other reasons related to the erasure on march the amended legal status act was passed on march thirty-one parliamentarians requested that a referendum be held on the amended legal status act inter alia because it did not regulate the question of compensation for the erased as a result its entry into force was postponed on march the national assembly decided that the postponement of the entry into force of the amended legal status act or its rejection in a referendum would have unconstitutional consequences and referred the matter to the in its decision of june the relied on its previous leading decisions and found that the provisions of the amended legal status act were consistent with the constitution the amended act was considered to provide for a permanent solution to the status of those erased persons who had been unable to regularise their status including that of their children and for the issuing of special retroactive decisions to those of them who had been granted slovenian citizenship without the requirement of having a prior permanent residence permit the refused to allow a referendum to be held considering that the potential rejection of the amended legal status act would lead to unconstitutional consequences it further found that the delay in implementing its leading decision of had entailed a fresh violation of the constitution in paragraph of its decision the constitutional court held that by passing the act in question which provided for the retroactivity of permanent residence status the legislature had introduced moral satisfaction as a particular form of reparation for the erased if damage was caused to individuals as a result of their erasure the question of possible state liability could arise on the basis of article of the constitution if other conditions provided for by that article and the relevant statutory conditions were met in any event the amended legal status act on its own did not entail a new type of state liability for damage or a new legal basis for enforcing claims for damages it was legitimate for the legislature to pass specific legislation limiting the state s liability as had been done for instance in respect of the victims of the second world war the held that the fact that the amended legal status act did not address the question of financial reparation was not unconstitutional on june the president of the national assembly publicly apologised to the erased the minister for the interior did the same on june on june the amended legal status act was published in the official gazette it entered into force on july a few days after the delivery of the chamber judgment prior to its enactment requests for residence permits had been submitted of which had been granted section of the amended legal status act applied to aliens who had been citizens of other former sfry republics on june had been registered as having their permanent residence in slovenia on december or on june and had actually resided there since then regardless of the provisions of the aliens act it provided for the acquisition of both ex nunc and ex tunc permanent residence permits by the erased it also regulated the status of the children of the erased and provided for the issuing of retroactive decisions to those erased persons who had been granted slovenian citizenship without having obtained a permanent residence permit in particular section č defined the meaning of the words actually residing in slovenia which was a precondition for obtaining permanent residence status as a situation where the person had the centre of his or her life interests in slovenia this being determined on the basis of personal family economic social and other ties demonstrating the existence of actual and permanent connections between the individual and slovenia it further indicated that the condition of actually residing could be met in cases of justifiable absence for more than a year forced removal from absence as a consequence of the erasure or impossibility of returning because of the state of war in other successor states of the sfry in the case of a longer absence the condition of actually residing could be satisfied for the period of five years and for a further five years only if the person had tried to return to see paragraph below according to the data submitted by the government from june to may the territorial administrative units received applications for ex nunc permanent residence permits and eighty-four applications for supplementary ex tunc permits including the permits issued by the ministry of the interior these applications resulted in the issuing of sixty-four ex nunc permanent residence permits and ex tunc permanent residence permits in some cases by the authorities ex proprio motu further proceedings were still pending the deadline for submitting requests under the amended legal status act expires on july on april an association civil initiative of the erased together with fifty-two other private individuals lodged a petition with the for constitutional review of the amended legal status act the proceedings are currently pending furthermore one of the erased lodged a constitutional appeal challenging the rejection by the supreme court of his compensation claim amounting to euros eur for loss of work and non-pecuniary damage as far as pecuniary damage was concerned the supreme court observed that the state authorities had not acted unlawfully and that article of the constitution was therefore inapplicable on july the rejected the constitutional appeal upholding the supreme court s view that in spite of the decision of the subsequently abrogating the impugned provision of the citizenship act it could not be said that administrative authorities or courts had acted unlawfully at the material time furthermore since the loss of work had been related to the refusal to grant slovenian citizenship to the claimant and not to the refusal to grant a permanent residence permit the leading decisions of the on the subject of the erasure could not be taken into account on july the government submitted some thirty final judgments delivered by the courts of first and second instance and by the supreme court in compensation proceedings brought by the erased all the compensation claims were in the end dismissed mostly for failure to comply with the prescribed time-limits although the courts had in some cases initially established that the compensation claims were well-founded at that time proceedings in eleven cases brought by erased persons were pending before the supreme court finally on november the government submitted a new decision delivered by the on september in a case brought by one of the erased who had claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage in that case the first-instance court had initially held in an interim judgment that there were grounds for holding the state liable for damages however the supreme court upheld the second-instance decision dismissing the claim on account of the expiry of the statutory time-limit that decision was endorsed by the before june the date on which slovenia declared its independence

parts of the constitutional court s decision of february see paragraphs above read as follows at the session of february concerning the proceedings for the review of constitutionality commenced on the initiative of b.m and v.t the constitutional court gave the following decision the aliens act official gazette of rs nos and is inconsistent with the constitution in that it fails to determine the conditions for the acquisition of a permanent residence permit by the persons referred to in subsection of section upon the expiry of the period during which they had the possibility of applying for citizenship of the republic of slovenia if they did not do so or after the date on which the decision on refusal to grant citizenship became final the inconsistency as established in paragraph of the operative provisions shall be eliminated by the legislature within six months from the date of publication of this decision in the official gazette of the pending the elimination of the inconsistency established in paragraph above no deportation order as referred to in section of the aliens act shall be made against citizens of any other republic of the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia if on the date of the plebiscite of december they were registered as having permanent residence in and are actually resident in the republic of slovenia reasons the constitutional court finds that the provisions of subsection of section and subsection of section of the aliens act should not apply to citizens of other republics who have not acquired the citizenship of the neither should the competent authorities have transferred these persons from the existing register of permanent residents to the register of aliens ex proprio motu without any decision or notification being addressed to the persons concerned there was no statutory basis whatsoever for them to take such action the inhabitants evidence of residence and population registry act which is invoked by the government in its explanations does not contain any provisions on the removal of permanent residents from the register on the basis of the act itself neither is the government empowered by statute to adopt individual decisions determining the manner in which statutory provisions are to be implemented on the basis of article of the constitution duties and functions associated with public administration are to be conducted independently and at all times pursuant to and in a manner consistent with the constitution and the law when the government found that the aliens act could not also be applied in practice to citizens of other republics it should have proposed that the legislature regulate their legal position and should not have interfered with the legislative power by adopting a decision for the foregoing reasons the aliens act whose transitional provisions do not regulate the legal status of citizens of other republics who had permanent residence in the and were actually resident in its territory has violated the principles of a law-governed state under article of the constitution for this reason the citizens of other republics upon the expiry of the time-limits set in subsection of section found themselves in an insecure legal position from the text of the transitional provisions which specify that the provisions of the aliens act are to be applied the said persons could not have grasped what their position would be as foreigners and which statutory provisions should apply to them accordingly the concludes that because the legal position of citizens of other republics as foreigners has not been regulated in the the principle of legal certainty as one of the principles of a law-governed state has been violated the principle of legal certainty guarantees to the individual that the state will not make his or her legal position worse without justified reasons it was quite justified that citizens of other republics who did not opt for slovenian citizenship should not expect that they would be made equal to foreigners who had only just come into the and that they would be deprived of permanent residence without moreover being given any notice whatsoever the relevant parts of the constitutional court s decision of april see paragraphs above read as follows at a session held on april in the proceedings to examine petitions and in the proceedings to review constitutionality commenced upon petitions by the association of the erased of slovenia ptuj and others represented by m.k and n.m.p the constitutional court decided as follows the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in the official gazette rs nos and is inconsistent with the constitution as it does not recognise citizens of other republics of the former sfry who were removed from the register of permanent residents on february as having permanent residence from the aforementioned date the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in the republic of slovenia is inconsistent with the constitution as it does not regulate the acquisition of a permit for permanent residence by citizens of other republics of the former sfry as referred to in the previous paragraph whose forcible removal as a foreigner was ordered under section of the aliens act official gazette rs no and section of the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in the is inconsistent with the constitution for the reasons mentioned in the reasoning of this decision subsections and of section of the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in the are abrogated in the parts in which they determine a time-limit of three months for submitting an application for the issuance of a permit for permanent residence the legislature is obliged to remedy the unconstitutionalities established in paragraphs and of the operative provisions within six months from the date of the publication of this decision in the official gazette of the the permanent residence status of citizens of other republics of the former sfry is hereby established from february onwards if they were removed on that day from the register of permanent residents by means of a permit for permanent residence issued on the basis of the act on regularisation of the legal status of citizens of other successor states to the former sfry in the republic of slovenia the aliens act official gazette rs nos and or the aliens act official gazette rs no the ministry of the interior must as an official duty issue supplementary decisions on the establishment of their permanent residence in the from february onwards r e a s o n s as the challenged act does not enable citizens of other republics to acquire permanent resident status from the day when it was not formally recognised in their case that is when such status was taken away and thus only partially remedies the established unconstitutionality it is inconsistent with the constitution the principle of legal certainty as one of the principles of a state governed by the rule of law under article of the constitution requires that the position of the persons concerned should not remain unregulated for any period of time permanent resident status is an important linking aspect for claiming certain rights and legal benefits which the persons concerned could not claim owing to the legally unregulated state of affairs their position in the republic of slovenia was legally uncertain owing to the unregulated state of affairs as by acquiring the status of foreigner they lost their permanent resident status in the territory of the republic of slovenia and found themselves in an unregulated position or in an essentially worsened legal position for example that of having temporary resident status which has lasted in the case of some of the adversely affected persons for as much as ten years from the recommendation that the national assembly made in the light of the annual report of the human rights ombudsman for the year official gazette rs no it follows that the issue of the legal position of such citizens of other republics still calls for legal regulation on account of the fact that their permanent resident status was not recognised from the day when their legal status was following the gaining of independence by the republic of slovenia changed to the different status of a foreigner citizens of other republics were not able to assert certain rights that they would have otherwise been entitled to as foreigners permanently residing in the republic of slovenia the petitioners did not explicitly define these rights however from the decisions of the it follows that these concerned in particular the right to the advance payment of a military pension the right to social-security benefits and the ability to change one s driving licence the arbitration commission of the conference on yugoslavia commonly known as the badinter arbitration commission chaired by mr

court at the final deliberations andré potocki substitute judge replaced julia laffranque who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case rule the applicants and the government each filed further written observations rule on the merits in addition third-party comments were received from equal rights trust a non-governmental organisation based in london the united kingdom which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule a hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on april rule there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by ms maralyan ms yermolayeva ms davidyan and mr matyushkin and their answers to questions put by the court the applicants mr khamtokhu and mr aksenchik were born in and respectively they are currently serving life sentences in the yamalo-nenetskiy region of russia on december the supreme court of the adygea republic found the first applicant guilty of multiple offences including escape from prison attempted murder of police officers and state officials and illegal possession of firearms and sentenced him to life imprisonment on october the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the first applicant s conviction on appeal on march the presidium of the supreme court of the russian federation quashed the appeal judgment of october by way of supervisory review and remitted the matter for fresh consideration on june the supreme court of the russian federation upheld the first applicant s conviction on appeal the court reclassified some of the charges against him but the life sentence remained unchanged on april the tomsk regional court found the second applicant guilty on three counts of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment on august the supreme court of the russian federation upheld that conviction on appeal the criminal code of the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr provided that capital punishment could not be imposed on anyone below the age of or on a woman who was pregnant either at the time of the offence or at the time of judgment article the alternative to the death sentence was fifteen years imprisonment there was no provision for life imprisonment on april the rsfsr criminal code was updated and the exemption from capital punishment in article was extended to all women and to young offenders and offenders aged or over the criminal code of the russian federation which has replaced the rsfsr criminal code since january adopted a more detailed inventory of penalties it provides for up to twenty years imprisonment article life imprisonment article and capital punishment article women young offenders below the age of and offenders aged or over are exempted in identical terms from both life imprisonment and capital punishment articles and by way of a pardon capital punishment can be commuted to life imprisonment or twenty-five years imprisonment article in the constitutional court imposed an indefinite moratorium on capital punishment in russia for the text of the decision see a.l x.w v. russia no october article life imprisonment reads as follows life imprisonment may be imposed for particularly serious offences against life and public safety life imprisonment may not be imposed on women persons who were under eighteen years of age at the time they committed the offence or men who were sixty-five or older at the time the conviction was pronounced. a court may pronounce the offender sentenced to life imprisonment eligible for early release after the first twenty-five years provided that he has fully abided by the prison regulations throughout the previous three years article the constitutional court has consistently declared inadmissible complaints about the alleged incompatibility of article of the criminal code with the constitutional protection against discrimination the most recent reiteration of its settled position can be found in its judgment of february and reads as follows a ban on imposing life sentences or capital punishment on certain categories of offenders can not be seen as a breach of the principle of equality before the law and the courts article of the constitution or a breach of russia s international legal commitments it is justified by the need to take into account the age and social and physiological characteristics of such individuals on the basis of the principles of justice and humanity in the criminal law with a view to attaining in a more comprehensive and efficient way the objectives of criminal punishment in a democratic state based on the rule of law according to the case-law of the constitutional court the ban does not prevent courts from meting out just punishment to other categories of offenders which corresponds to the gravity of the crime committed the circumstances of its commission and the personality of the offender it does not undermine their rights and accordingly is not discriminatory against them decisions no of october no of june no of october no of october and no of september according to the information available to the court there are currently nine member states of the council of europe where life imprisonment does not exist andorra bosnia-herzegovina croatia montenegro norway portugal san marino serbia and spain in the rest of the world many central and south american countries bolivia colombia costa rica dominican republic ecuador honduras mexico nicaragua panama paraguay el salvador uruguay and venezuela have abolished life imprisonment with some exceptions during wartime a comparative survey of the sentencing guidelines in thirty-seven member states of the council of europe in which offenders may be sentenced to life imprisonment reveals that all of them establish a special sentencing regime for juveniles or young adults whether by way of including special provisions in the criminal code or enacting specific legislation dealing with juvenile delinquents life imprisonment of offenders below the age of years is prohibited in thirty-two member states austria liechtenstein the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and sweden extend the prohibition to young adults up to the age of and hungary includes those who had not yet turned at the time the offence was committed as regards older offenders four member states not including russia establish a specific sentencing regime an offender who has reached retirement age azerbaijan the age of georgia or romania and ukraine can not be sentenced to life imprisonment in romanian law the maximum sentence in such a case may not exceed thirty years imprisonment as regards gender-related distinctions the criminal law of albania azerbaijan and moldova in addition to russia imposes a blanket ban on life imprisonment for women armenian and ukrainian criminal law prohibits courts from imposing life sentences on women who were pregnant at the time of the offence or at the time of sentencing and a similar provision can be found in the bulgarian criminal code which exempts pregnant female offenders from life imprisonment without parole article of the international covenant on civil and political rights provides sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women. article a of the convention on the rights of the child provides states parties shall ensure that a no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age the committee on the rights of the child in general comment no recommended given the likelihood that a life imprisonment of a child will make it very difficult if not impossible to achieve the aims of juvenile justice despite the possibility of release the committee strongly recommends the states parties to abolish all forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons under the age of the united nations general assembly adopted resolution on human rights in the administration of justice on december urging states to ensure that under their legislation and practice neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without the possibility of release is imposed for offences committed by persons under years of age and to consider repealing all other forms of life imprisonment for offences committed by persons under years of age. for the text of article of the international covenant on civil and political rights see paragraph above the united nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw reads in the relevant parts adoption by states parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be

or verbal violence abuse and sexual harassment shall be developed and implemented. pregnant or breastfeeding women prisoners shall receive advice on their health and diet on january the committee of ministers of the council of europe adopted recommendation rec to member states on the european prison rules which replaced recommendation no r on the european prison rules accounting for the developments which had occurred in penal policy sentencing practice and the overall management of prisons in europe the amended european prison rules read in particular as follows these rules shall be applied impartially without discrimination on any ground such as sex race colour language religion political or other opinion national or social origin association with a national minority property birth or other status prisoners shall be allowed to give birth outside prison but where a child is born in prison the authorities shall provide all necessary support and facilities. the european parliament s resolution of march on the particular situation of women in prison recommends that the imprisonment of pregnant women and mothers with young children should only be considered as a last resort and that in this extreme case they should be entitled to a more spacious cell and an individual cell if possible and should be given particular attention especially in terms of diet and hygiene considers furthermore that pregnant women should receive antenatal and postnatal care and parenting classes of a standard equivalent to those provided outside the prison environment,case originated

commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby the united kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and of the convention art art in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of rules of court a the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him rule the chamber to be constituted included ex officio sir john freeland the elected judge of british nationality article of the convention art and mr r. bernhardt the vice-president of the court rule para b on february in the presence of the registrar the president of the court mr r. ryssdal drew by lot the names of the other seven members namely mr thór vilhjálmsson mr f. gölcüklü mr f. matscher mr r. macdonald mr n. valticos mr i. foighel and mr a.b baka article in fine of the convention and rule para art subsequently mr bernhardt and mr macdonald were prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case and were replaced respectively by mr ryssdal as president of the chamber and by mr a. spielmann first substitute judge as president of the chamber at that time rule para mr bernhardt acting through the registrar consulted the agent of the united kingdom government the government the applicant s representative and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the proceedings rules para and pursuant to the order made in consequence the registrar received the applicant s memorial on june and the government s memorial on july following enquiries conducted through the registrar no objection was raised as to making accessible the applicant s submissions in the proceedings before the commission dated june and march these submissions were subsequently appended to the applicant s memorial on june the president of the chamber at the time mr bernhardt granted leave to rights international a non-governmental human rights organisation based in new york to submit written comments rule para these were received on august and forwarded on september to the delegate of the commission the applicant s representative and the agent of the government for comment no comments were received in accordance with a decision of the then president of the chamber the hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on october the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court a for the government b for the commission c for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr ress mr mansfield and mr garnham the applicant who is black is a british citizen born in and currently living in manchester england the applicant was tried for robbery at manchester crown court between and november he was legally represented at the trial on the final day of the trial at a.m. the jury retired to consider their verdict an hour and three quarters later a note was passed by the jury to the judge it read jury showing racial overtones member to be excused in the absence of the jury the trial judge showed the note to counsel for the prosecution and defence and consulted them on the appropriate response to it there is some uncertainty as to the stance taken by defence counsel with regard to the follow-up to be given to the note prosecution counsel recalls that defence counsel did not raise strong objections to the approach which the judge indicated he intended to pursue namely to recall the jury and give clear directions on their duty to return a verdict on the basis of the evidence alone however defence counsel seems to recall that he did in fact ask the trial judge to discharge the jury in the circumstances but his application was refused defence counsel based his recollection on the grounds of appeal and advice on appeal which he drafted shortly after the trial on december however neither of these documents suggests that defence counsel made an express request to the judge to discharge the jury under point of his grounds of appeal defence counsel concluded it is submitted that in the circumstances aforesaid some enquiries should have taken place with a view to acceding to the request of the jury that one of their numbers be discharged in the accompanying advice on appeal defence counsel stated it seems to me that it is at least arguable that the trial judge should have enquired further into the matter with a view to acceding to the request that the jury were making the judge s recollection is that both counsel agreed to his proposed course of action see paragraph above the jury were recalled at p.m. pausing at appropriate junctures to ensure that his statement was being understood the judge redirected the jury in the following terms you are brought here as twelve people from your various walks of life your various backgrounds everybody has preconceived ideas and thoughts but you are brought here from twelve different backgrounds expecting to apply your twelve different minds to the problems that are put before you you decide this case according to the evidence and nothing else in the case any thoughts or prejudice of one form or another for or against anybody must be put out of your minds you decide this case on evidence it is the evidence alone which decides the case do you understand that members of the jury you are the judges and you decide it on the evidence and weighing the individuals as you saw them and allowing no other factor to influence your decision but your decision about the quality of the evidence and the way in which a particular individual you are considering treating them all alike and making no distinction whether a person is a defendant or otherwise where he lives where he comes from do you understand that i am certainly not going to discharge any member of the jury because he or she may wish me to do so because they dislike certain overtones in the conversation decide this case according to the evidence members of the jury i am not saying you should be biased in favour or against it look at the way it was given decide the case that way and no other that is your sworn duty i expect you to abide by your sworn duty the jury then retired at p.m. at p.m. the jury being unable to reach a unanimous verdict were recalled by the judge he informed them that the time had come when he could accept a verdict of at least a majority of ten the jury retired again at p.m. at p.m. the jury were still undecided and they were called back again the judge further directed the jury as follows members of the jury each of you has taken an oath to reach a true verdict according to the evidence remember that is the oath you took two days ago not one of you must be false to that oath you do have a duty not only as individuals but collectively as a jury that of course is the strength of the jury system so each of you when you go into your jury room take with you your individual experience and wisdom your task is to pool that experience and wisdom you must do that by giving your views and listening to the views of other people of necessity there will be discussion there has got to be argument and there has got to be give and take within the scope of the oath that each of you has taken that is the way you achieve agreement at p.m. the jury returned and delivered a ten to two majority verdict finding the applicant guilty the applicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment the applicant sought leave from the court of appeal to appeal against conviction he submitted that in the circumstances the trial judge had wrongly failed to make any enquiry into the note with a view to determining whether one of the members of the jury should be discharged on the grounds of racial prejudice and that this failure gave rise to a material irregularity at the trial see paragraph above leave to appeal was refused by the single judge on february he stated that the learned judge dealt with the novel and delicate situation presented by the jury note with tact and sensitivity it would have been entirely inappropriate for him to have conducted some sort of enquiry there was no material irregularity at your trial the applicant renewed his application to the full court of appeal on january the application was dismissed the court of appeal noted that the trial judge took the view and this court agrees with it that the nature of the jury s anxiety was that one member of the jury felt that there was a general overtone of racial comment which was unacceptable and not as the applicant is suggesting one member of the jury being so racially prejudiced as to be unable to give proper consideration to the matters before him the court continued matters of this kind raise delicate issues the jury system does require an element of give and take after proper directions from the judge in our judgment his honour judge hammond dealt with this matter sensitively sensibly and correctly and can not be faulted for a conclusion that the jury should continue the deliberations which they had given their oath to undertake we therefore find no ground for complaint and we dismiss this application the trial judge is the arbiter of issues of law he must ensure that the trial is properly conducted according to law he is required at the end of a trial inter alia to sum up the evidence to direct the jury to disregard evidence which is inadmissible to remind juries of their duties and functions to explain any law which the jury is required to apply to direct the jury on the onus and burden of proof and to ask the jury to reach a verdict on the evidence they have heard the jury in crown court trials consists of twelve members who have taken an oath or affirmed to faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence the jury is the arbiter of fact jury service is regarded as an important civic duty the juries act as amended governs qualification for jury service ineligibility disqualification excusal discharge and other relevant matters every person between and who satisfies the requirements set out in section of the juries act is qualified to serve on a jury and liable to do so if summoned under section of that act the electoral register serves as the basis of jury selection random selection of potential jurors is regarded as a key safeguard against corruption or bias in a sworn jury there are a number of other guarantees including it is lawful for enquiries to be made as to whether potential jurors are disqualified by reason of previous convictions for this purpose a search may be made of criminal records in order to ascertain whether or not a jury panel includes a disqualified person furthermore in cases involving national security or terrorism additional steps may be taken to test the integrity of a potential juror the attorney-general has laid down guidelines on the conduct of jury checks on the trial of an indictment and before the jurors are sworn the accused and the prosecution may object to the jurors who are called to serve challenges are of two kinds to the array that is to say to the whole number of persons in the panel and to the polls that is to say to individual jurors challenges to the polls must be for cause the juries act specifies the causes for challenge including the presumed or actual partiality of a potential juror any challenge for cause must be decided by the judge before whom the accused is to be tried the challenging party must provide prima facie evidence of good cause for this purpose if the challenge for cause is allowed the juror is ordered to stand down and a fresh juror is called challenges for cause are unlimited the prosecution alone are entitled to require a juror to stand by in which case he returns to the panel from which jurors are selected the attorney-general issued guidelines in november on the exercise of the prosecution s right to ask jurors to stand by the guidelines indicate inter alia that the right should be asserted only on the basis of clearly defined and restrictive criteria in certain types of criminal proceedings it is also the practice for the trial judge to put questions to the panel of jurors before the trial begins in order to pre-empt any risk of partiality this practice is typically used in terrorist cases as well as in cases involving allegations of police misconduct or fraud against companies or government departments the judge s questions are designed to establish whether for example a potential juror is related to or is a close friend of police officers or members of the armed forces or is employed by the company or government department involved in the criminal proceedings section of the juries act states that the verdict of a jury in proceedings in the crown court need not be unanimous if a in a case where there are not less than eleven jurors ten of them agree on the verdict and b in a case where there are ten jurors nine of them agree on the verdict the jury must spend at least two hours in deliberations before a majority verdict can be accepted at any time during their deliberations the jurors may send a note to the trial judge asking for further assistance or clarification on receipt of a jury note the established practice is for the trial judge to show the note to counsel for the prosecution and defence in the absence of the jury and to invite their submissions on a suitable response where a judge receives a note from a jury including one alleging misconduct or bias within the jury the following options are available to the judge a to give the jury a further direction or b to discharge up to three jurors and to allow the trial to continue with the remaining jurors section of the juries act or c to discharge the entire jury and order a retrial before a fresh jury if the judge considers there is a high degree of need for this course of action or d to enquire of the jury as a whole whether they are capable of continuing and returning a verdict where an application to discharge a juror on the ground of misconduct or bias is made it is established in english statute law see paragraph below and common law that enquiries or investigations should not be made into what is said in the jury room after the jury have retired r. v. orgles weekly law reports the rule governing the secrecy of jury deliberations is set out in section of the contempt of court act section states that it is a contempt of court to obtain disclose or solicit any particulars of any statements made opinions expressed arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations in the case of r. v. gough all england law reports the house of lords restated and clarified the law on bias which was applicable at the time of the conviction of the applicant if the possibility of bias on the part of a juror comes to the attention of the trial judge in the course of a trial the trial judge should consider whether there is actual bias or not a subjective test if this has not been established the trial judge must then consider whether there is a real danger of bias affecting the mind of the relevant juror or jurors an objective test in this latter respect lord goff in the gough case stated as follows i think it is unnecessary in formulating the appropriate test to require that the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man because the court in such cases as these personifies the reasonable man and in any event the court has first to ascertain the relevant circumstances from the available evidence knowledge of which would not necessarily be available to an observer in court at the relevant time i would prefer to state the test in terms of real danger rather than real likelihood to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias section of the criminal justice act came into force on october the secretary of state is obliged under section to publish each year such information as he considers necessary for the purpose of inter alia facilitating the performance by persons engaged in the administration of criminal justice of their duty to avoid discriminating against any persons on the ground of race in march the lord chancellor announced the formation of an ethnic minorities advisory committee as a sub-committee of the judicial training board by november this sub-committee had initiated its first seminar on ethnic minority issues for members of the senior judiciary race-awareness training for full and part-time members of the judiciary began in early and is the largest single judicial training exercise ever conducted in the united kingdom in his application of july no to the commission the applicant complained inter alia that he had not been given a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal contrary to article of the convention art and that he had been discriminated against on grounds of his race and/or colour contrary to article art the commission first chamber declared the application admissible as regards these two complaints on april in its report of october article art it expressed the opinion by eight votes to three that there had been no violation of article of the convention art and unanimously that the applicant s complaint under article in conjunction with article art did not give rise to any separate issue the full text of the commission s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment as in their memorial the government requested the court to hold that in this case there had been no violation of article para of the convention art and no violation of article in conjunction with article para art the applicant asked the

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on july within the three-month period laid down by article para and article art art of the convention it originated in an application no against the lodged with the commission under article art by two italian nationals mr giovanni spadea and mrs michelangela scalabrino on april the commission 's request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under article of protocol no and article of the convention taken in conjunction with that article of the protocol art in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of rules of court a the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings the president gave mr spadea leave to present his own case to represent mrs scalabrino and to use the italian language rule para and rule the chamber to be constituted included ex officio mr c. russo the elected judge of italian nationality article of the convention art and mr r. ryssdal the president of the court rule para b on july in the presence of the registrar the president drew by lot the names of the other seven members namely mr f. matscher mr l. e. pettiti mr b. walsh mr s.k martens mr a.n loizou mr l. wildhaber and mr g. mifsud bonnici article in fine of the convention and rule para art as president of the chamber rule para mr ryssdal acting through the registrar consulted the agent of the italian government the government mr spadea and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the proceedings rules para and pursuant to the order made in consequence the registrar received the government 's and the applicants memorials on and january respectively the delegate of the commission did not submit any written observations on march the commission produced the file on the proceedings before it as requested by the registrar on the president 's instructions on this last date mr spadea informed the registry that he would not be attending the hearing in accordance with the president 's decision the hearing took place in public in the human rights building on march the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court a for the government b for the commission the court heard addresses by mr conforti mr raimondi and mr colla mr spadea a lawyer and mrs scalabrino a university teacher live in in april they bought two adjacent flats with the aim of making their home there the former owner of the flats had let them to a mrs b. and a mrs z. who paid a rent subject to public-authority control in a writ served on october the applicants gave the tenants of the flats notice to quit when the leases expired on december and summoned them to appear before the magistrate pretore on december and january the magistrate formally confirmed the notices to quit and fixed the date of eviction at december the orders were made enforceable on december and january pursuant to legislative decree no of february which became law no of april law no the magistrate suspended enforcement of the evictions until january on march mr spadea and mrs scalabrino began proceedings to enforce the orders for possession as the tenants had still not complied with them however on each of three occasions when the bailiff responsible for enforcement went to the flats june september and october mrs b. and mrs z. refused to leave they were elderly ladies of modest means and had asked milan city council to allocate them low-rent flats legislative decree no of october which became law no of december suspended the enforcement of evictions until march from that date until march only the prefect prefetto was empowered in certain cases to grant police assistance to enforce evictions on may june september november december and january the bailiff made unsuccessful attempts to enforce the orders for possession from february enforcement of evictions was again suspended initially until december by legislative decree no of february which became law no of april and then until april by legislative decree no of december which became law no of february in august mrs z. died and the applicants regained possession of one of the flats mrs b. left the other in february in the meantime on february mr spadea and mrs scalabrino had been obliged to buy another flat on the basis of the commission 's report italian legislation on residential property leases may be summarised as follows since the public authorities in have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents this has been achieved by rent freezes occasionally relaxed when the government decreed statutory increases by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement suspension or staggering of evictions the last statutory extension of all current leases with the exception of certain cases specifically prescribed by the law was introduced by law no of july and remained in force until december june or december depending on the dates on which the leases were signed it should however be noted that as regards buildings used for purposes other than housing the statutory extension of current leases prescribed by section bis of law no of april was declared unconstitutional in a decision no handed down by the constitutional court on april in its decision the court held that the statutory restrictions imposed on property rights under article of the constitution with a view to ensuring social justice made it possible to regard controls imposing restrictions as legitimate provided that such controls were of an exceptional and temporary nature but that perpetuating such restrictions was incompatible with the protection of property rights embodied in article of the constitution in its decision the also pointed out that the statutory six-month extension of leases prescribed by law no should not be considered in isolation but within the context of tenancy provisions as a whole the court drew particular attention to the fact that this extension succeeded other statutory extensions and could mark the beginning of new restrictions on freedom of contract in this field moreover the statutory extension of leases had the effect of prolonging contracts in which the rent notwithstanding the increases allowed in accordance with rises in the cost of living were not even approximately in line with current socio-economic conditions further the law concerned did not give the lessor the possibility of regaining possession of the property except in cases of absolute necessity the constitutional court also held that law no inasmuch as it provided for a blanket extension of current leases without taking into consideration the particular economic circumstances of lessors and lessees as would have been necessary to ensure social justice infringed the principle of the equality of citizens before the law embodied in article of the constitution numerous provisions have established rules for the postponement suspension or staggering of the enforcement of judicial decisions ordering tenants to vacate the premises they occupy ordinanze di sfratto a first suspension was introduced by legislative decree no of december the provisions set forth therein were incorporated in legislative decree no of february which became law no of april it covered the period from december to june this legislation also provided for the staggered resumption of forcible evictions on july september november or january depending on the date on which the judgment recording the end of the lease had become enforceable section of law no stipulated that such suspensions were not applicable if repossession of the premises had been ordered because arrears of rent were owed similarly no suspension could be ordered in the following cases a where after conclusion of the contract the lessor required the property for his own use or for that of his spouse or his children or grandchildren for residential commercial or professional purposes or where a lessor who intended to use the premises for one of the above-mentioned purposes a offered the tenant similar accommodation at a rent which he could afford and which was not more than higher than the previous rent and b undertook to pay the costs of the tenant 's removal article first subsection paragraphs and of law no of july law no and b where inter alia a lessor urgently needed to regain possession of his flat as accommodation for himself his children or his ascendants article first paragraph sub-paragraphs and of legislative decree no of december which became law no of february law no a second suspension was introduced by legislative decree no of october which became law no of december it covered the period from october to march and in sections and provided for the same exceptions as the provisions in the preceding legislation law no of december also established that the prefect was competent to determine the criteria for authorising police assistance in evicting recalcitrant tenants after consulting a committee including representatives of both tenants and landlords section bis of law no of december also provided for the automatic suspension until december of forcible evictions of tenants entitled to subsidised housing a third suspension was introduced by legislative decree no of february which became law no of april it first covered the period from february to september and was subsequently extended from the latter date to december a fourth suspension was introduced by legislative decree no of december which became law no of february and covered the period up to april in regions suffering from natural disasters the suspension remained in force until december with the exception of urgent cases this law also provided that police assistance in enforcing evictions would only be authorised in gradual stages over a period of forty-eight months from january and set up a prefectoral committee responsible for deciding which cases required police intervention most urgently all the aforementioned laws and decrees also

as suffering from mental illness since the couple s separation x has opposed any contacts be they direct or via telephone between the applicant and the child he was able to see his daughter on only one occasion on july for half an hour on july the applicant lodged an action for an interim injunction ordonanţă preşedenţială with the baia mare district court he requested that during the divorce proceedings the child be returned to the family home to live with him as she had done since her birth alternatively he requested that the court establish a contact schedule so that he could spend time with the child in his home every tuesday and thursday from p.m. to p.m. and every other week from p.m. on fridays to p.m. on sundays on august x acquiesced to allow the applicant contact with their daughter but only on tuesdays and thursdays in public places and in her presence she further requested that the court set the child s residence with her during the divorce proceedings and order the applicant to contribute to the child s financial needs x explained that she had left the family home with the child because the applicant who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia had been physically and psychologically aggressive towards her sometimes even in their child s presence x claimed that the applicant had also been abusive towards their daughter telling her on several occasions that he did not need her love she also claimed that because of the applicant s illness he had never been left alone with the child either she or the child s maternal grandmother had always been present the district court examined the parents psychiatric records the applicant s most recent internment at his wife s request having been from to april in the psychiatric ward of sighetul marmaţiei municipal hospital the court also heard evidence from the child s grandmothers and x s maternal aunt the maternal aunt declared that having known the applicant since he had married her niece she had the impression that he had always tried to control his wife and to have the last word in any discussion x s mother declared that she had been taking care of y in the applicant s home since x had returned to work at the end of her maternity leave when y had reached the age of two the applicant had forbidden her from having contact with the child alleging that she had been abusing y she further declared that in her opinion the child would not be safe with her father not even for a few days because of his illness the applicant s mother declared that the applicant had been taking care of y since her birth and the relationship between father and child had always been excellent she had not witnessed or heard of any aggressive behaviour in the family in addition the court received a report from the baia mare directorate general for social welfare and child protection the childprotection authority concerning the material conditions offered by each parent for raising the child the child-protection authority conducted interviews with the parents and examined their domestic environments it concluded as follows following the assessment undertaken it is concluded that the parents are separated and the tensions between them make any civilised communication aimed at correctly handling the child s situation impossible the child is healthy and well taken care of by the mother and the maternal grandmother the child is four years old and has developed an attachment with all the adults in her life parents grandparents the applicant considers that he can offer the child better housing conditions and a lot of love and affection and for these reasons he requests that the child s residence be set with him in x s view the father does not offer psycho-emotional safety for the child because he does not admit his illness and does not take his medication the parents have been advised to put the child s best interests above their anger and pride and have been made aware of the importance of offering psycho-emotional comfort to the child in order to allow for a harmonious development of her personality in the light of the above findings the court is requested to make its decision bearing in mind the best interests of the child. on september the court sitting in camera the judge and the court clerk interviewed y according to the interview report drafted by the court y told the judge that she and her mother had moved in with her grandmother because the applicant used to shout at her mother and sometimes at her she liked living at her grandmother s place because nobody shouted at her and everybody behaved nicely the district court gave judgment on september it set weekly contacts between the applicant and y from p.m. to p.m. on tuesdays and thursdays only in public places and in the mother s presence it also set the child s residence with her mother until the end of the divorce proceedings and ordered the applicant to pay maintenance for his daughter the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows the evidence in the file that is the written evidence the witnesses statements and the child-protection authority s report does not indicate any justified reason for prohibiting contact between the applicant and the child however in view of the medical evidence in the file which reveals the applicant s chronic mental illness as well as the witness statements and the child s statement in order to protect the child s interests contacts must be limited and must take place in public in the mother s presence. the applicant lodged an appeal with the maramureş county court complaining mainly that the district court had relied exclusively on his illness in a subjective and partial manner he had never been violent with his daughter and nothing in the file could prove that he represented a threat to her he also denied having ever been violent towards his wife and explained that it had been x who had threatened him repeatedly that she would use his illness in order to get him committed to the psychiatric hospital and to take y away from him he also reiterated his request to have the child returned to their family home with him on september the baia mare psychiatric hospital informed the court that in the past two years the applicant had taken his medication and had not suffered any episode of psychiatric decompensation caused by his illness in a final decision of november the county court dismissed the appeal the relevant parts of the decision read as follows in agreement with the first-instance court the county court notes that the medical evidence in the file together with the remaining evidence witness statements correspondence and the father s attitude towards the mother justify temporarily setting the child s residence with her mother ordering the father to pay maintenance and setting a limited contact schedule in the mother s presence the child-protection authority s reports have revealed that the current relationship between the parents makes any civilised communication impossible a criminal complaint lodged in by x for the offence of threats is currently under examination the child is emotionally attached to both parents in disagreement with the applicant the county court finds that the first-instance court decision was not exclusively based on his diagnosis it took into account all evidence in the file it is to be noted that the father s contact with his daughter was not forbidden it was only limited temporarily because of his current state of health and his attitude towards the child and the mother the conflictual situation generated by the divorce caused the applicant to exhibit unbalanced behaviour which is not centred in the child s need to grow up in an environment free from tensions the fact that the applicant has not suffered any episode of decompensation is not in itself sufficient at this time to change the outcome. in accordance with article of the civil code the cc a child who does not live with one of the parents has the right to personal relations with the absent parent the exercise of that right may only be limited in accordance with the law for strong reasons motive temeinice and with consideration given to the child s best interests article of the cc entitled the principle of the best interests of the child states that in taking any measure concerning a child s rights the authorities must be guided by the principle of the best interests of the child decisions adopted by the authorities in child-related matters must take into account the parents wishes and interests and must be rendered expeditiously under article of the cc the court which decides on the parents divorce also sets the child s residence with one of the parents in the light of the child s best interests article of the cc provides that the parent with whom the child does not live has the right to personal relations with the child the court deciding on the parents divorce will decide on the manner in which that right will be exercised article of the code of civil procedure the ccp as in force at the relevant time provided that during divorce proceedings a court could order temporary measures by means of an interim injunction concerning custody of children alimony child allowance and use of the family home the domestic courts also award contact rights by means of an interim injunction during the divorce proceedings see mutatis mutandis cristian cătălin ungureanu v. romania no and september article regulates as follows the manner in which witnesses who

person s legal capacity. on april the committee issued general comment no on equality and non-discrimination it reiterated among other things that persons with disabilities should be acknowledged as full subjects of rights and as rights holders the relevant provisions read as follows ii equality for and non-discrimination against persons with disabilities in international law equality and non-discrimination are at the heart of the convention and evoked consistently throughout its substantive articles with the repeated use of the wording on an equal basis with others which links all substantive rights of the convention to the non-discrimination principle dignity integrity and equality of the person have been denied to those with actual or perceived impairments discrimination has occurred and continues to occur including in brutal forms such as non-consensual and/or forced systematic sterilizations and medical or hormone-based interventions e.g lobotomy or the ashley treatment forced drugging and forced electroshocks confinement systematic murder labelled euthanasia forced and coerced abortion denied access to health care and mutilation and trafficking in body parts particularly of persons with albinism the human rights model of disability and inclusive equality the human rights model of disability recognizes that disability is a social construct and impairments must not be taken as a legitimate ground for the denial or restriction of human rights it acknowledges that disability is one of several layers of identity hence disability laws and policies must take the diversity of persons with disabilities into account it also recognizes that human rights are interdependent interrelated and indivisible inclusive equality is a new model of equality developed throughout the convention it embraces a substantive model of equality and extends and elaborates on the content of equality in a a fair redistributive dimension to address socioeconomic disadvantages b a recognition dimension to combat stigma stereotyping prejudice and violence and to recognize the dignity of human beings and their intersectionality c a participative dimension to reaffirm the social nature of people as members of social groups and the full recognition of humanity through inclusion in society and d an accommodating dimension to make space for difference as a matter of human dignity the convention is based on inclusive equality general obligations of states parties under the convention relating to nondiscrimination and equality the effective enjoyment of the rights to equality and non-discrimination calls for the adoption of enforcement measures such as e specific rules relating to evidence and proof to ensure that stereotyped attitudes about the capacity of persons with disabilities do not result in victims of discrimination being inhibited in obtaining redress relationship with other specific articles of the convention article on awareness-raising discrimination can not be combated without awareness-raising among all sectors of government and society thus any non-discrimination and equality measure must be accompanied by adequate awareness-raising measures and measures to change or abolish compounded pejorative disability stereotypes and negative attitudes in addition violence harmful practices and prejudices must be tackled by awareness-raising campaigns states parties should undertake measures to encourage inter alia the media to portray persons with disabilities in a manner consistent with the purpose of the convention and to modify harmful views of persons with disabilities such as those that portray them unrealistically as being dangerous to themselves and others or sufferers and dependent objects of care without autonomy who are unproductive economic and social burdens to society article on respect for home and the family persons with disabilities often face discrimination in the exercise of their right to marry or their parental and family rights owing to discriminatory laws and policies and administrative measures parents with disabilities are frequently seen as inadequate or unable to take care of their children separation of a child from his or her parents based on the disability of the child or parents or both is discrimination and in violation of article the standard rules on the equalization of opportunities for persons with disabilities were adopted by the un general assembly on march the relevant parts read as follows equalization of opportunities the term equalization of opportunities means the process through which the various systems of society and the environment such as services activities information and documentation are made available to all particularly to persons with disabilities the principle of equal rights implies that the needs of each and every individual are of equal importance that those needs must be made the basis for the planning of societies and that all resources must be employed in such a way as to ensure that every individual has equal opportunity for participation rule family life and personal integrity states should promote the full participation of persons with disabilities in family life they should promote their right to personal integrity and ensure that laws do not discriminate against persons with disabilities with respect to sexual relationships marriage and parenthood persons with disabilities should be enabled to live with their families states should encourage the inclusion in family counselling of appropriate modules regarding disability and its effects on family life respitecare and attendantcare services should be made available to families which include a person with disabilities states should remove all unnecessary obstacles to persons who want to foster or adopt a child or adult with disabilities persons with disabilities must not be denied the opportunity to experience their sexuality have sexual relationships and experience parenthood taking into account that persons with disabilities may experience difficulties in getting married and setting up a family states should encourage the availability of appropriate counselling persons with disabilities must have the same access as others to familyplanning methods as well as to information in accessible form on the sexual functioning of their bodies states should promote measures to change negative attitudes towards marriage sexuality and parenthood of persons with disabilities especially of girls and women with disabilities which still prevail in society the media should be encouraged to play an important role in removing such negative attitudes in the world health organisation adopted guidelines for the promotion of human rights of persons with mental disorders the relevant parts read as follows there shall be no discrimination on the grounds of mental illness ‘ discrimination means any distinction exclusion or preference that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equal enjoyment of rights special measures solely to protect the rights or secure the advancement of persons with mental illness

with the kaliningrad justice department on october the applicants employer the private company kaliningrad commercial seaport co. ltd. зао « морской торговый порт калининград » the seaport company was established on june as a result of the reorganisation of the limited company commercial seaport of kaliningrad and was the legal successor to the latter on july the administrative authority of the baltiyskiy district of kaliningrad officially registered the new legal entity on april the private company was converted into a public company under the same name оао « мптк » the applicants indicated that on march the governor of the kaliningrad region had issued resolution no establishing the kaliningrad regional development fund the fund and appointing five officials of the kaliningrad regional administrative authority to its board of management the governor himself became the chairman of the board and mr karetniy the first deputy governor was appointed fund manager according to the applicants between and mr karetniy was a member of the board of directors of the seaport company during that time mr karetniy also managed through a company called regionk which was controlled by him a further of the seaport company shares thus the applicants inferred that their employer had at the material time been under the effective control of the state both directly of shares owned by the fund and indirectly of the shares managed by an official of the regional administrative authority according to the documents submitted by the government seaport had been in private ownership and the fund had acquired only of its shares in may and in may therefore it could not be said that the state had effective control over its activity moreover the seaport company 's shares held by the fund had been transferred on november to the joint-stock company zemland eskima зао « земланд эскима » with regard to mr karetniy the government submitted that he had been a member of the board of directors of the seaport company however at that time he had not been a civil servant the applicants allegation that he controlled regionk was not supported by any evidence they further alleged that the extent of effective state control had been limited to monitoring the company 's compliance with the applicable laws in may the dur took part in collective bargaining a new collective labour agreement was signed which provided for longer annual leave and better pay conditions as a result over a period of two years dur membership grew from eleven to on october the applicants stated that seaport employed over dockers at the material time on october the dur began a two-week strike over pay better working conditions and health and life insurance the strike failed to achieve its goals and was discontinued on october the applicants submitted that since october the management of seaport had been harassing dur members to penalise them for the strike and incite them to relinquish their union membership on october the managing director of seaport issued an order whereby two special work teams nos and referred to as dockers reserve teams with a staff capacity of up to forty workers each were formed these teams had originally been created for older or health-impaired dockers who could not perform at full capacity they had had insufficient numbers of workers six persons compared with fourteen to sixteen persons in other work teams to handle cargo and after their merger into one team no they had been assigned to work in day shifts lasting eight hours while other teams worked alternating day and night shifts of eleven hours under the terms of the order of october older and health-impaired dockers were transferred to a newly formed team no and the majority of dockers who had taken part in the strike were assigned to the re-formed reserve teams nos and according to the applicants their earning time was substantially reduced as a result of their transfer to reserve teams assigned to work day shifts only in late november the managing director attempted to encourage their co-workers to relinquish their dur membership by immediately transferring those who left the union into nondur teams which had access to actual cargo-handling work on december the new composition of the teams was made official and the managing director ordered the teams to be re-numbered the applicants were transferred to four teams which comprised only dur members who had taken part in the strike teams nos and teams nos and had a work schedule similar to other teams while teams nos and formerly nos and were assigned to work elevenhour day shifts on two consecutive days followed by two days off according to the applicants until december it had been established practice for the leaders of the teams on duty to take turns to choose the work for their team after december the managing director unofficially excluded the leaders of the dur teams from the traditional arrangement effectively confining their options to the least lucrative work the applicants income fell by half to three quarters because they did not receive any cargo-handling work paid at piece rates but performed only auxiliary work paid by the hour at half the normal rate on january the state labour inspector ordered the human resources director of the applicants employer to compensate dockers in the reorganised teams for lost earnings on february the human resources director replied that the reorganisation of teams was an internal matter for the seaport and that given that all dockers received equal pay for equal work there was no legal basis for granting compensation the applicants further alleged that their employer had deliberately kept the dur teams understaffed in august there had been three persons in teams nos and and six persons in teams nos and so as to have an excuse not to give them access to cargo-handling work the first and second applicants complained to the state labour inspectorate about the reassignment of dur members to the special teams on august the head of the state labour inspectorate for the kaliningrad region issued an instruction предписание to the acting managing director of the seaport company the inspectorate found in particular that dockers were being assigned to teams on the basis of their trade union membership such an arrangement was in breach of section of the trade union act and prevented several teams from performing at full capacity as they were understaffed the inspectorate ordered that all the changes to the composition of work teams be reversed in order to restore their staff numbers to normal levels on november the managing director ordered the reassignment of dockers from the four dur teams each of which had fewer than five workers at the time to other teams

only were dur members according to the government only dockers who failed the test had had dur membership dockers who failed the test were suspended from cargohandling work for one week at the second attempt on june twenty workers again failed the test seventeen of them dur members the applicants submitted that a week after the test two non-dur members had been permitted to work while the dur members had been laid off and not given an opportunity to retake the test the applicants submitted that the seaport management had rewarded those who agreed to relinquish their union membership with a pass mark in the test and permission to return to work one applicant had had to hand in his dismissal and find employment outside the seaport on august the state work safety inspector ordered the annulment of the results of the safety regulations test on the ground that the composition of the test committee had not been agreed with the dur the inspector ordered that the test be organised again within one month with the participation of the dur and that the dockers be provided with reference materials on the safety regulations on october the test was held for the third time in the presence of a dur representative and an official of the state work safety inspectorate out of five dur members who sat the test four received the highest mark and the fifth person received the second-highest mark on march the seaport management issued a notice to the effect that dockers would be made redundant on august thirty-three dockers formerly staff members were transferred to as-needed contracts the applicants pointed out that twenty-seven of the transferred dockers had been dur members while at the material time the average rate of dur membership in the seaport was the applicants alleged that the transferred dockers were on average better qualified than their co-workers who had been retained on november the managing director ordered that fortyseven dockers be made redundant on november the human resources director served notice on thirty-five dockers of whom twentyeight were dur members according to the applicants the applicants submitted that the actual dismissal did not take place because it required the consent of their trade union which would never have been granted and had not been sought instead on december fifteen dockers from the dur team were informed that as of february their working time would be reduced from hours to hours a month having examined a complaint lodged by the applicants the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor found that the arbitrary establishment of a part-time schedule for an extremely small number of workers out of dockers with the same qualifications and port dockers in total without their consent was in breach of the constitutional principle of equality and contrary to article of the labour code on february the prosecutor ordered that the seaport company 's managing director remedy the violations the first to sixth ninth tenth eleventh and eighteenth applicants also brought court proceedings they requested that the court declare their transfer unlawful find that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their trade union membership and award them compensation for lost earnings and non-pecuniary damage on january the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad allowed the applicants claims in part the court found that the transfer of a small number of dockers to a part-time schedule had had no valid reason and was therefore unlawful the court ordered the seaport company to compensate the claimants for lost earnings and non-pecuniary damage however the court declined to find that the claimants had been discriminated against on the ground of their dur membership as they had not proved discriminatory intent on the part of the seaport company management on january the dur complained to the international transport workers federation the itf the itf called on the seaport company management to stop discriminating against the dur and threatened an international boycott of cargo originating in seaport following international trade union pressure orchestrated by the itf the seaport company management and the dur signed an agreement on march the dur-only teams were disbanded dur members were transferred to other teams with full access to cargo-handling work and a uniform system of bonuses was put in place the applicants submitted that the conditions of the agreement had been complied with until august when the most active members of the dur were transferred again to a dur-only team in the dur requested the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor 's office to open a criminal investigation into the activities of mr kalinichenko the managing director of the seaport company and to charge him under article of the criminal code with infringement of equality of rights in respect of the applicants on september the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor 's office declined to open a criminal investigation concerning mr kalinichenko as a preliminary inquiry had failed to establish direct intent on his part to discriminate against the applicants a further request by the applicants to have criminal proceedings instituted against the seaport company management for alleged discrimination lodged on november was rejected on december for lack of corpus delicti as the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor 's office had not established direct intent to discriminate against the applicants according to the government the applicants did not appeal against this decision on december the dur filed an action on behalf of its members including six applicants mr sinyakov mr kasyanov mr korchazhkin mr zharkikh mr kalchevskiy and mr dolgalev with the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad the dur requested the court to find that the seaport management 's policies had been discriminatory and to order compensation for lost earnings and nonpecuniary damage sustained by the claimants on august the dur joined further claimants to the action twelve applicants mr danilenkov mr soshnikov mr morozov mr troynikov mr kiselev mr bychkov mr pushkarev mr silvanovich mr oksenchuk mr grabchuk mr tsarev and mr milinets and also submitted new facts corroborating their discrimination complaint on april the dur lodged the action on behalf of its members in its final form on may the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad dismissed the dur 's action the court found the complaints unsubstantiated and held that the seaport management could not be held responsible for the uneven distribution of well-paid cargo-handling work the claimants appealed against the judgment on october the quashed the judgment of may on appeal and remitted the case for fresh examination the court pointed out that the first-instance court had failed to assess whether the transfer of dockers between teams could have been motivated by retaliation against the claimants for their participation in the strike and membership of the dur the court also found that the firstinstance court had ignored the claimants complaint about a decrease in their wages after the transfer compared with their co-workers earnings the court reprimanded the first-instance court for the failure to obtain documents on dockers wages from the defendant and for refusing the claimants request to this effect the court concluded that the first-instance court 's finding as to the absence of discrimination had not been lawful or justified because the above-mentioned shortcomings had prevented it from assessing the claimants arguments in the light of all the relevant information on march the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad delivered a new judgment the court held that the discrimination complaint was unsubstantiated because the applicants had failed to prove the management 's intent to discriminate against them the court based its conclusion on statements from port managers and stevedores the managers explained that dur-only teams had been formed to mitigate tension in the workforce created by the animosity of strikers towards their co-workers who had not taken part in the strike the stevedores denied that they had received any instructions from the management concerning the distribution of cargohandling work the court also referred to the decision of the prosecutor 's office of september and ruled that the seaport company could not be held liable for the alleged acts of discrimination since no intent to discriminate had been established on the part of its management the court pointed to the insignificant number of claimants compared with the total number of strikers and held as follows the very request for a finding of discrimination on the general ground of membership of a certain public association made by only a small group of its members is an indication of the absence of the alleged discrimination while the situation of the claimants is the result of their individual actions and characteristics and of objective factors. the court attributed the decrease in the claimants wages to their individual omissions such as the failure to pass the work safety test and the overall reduction in cargo-handling work in the seaport however on a proposal from the defendant the court awarded the claimants nominal compensation in the form of the difference in wages for two months following their transfer to new teams the applicants appealed against the judgment on august the ordered the discontinuance of the civil proceedings in the part concerning the discrimination complaint the court decided that the existence of discrimination could only be established in the framework of criminal proceedings concerning a specific official or another person legal entities such as the seaport company could not be held criminally liable therefore the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the discrimination complaint against the seaport company in the remainder the court upheld the judgment of march on july all the applicants brought a fresh action against the seaport company they sought a declaration that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their dur membership and that their rights to equal pay for equal work and access to work had been violated they also requested that the violations be made good by the seaport company and that they be awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage on october the justice of the peace of the first court circuit of the baltiyskiy district of kaliningrad in an interim decision определение dismissed the application for a declaration the court followed the reasoning of the judgment of august it held that it lacked jurisdiction to establish whether there had been discrimination because such a fact could only be established in criminal proceedings however a legal entity could not be held criminally liable the applicants appealed against the decision to the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad which on december upheld the decision of october the dur complained to the kaliningrad regional duma alleging a violation by the employer of the rights of its members on november the duma 's standing committee on social policy and health care issued a resolution expressing concern at the situation described by the complainants in particular it stated as follows in the seaport company different labour conditions apply to workers depending on their trade union membership as a result members of the dur are placed at a disadvantage by their employer compared with those who do not belong to the above-mentioned trade union the dur reasonably raised an issue of discrimination at the seaport company in connection with trade union membership on november the duma committee addressed a letter to the prosecutor with a request to take immediate measures to defend the rights of dur members and to consider the possibility of instituting criminal proceedings against the management of the seaport company other domestic proceedings concerning various complaints from to november the second third fourth ninth and eighteenth applicants and four of their co-workers took part in a trade union conference in they had applied in advance to the seaport company management for permission to attend the conference but received no reply by orders of december and march the conference participants had their annual bonuses withdrawn because they had allegedly taken absence without leave the dockers appealed to a court on november the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad found that the seaport company management had been required to grant the claimants leave to attend a trade union conference as their right to such leave was unconditionally guaranteed by section of the trade union act the court declared the orders depriving the claimants of their annual bonuses to be unlawful and ordered the seaport company to pay compensation the judgment was not appealed against on january the eighteenth applicant was issued with a disciplinary reprimand for his failure to appear for work on december which was a public holiday the eighteenth applicant appealed against the sanction he stated that he was an elected leader of a trade union and that therefore the trade union 's consent was required in order to impose the sanction on january the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad allowed the eighteenth applicant 's complaint the court annulled the disciplinary sanction on the ground that the seaport company management had failed to seek the trade union 's consent before imposing it as required by article of the labour code on january dockers of dur-only team no were ordered to clear the port of snow the dockers refused because the collective bargaining agreement provided that they could be required to perform unskilled work only if such work was auxiliary to their cargo-handling work which was not the case they remained on standby in the port until the end of the shift on january the seaport company management ordered that the day in question be counted as absence without leave imposed a disciplinary reprimand and withheld their january bonus the dur lodged a court action on behalf of the second to sixth applicants and the ninth applicant it claimed that the disciplinary sanction should be lifted and the wages and bonuses withheld should be paid on october the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad found in favour of the claimants the court found that the unjustified redeployment of qualified dockers to unskilled work violated their labour rights and that they could not be penalised for an unauthorised absence as they had stood by waiting for cargo-handling work within the port confines in addition the court pointed out that the claimants were elected leaders of a trade union and that the union 's consent was required in order to impose a sanction no such consent had been obtained the seaport company was ordered to lift the sanction and to pay the claimants compensation for lost earnings and bonuses as well as to bear the court fees on may the sixteenth applicant was dismissed on the ground that he had allegedly appeared for work in an inebriated state the sixteenth applicant appealed to a court against the decision to dismiss him on august the ruling at final instance upheld the applicant 's complaint and ordered the seaport company to reinstate him and pay compensation for lost earnings the court found in particular that there was no evidence showing that the sixteenth applicant had been drunk by an order of december the nineteenth twentieth twentysixth and thirty-second applicants were severely reprimanded in the course of disciplinary proceedings against them for allegedly leaving their workplace early without authorisation the dur acting on behalf of the applicants concerned appealed against the disciplinary sanction to a court on november the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad allowed the dur 's action the court found it established that the defendant the seaport company had failed to prove unauthorised absence the court quashed the contested order and awarded the applicants concerned compensation for non-pecuniary damage on june the eighteenth applicant was injured in the workplace a special commission found that he had been responsible for the accident himself as he had allegedly failed to observe the safety regulations a dur representative the twenty-fourth applicant disagreed with the commission 's conclusion nevertheless the eighteenth applicant was reprimanded in disciplinary proceedings and he and his team leader the third applicant lost their june bonus on behalf of the eighteenth and third applicants the dur appealed against these decisions to a court on april the justice of the peace of the first court circuit of the baltiyskiy district of kaliningrad found that the conclusions of the special commission were not sustainable in the light of the testimony given by eyewitnesses the court quashed the disciplinary sanction imposed on the eighteenth applicant and ordered the seaport company to pay the june bonus to him and to his team leader by an order of july the third applicant was demoted from the position of team leader to that of a simple docker on the ground that he had allegedly failed in his leadership duties the dur challenged the order lodging a court action on behalf of the third applicant on may the justice of the peace of the first court circuit of the baltiyskiy district of kaliningrad allowed the action in part the court found that the demotion had not been agreed to by the dur of which the third applicant was an elected leader the court quashed the demotion order and ordered the seaport company to pay compensation for lost earnings and nonpecuniary damage and the court fees on may the seaport company 's human resources director ordered that dur representatives be admitted to the port only in order to visit dur members at their workplaces and during their working hours under the order the second applicant was not allowed into the port on june the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor found that the order violated the guarantees of free access for trade union leaders to the workplaces of union members contained in article of the labour code and section of the trade union act and ordered the managing director of the seaport company to remedy the violation on july the seaport company 's managing director issued a new order no regulating access for dur leaders to the port it provided inter alia that access was only possible between a.m. and p.m. on the basis of one-off permits obtained in advance and specifying the itinerary and purpose of the visit on november the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor requested the seaport company 's managing director to annul order no on the ground that it was unlawful the request was refused by the seaport company management on january the baltiyskiy transport prosecutor lodged a civil action on behalf of the second applicant against the seaport company requesting that order no be declared invalid on july the justice of the peace of the first court circuit of the baltiyskiy district of kaliningrad allowed the action and declared that the order restricting trade union leaders access to the port was unlawful and that in so far as it required advance permission to be obtained it was also in breach of article of the labour code the judgment was not appealed against in august-september the seaport company management founded a subsidiary stevedoring company tpk ооо « транспортнопогрузочная компания » which hired thirty new dockers between september and november tpk 's dockers worked together with the seaport company dockers in mixed teams on november a new collective labour agreement was signed between the kaliningrad seaport company management and the maritime transport workers union the agreement provided inter alia that all cargo-handling work would be assigned to tpk and that the employees of this company would receive a pay rise complementary medical insurance and a special allowance for sport activities in december and january the seaport company management offered most dockers lucrative transfers to tpk but all the dur members were allegedly excluded from the transfer in january the remaining dur members were put into two work teams the seaport company 's managing director announced to the applicants that all stevedoring work would be assigned to tpk as the seaport company 's licence for stevedoring expired on october in april dur members found their potential earning time cut in half after they were forbidden to work night shifts their income fell to around usd per month as against an average for non-dur workers of usd per month in june dur members wages fell again to usd per month as a result of the conflict dur membership shrank from in to only twenty-four on december in february the remaining dur members twenty-two dockers were made redundant and dismissed the second applicant was retained he was a deputy chairman of the dur steering committee and the dur 's consent was required for his dismissal the applicants submitted that he had been kept in his position for the sake of appearances only as he did not have any earning opportunities on march the dur on behalf of the first to fifth ninth to eleventh sixteenth and eighteenth to thirty-second applicants brought a civil action against the seaport company and tpk seeking reinstatement of the dur members and compensation for lost earnings and non-pecuniary damage it also asked the court to find a violation of the applicants right to freedom of association and to declare that the employer 's actions had discriminated against the claimants on the ground of their dur membership on may the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad delivered its judgment the court found that in november the board of directors of the seaport company had decided to reassign the cargo-handling work to tpk between november and april dockers had been transferred to tpk and in december the cargohandling terminals and equipment had been either sold or leased to the new company the court inferred from this that the employer 's real intention had been to change the structural subordination of the stevedoring unit and that there had been no lawful grounds for making the unit 's employees redundant it found the applicants dismissal to be unlawful and ordered their reinstatement with tpk and payment of lost earnings and compensation for non-pecuniary damage the court also examined the applicants allegations of discrimination against them relying on statements by several leaders of dockers teams it established that in november all the dockers had been invited to a meeting where their transfer to tpk had been discussed the applicants had not been prevented from attending and they had been offered the opportunity to apply for transfer however they had refused to do anything without the steering committee chairman 's advice when asked by the court why they had not applied for transfer individually the applicants stated that they had been certain they would receive a negative response from their employer the team leaders also testified that the second applicant the deputy chairman of the steering committee had been present at the meeting and had argued against the transfer to tpk the court further inspected leaflets distributed by the dur and the twenty-fourth applicant 's complaint to a prosecutor 's office it appeared from the leaflets that the dur had consistently campaigned against the transfer to tpk and advocated staying with the seaport company and that the complaint had exposed alleged compulsion to apply for a transfer to tpk the court found that the evidence gathered contradicted the applicants allegations that the dur had not been informed of the transfer or had been excluded from it it dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicants complaints of discrimination against them and of a violation of their right to freedom of association finally the court ordered immediate enforcement of the judgment in the part concerning the applicants reinstatement on august the upheld the judgment of may on an appeal by the seaport company on may the managing director of the seaport company annulled the orders for the applicants dismissal of february and reinstated them however they were not transferred to tpk on june the tpk limited company was reorganised to form the public company оао « морской торговый порт » mtp on september the clarified that the applicants were to be reinstated into mtp which was the legal successor to tpk on august all the applicants were again dismissed from the seaport company for absence without valid reasons however they pointed out that as far back as june the seaport company 's managing director had confirmed to them in writing that there were no earning opportunities for them in the old company because the stevedoring licence had expired in the applicants appealed against their dismissal to a court on october the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad granted the applicants claim the court found that the defendant had failed to enforce the judgment of may in the part concerning the dockers transfer to tpk and that their dismissal for unauthorised absence had therefore been unlawful it ordered payment of lost earnings and compensation for non-pecuniary damage on january the upheld the judgment on appeal on october the applicants employment with the seaport company was terminated in connection with their transfer to another company on the following day the managing director of mtp ordered the hiring of the applicants as second-category stevedores the applicants submitted that the positions offered were below their professional qualification as dockers on december at the applicants request a judge of the baltiyskiy district court of kaliningrad clarified the judgment of may to the effect that the applicants were to be hired by mtp as dockers on february this clarification was confirmed by the article of the russian constitution provides that the state shall guarantee equality of rights and freedoms to all citizens regardless of sex race nationality language origin property and official status place of residence religion beliefs membership of public associations and other circumstances article guarantees the right of association

trade union and include effective punishments and remedies where this right is not respected trade union members must be protected from any harmful consequence that their trade union membership or activities may have on their employment particularly any form of reprisal or discrimination in the areas of recruitment dismissal or promotion because they belong to a trade union or engage in trade union activities where such discrimination occurs domestic law must make provision for compensation that is adequate and proportionate to the harm suffered by the victim see for example conclusions p. it has further held that in order to make the prohibition of discrimination effective domestic law must provide for appropriate and effective remedies in the event of an allegation of discrimination remedies available to victims of discrimination must be adequate proportionate and dissuasive see for example conclusions p. domestic law should provide for an alleviation of the burden of proof in favour of the plaintiff in discrimination cases see conclusions p. article of convention no of the international labour organisation ilo on freedom of association and protection of the right to organise ratified by the provides as follows each member of the international labour organisation for which this convention is in force undertakes to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers and employers may exercise freely the right to organise. article of ilo convention no concerning the application of the principles of the right to organise and to bargain collectively ratified by the reads as follows workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such protection shall apply more particularly in respect of acts calculated to a make the employment of a worker subject to the condition that he shall not join a union or shall relinquish trade union membership b cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership or because of participation in union activities outside working hours or with the consent of the employer within working hours. the digest of decisions and principles of the freedom of association committee of the governing body of the ilo includes the following principles anti-union discrimination is one of the most serious violations of freedom of association as it may jeopardize the very existence of trade unions the basic regulations that exist in the national legislation prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination are inadequate when they are not accompanied by procedures to ensure that effective protection against such acts is guaranteed respect for the principles of freedom of association clearly requires that workers who consider that they have been prejudiced because of their trade union activities should have access to means of redress which are expeditious inexpensive and fully impartial where cases of alleged anti-union discrimination are involved the competent authorities dealing with labour issues should begin an inquiry immediately and take suitable measures to remedy any effects of anti-union discrimination brought to their attention on april the ilo committee on freedom of association forwarded to the committee of experts case no concerning the complaint against the government of the presented by the russian labour confederation ktr report no the ktr alleged that members of the dur the affiliated organisation of the ktr at seaport were subject to anti-union discrimination the committee found inter alia as follows while noting that the baltic district court judgement found that the allegations of anti-union discrimination had not been proven the committee notes that since the court 's decision to reinstate the dur members at the re-subordinated production section of the tpk due to the nevertheless illegal grounds for their dismissal the kaliningrad seaport administration has persistently refused to fully implement this decision despite repeated clarifications and confirmation from this and higher courts in the light of these circumstances the committee feels bound to query the motivation behind the employer 's acts in particular its persistent refusal to reinstate dockers all of whom happen to be members of the dur despite repeated judicial orders in this respect further noting the duma resolution expressing extreme concern about this situation and adding that the question of anti-union discrimination has been reasonably posed the committee therefore requests the government to establish an independent investigation into the allegations of acts of anti-union discrimination and if it is proven that acts of anti-union discrimination were taken against dur members in particular as concerns the non-transferral to the subordinated production sectors at tpk in accordance with the court 's decision to take all necessary steps to remedy this situation to ensure reinstatement at the tpk as requested by the courts as well as payment of lost wages furthermore noting that the dockers were once again dismissed and a new case was filed the committee requests the government to keep it informed of the outcome of this case as concerns the means of redress against alleged acts of anti-union discrimination the committee recalls that the existence of basic legislative provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination is not sufficient if these provisions are not accompanied by effective procedures ensuring their application in practice see digest of decisions and principles of the freedom of association committee edition para noting that in the present case the complainant has been addressing the different judicial bodies since with allegations of anti-union discrimination which were until may rejected on procedural grounds the committee considers that the legislation providing for protection against acts of antiunion discrimination is not sufficiently clear it therefore requests the government to take the necessary measures including the amendment of the legislation in order to ensure that complaints of anti-union discrimination are examined in the framework of national procedures which are clear and prompt,case originated application russian federation lodged court article convention protection human rights

or with a prison term of up to two years under articles and of the criminal code an action causing less severe bodily harm as well as threatening with such harm are offences punishable by periods of imprisonment or community work a summary of the relevant international materials concerning protection from domestic violence including its discriminatory nature against women has been made in the case of opuz v. turkey no echr and eremia v. the republic of moldova no may not yet final in its recommendation rec of april on the protection of women against violence the committee of ministers of the council of europe stated inter alia that member states should introduce develop and/or improve where necessary national policies against violence based on maximum safety and protection of victims support and assistance adjustment of the criminal and civil law raising of public awareness training for professionals confronted with violence against women and prevention the committee of ministers recommended in particular that member states should penalise serious violence against women such as sexual violence and rape abuse of the vulnerability of pregnant defenceless ill disabled or dependent victims as well as penalising abuse of position by the perpetrator the recommendation also stated that member states should ensure that all victims of violence are able to institute proceedings make provisions to ensure that criminal proceedings can be initiated by the public prosecutor encourage prosecutors to regard violence against women as an aggravating or decisive factor in deciding whether or not to prosecute in the public interest ensure where necessary that measures are taken to protect victims effectively against threats and possible acts of revenge and take specific measures to ensure that children s rights are protected during proceedings with regard to violence within the family the committee of ministers recommended that member states should classify all forms of violence within the family as criminal offences and envisage the possibility of taking measures in order inter alia to enable the judiciary to adopt interim measures aimed at protecting victims to ban the perpetrator from contacting communicating with or approaching the victim or residing in or entering defined areas to penalise all breaches of the measures imposed on the perpetrator and to establish a compulsory protocol for operation by the police medical and social services in its general recommendation no on the core obligations of states parties under article of the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women found that states parties have a due diligence obligation to prevent investigate prosecute and punish acts of gender based violence in her report concerning the visit to from to july document may the united nations special rapporteur on violence against women its causes and consequences noted inter alia patriarchal and discriminatory attitudes are increasing women s vulnerability to violence and abuse in this context domestic violence in particular is widespread largely condoned by society and does not receive appropriate recognition among officials society and women themselves thus resulting in insufficient protective infrastructure for victims of violence moldovan women suffer from all forms of violence however domestic violence and trafficking are major areas of concern the two are intimately connected and are linked to women s overall subordinate position in society while reliable data and a systematic registering of cases on the nature and extent of the phenomenon is lacking domestic violence is said to be widespread according to a ministry of labour social protection and family report at present the frequency of domestic violence whose victims are women and children is acquiring alarming proportions unfortunately it is very difficult for the state to control domestic violence since in most of the cases it is reported only when there are severe consequences of the violence the other cases being considered just family conflicts despite this acknowledgement unless it results in serious injury domestic violence is not perceived as a problem warranting legal intervention as a result it is experienced in silence and receives little recognition among officials society and women themselves according to a survey conducted in per cent of women interviewed reported encountering some form of violence within the family at least once during their lifetime the survey revealed that psychological violence followed by physical violence is the most widely reported form of abuse in the family almost a third of the women interviewed indicated having been subjected to multiple forms of violence the study notes that domestic violence runs across lines of class and education however women with a higher level of education or economic status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence sexual violence remains the least reported form of violence this may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts the perpetrators of violence against women are often family members overwhelmingly husbands or former husbands per cent followed by fathers or stepfathers per cent and mothers or stepmothers per cent staff at the shelter in chisinau indicated that husbands of many of the women who seek help at the shelter are either police officers or from the military which makes it far more difficult for these women to escape the violent environment and seek divorce there are also a number of widely held misconceptions about violence against women which treat the problem as isolated cases concerning a particular group these misconceptions are a violence against women is a phenomenon that takes place in poor and broken homes b victims of violence are inherently vulnerable women needing special protection c violent men are deviants who use alcohol and drugs or have personality disorders d domestic violence involves all members of the household including men it has been my experience that such misunderstandings often result in misguided and partial solutions such as rehabilitation programmes for abusers restrictions over women in order to protect them or gender neutral solutions that overlook the causes of gender-based violence,case originated application lodged court article convention

the case originated in an application no against the kingdom of spain lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a spanish national mr antonio aldeguer tomás the applicant on june the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by mr m. ródenas pérez a lawyer practising in madrid the spanish government the government were represented by their agent mr f. sanz gandásegui state attorney the applicant complained under article of the convention taken in conjunction with article that he had been discriminated against on the ground of his sexual orientation in that he had been denied a survivor s pension following the death of his partner with whom he had lived in a de facto marital relationship for twelve years in substance the applicant also relied on article of the convention in conjunction with article of protocol no to the convention on october the application was communicated to the government judge luis lópez guerra the judge elected in respect of spain withdrew from sitting in the case rule of the rules of court on february the president of the section accordingly appointed ms blanca lozano cutanda to sit as an ad hoc judge article of the convention and rule a of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in pozuelo de alarcón madrid the applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from until the latter s death on july during that period they lived together in an apartment belonging to the applicant s partner when his partner died the sister and only heir of the applicant s partner gave the applicant because of the relationship he had had with her brother an apartment that had belonged to the applicant s late partner and in which the couple had spent their holidays together since on september the applicant claimed social security allowances as a surviving spouse under section of the general social security act arguing that he had cohabited with his deceased partner for many years on september the national institute of social security instituto nacional de la seguridad social hereafter referred to as inss refused to grant the applicant a survivor s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section of the general social security act that decision was formally served on june on july law no amending the provisions of the civil code with respect to the right to enter into marriage was passed two days later it entered into force this law legalised same-sex marriage in spain in accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members see paragraph below on july the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of september this complaint was dismissed by the inss on august the inss noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed for the purposes of social security rights the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower on september the applicant challenged that decision before the madrid social tribunal no the social tribunal in a judgment of november the social tribunal ruled for the applicant the social tribunal firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted law no which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal as to the merits the social tribunal observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant as the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship that ended following his partner s death before the entry into force of law no had the right to a survivor s pension the social tribunal then reiterated that according to the well-established domestic case-law surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor s pension under section of the general social security act marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor s pension and that it was evident that after the entry into force of law no surviving spouses of same-sex marriages were entitled to survivors pensions on the same footing as survivors of different-sex marriages the social tribunal was of the view that the solution to the legal issue raised by the applicant s case depended on whether it could be inferred from law no that parliament s intention had been that surviving partners of same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying under the former legislation could access a survivor s pension on a similar footing to same-sex couples who could marry after the entering into force of that act the social tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of law no to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose and that from the date it entered into force that is to say july all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of law no as applying fully to same-sex marriage see paragraph below the social tribunal held in this regard that this is a wide-ranging provision which affects all the other provisions of the legal system making reference to marriage from now onwards all references to marriage established in the law shall be understood as applying also to marriage celebrated between two persons of the same sex accordingly whoever shall be called to interpret or apply any marriage-related provision should do so in egalitarian terms without taking into consideration whether the spouses are of the same or different sex the social tribunal further recalled that additional provision no of law no of july amending the provisions of the civil code pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment judicial separation and divorce recognised the right to obtain a survivor s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before law no entered into force the social tribunal stressed that such a provision was included in order to provide a solution for those cohabiting couples consisting of a man and a woman who could not have married under the legislation in force until that time and thus did not qualify for a survivor s pension because one or even both of them had still been married to another person whom they had been prevented from divorcing divorce having been legally impossible in spain until the passing of law no the social tribunal considered that the applicant s circumstances were fully comparable to those outlined in additional provision no of law no in so far as the claimant could not marry his partner because the legislation then in force prevented him from doing so the claimant had shared a marital life with his partner until the latter s death the latter s death had taken place before the entry into force of law no the social tribunal acknowledged however that whereas law no was aimed at protecting the rights of those cohabiting heterosexual couples who were prevented from marrying because divorce was prohibited at the time law no was aimed at protecting the rights of those who could not marry on account of their sexual orientation and that this distinction was the main impediment to the recognition of the applicant s right to a survivor s pension the social tribunal considered nonetheless that treating these two groups differently would not be in harmony with the strong egalitarian intention expressed by parliament with the passing of law no and that accordingly additional provision no of law no was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no of law no the social tribunal stated as follows therefore the interpretation that in my opinion better fits the legislature s intention is the following if the first additional provision of law no sets out that provisions making reference to marriage shall apply irrespective of the sex of the spouses and one of these provisions currently in force to provide access to a survivor s pension is additional provision no of law no the only method to apply it in a way which is consistent with the egalitarian intention of the legislature is to do so irrespective of the sexual orientation of the members of the cohabiting couple in order to ensure that sexual orientation does not constitute discriminatory grounds in the application of additional provision no of law no the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor s pension is no other than the sexual orientation of the claimant as regards the administration s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor s pension because they were not married the social tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens as is true of the instant case thus additional provision no of law no should be read in the light of the first additional provision of law no as to the degree of retroactivity that should be given to additional provision of law no in the applicant s case the social tribunal relied on the constitutive effects of law no which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force accordingly the social tribunal recognised the applicant s right to be awarded a survivor s pension with effect from july the inss and the treasury general of social security appealed recurso de suplicación against that judgment to the madrid high court of justice tribunal superior de justicia on september the madrid high court of justice upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment the court found that the legislature had not intended law no to cover same-sex partnerships which had been ended by the death of one of the partners before said law had entered into force and that the lack of protection of these unions could not be considered discriminatory in the light of article of the spanish constitution for the court it was only as from the entry into force of law no that marriage between same-sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter hence the court was of the view that law no had no retroactive effects except as otherwise expressly provided which was not the case at hand the court further stated that even though law no had been inspired by the constitutional principle of equality prior legislation preventing same-sex marriage could not be deemed unconstitutional as contrary to either any constitutional principle or to the right not to be discriminated against the court referred to constitutional case-law dating from according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships in this connection the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of law no see paragraph below to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation the aim of parliament in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry but not to protect same-sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment the court referred to constitutional case-law according to which a difference in legal treatment of individuals due to subsequent changes in the law does not necessarily entail discrimination even if those persons could be said to be in similar circumstances given the complexity that a change in legislation might involve it was for parliament to establish the characteristics of the legal transition either by introducing retroactivity clauses or by restricting the application of the new legislation to circumstances arising after its entry into force the court noted in this regard that law no had not included any provision concerning same-sex partnerships which had already ended at the time of its entry into force and that it strictly concerned same-sex couples still in existence at that time and who would be willing to enter into marriage the court considered that the difference between the situations before and after the passing of law no was essentially an expression of the principle of succession of laws without constitutional implications as regards the right not to be discriminated against as regards the applicability to the present case of additional provision no of law no the madrid high court of justice found that this provision was not applicable to the applicant s case for two main reasons firstly that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of law no referred additional provision no was as the constitutional court had established of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of law no it had not been intended to govern future situations secondly that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant additional provision no of law no was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out-of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter s death the inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision no of law no was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time the institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals on the contrary same-sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before law no since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples furthermore the court contended that the applicant could never have fulfilled the more uxorio marital cohabitation requirement established by additional provision no of law no of because only those who were in principle eligible for marriage but had been prevented from marrying for whatever reason could qualify for de facto marital cohabitation the applicant and his partner could have never cohabited as if married before the entry into force of law no because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law recurso de casación para la unificación de doctrina in a decision of june the supreme court social chamber declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison specifically a judgment of the high court of justice of the canary islands of november was not relevant that decision was served on july relying on articles principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination and right to effective judicial protection the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the constitutional court in a decision of february served on february the constitutional court declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had failed to substantiate the special constitutional relevance of his complaints the relevant provisions of the spanish constitution read as follows it is incumbent upon the public authorities to promote conditions which ensure that the freedom and equality of individuals and of the groups to which they belong be real and effective to remove obstacles which prevent or hinder their full enjoyment of these rights and to facilitate the participation of all citizens in political economic cultural and social life all spaniards are equal before the law and may not in any way be discriminated against on account of birth race sex religion opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance. men and women shall have the right to enter into a marriage with full legal equality the law shall determine the forms of marriage the requisite age and capacity for marriage the rights and duties of the spouses the grounds for separation and dissolution and the effects thereof. the state authorities shall ensure that the family is afforded social economic and legal protection the relevant provision of the civil code reads as follows statutes shall not have retroactive effect unless otherwise provided therein the relevant provisions of the divorce act read as follows on a provisional basis until a definitive regulation is enacted in the relevant legislation the following rules shall apply in matters concerning pensions and social security for those who have not been able to marry on account of the legislation in force until now but who have lived as a married couple when the death of one of the partners has occurred before the entry into force of the present law the survivor will be entitled to the benefits provided for in the first paragraph of the present provision and to the corresponding pension in accordance with the following paragraph the right to a survivor s pension and other passive rights to benefits on account of a death shall be awarded to the person who has been the legal spouse in proportion to the time lived with the deceased spouse irrespective of the causes that had determined the separation or divorce under section of the general social security act nonmarital relationships did not entitle the survivor to a survivor s pension even where the persons concerned had lived together accordingly the award of a survivor s pension was conditional on the existence of a lawful marriage between the deceased and the claimant/survivor marriage was deemed to be lawful when it had been celebrated in accordance with one of the forms established by article of the civil code the relevant parts of law no read as follows the legislature has decided to remove a long history of discrimination based on sexual orientation the establishment of a personal framework that allows those who freely adopt sexual and emotional ties with persons of their own sex to develop their personality and exercise their rights under equal conditions is demanded by the citizens of our time and this law intends to provide a response to that demand certainly when the constitution mandates the legislature to regulate marriage it does not rule out in any way whatsoever a regulation defining partner relationships in a different way than does the regulation existing to date a regulation covering new forms of life-partner relationships moreover the option reflected in this law has some constitutional foundations that should be taken into account by the legislature hence the promotion of effective equality between citizens in the free development of their personality articles and of the constitution the protection of freedom in so far as forms of coexistence are concerned article of the constitution and the establishment of a framework of real equality and enjoyment of rights without discrimination on account of sex opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance article of the constitution are values established in the constitution that should be reflected in the rules defining the status of citizenship in a free pluralistic and open society from this broad perspective the regulation of marriage that is hereby established aims at conforming to the manifest reality of spanish society in which changes have been brought about in that society with the involvement of groups seeking total equality for all in the enjoyment of rights regardless of their sexual orientation this is a reality that demands a framework establishing rights and duties for all those who formalise their partner relationships in this context this law allows marriage to be celebrated between persons of the same or different sex with full and equal rights and duties irrespective of its composition accordingly the effects of marriage which are wholly maintained in respect of the objective make-up of the institution shall be the same in all spheres regardless of the sex of the spouses this includes amongst other areas the sphere of social rights and benefits as well as the possibility of being a party to adoption proceedings on the other hand and as a consequence of the first additional provision of this act all references to marriage included in our legal system shall be understood as applicable both to a marriage between two persons of the same sex and to a marriage between two persons of the opposite sex. the civil code is modified as follows a second paragraph is added to article with the following wording marriage shall have the same requirements and effects whether the spouses are of the same or different sex. legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage shall be understood as applicable irrespective of the sex of its members. law no which entered into force on january amended article of the general social security act article recognising for the first time the right to a survivor s pension for unmarried couples heterosexual or homosexual who had lived together continuously for more than five years before the death of the insured partner in addition the third additional provision of this law extended retroactively this right to de facto partners who had been widowed prior to the entry into force of the law and where the survivor was found in situations of particular need in this regard the third additional provision established among other requirements that the couple had had children together the claim had to be filed within a period of twelve months of the entry into force of law no see muñoz díaz v. spain no echr in its decision no of july the constitutional court dismissed an amparo appeal which requested that the equivalent effects as marriage be granted to the more uxorio cohabitation of two homosexuals for the purposes of a survivor s pension it stated that in the same way as a heterosexual couple cohabiting a partnership between persons of the same biological sex is not a legally regulated institution nor is its establishment embodied in a constitutional right quite the opposite to marriage between a man and a woman which is a constitutional right article of the constitution the court upheld the constitutionality of the heterosexual principle as the defining criterion of a marital bond consequently it accepted that the public powers granted privileged status to a family union consisting of a man and a woman as opposed to a homosexual union the constitutional court relied on the case-law of the court under article of the convention rees v. the united kingdom october series a no and cossey v. the united kingdom september series a no the constitutional court followed the same approach in its decision of october in the case of mata estevez v. spain dec. no echr in which it declared the amparo appeal inadmissible on the grounds that it was ill-founded on september seventy-two members of parliament representing an opposition party at that time brought an action before the constitutional court challenging the constitutionality recurso de inconstitucionalidad of law no they argued that law no denaturalised the concept of marriage set forth in article of the spanish constitution which explicitly referred to men and women in its judgment no of november the constitutional court sitting as a full court dismissed the constitutional action and concluded that law no was fully compliant with article of the constitution as regards the situation before the entry into force of law no the court did not consider that it was necessary to address the issue of whether homosexual couples would have had the constitutional right to marry at that time in its judgment no of february the constitutional court considered that the requirement of having had children to access a survivor s pension in the case of de facto unions established by the third additional provision of law no see paragraph above was in breach of the principle of equality before the law enshrined in article of the constitution the constitutional court was of the view that the difference in treatment established by the law based on the requirement of having had children together led to a disproportionate result by denying certain survivors of unmarried couples homosexual and heterosexual couples who had not had their own or adopted children together for legal or biological reasons access to the protection provided by the pension it therefore concluded that the difference in treatment lacked an objective and reasonable justification the court considered that it was not necessary to examine whether the impugned provision was also discriminatory on grounds of sexual orientation as to the effects of this ruling the constitutional court indicated that the fact of declaring unconstitutional the requirement of having had children together as established by the third additional provision of law no did not mean that those persons who had not filed a claim for a survivor s pension within the deadline of twelve months from the entry into force of the law could now do so nor could this judgment call into question the authority of res judicata of final judgments in which the courts had applied the contested requirement in its judgment no of june the constitutional court examined the constitutionality of article of the general social security act as it stood before the entry into force of law no on social security measures the constitutional court examined this issue in the context of an amparo appeal lodged by an appellant who complained under article of the constitution about the denial of a survivor s pension following the death of his homosexual partner in before the entry into force of law no the court referred to the margin of appreciation of the legislature in the area of social security rights and to the court s decision in mata estevez v. spain cited above where the court had accepted that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the survivor s pensions social security scheme was not in breach of article taken in conjunction with article of the convention in the view of the constitutional court it was solely for the legislature to decide when to extend the right to a survivor s pension to other situations and to what extent to do so this is what the spanish legislature had done by introducing same-sex marriage in thus allowing same-sex couples to enter into marriage and benefit from survivors pensions and by extending in the right to a survivor s pension to stable de facto unions both heterosexual and homosexual under certain conditions according to the court this was the legislature s policy choice and the situation existing before could not of itself be considered incompatible with the principle of equality as protected by article of the constitution the constitutional court applied the principles set out in its judgment no and therefore rejected on the merits several amparo appeals including those where the appellant had relied on the application by analogy of additional provision no of law no following the entry into force of law no see for instance judgments no of july no of october in which the public prosecutor had supported the grant of the amparo relief to the individuals concerned in its judgment of april the supreme court social chamber ruled on an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law on the specific issue of survivors pensions for same-sex couples in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of law no the supreme court noted that law no did not contain any transitional provision giving retroactive effect vis-à-vis situations predating the entry into force of the law nor was it possible to apply by analogy additional provision no of law no which concerned only cohabiting heterosexual couples who had been prevented from marrying because divorce had not been legal before the situation of same-sex couples before was totally different in that same-sex marriage was not regulated at all and there had been no constitutional right to same-sex marriage before that date in the view of the supreme court law no had not been enacted to put an end to a previous situation of discrimination which ran contrary to the constitution its purpose was to create a new set of rights and obligations for same-sex couples with only ex nunc effects for the future the judgment of the supreme court contained a dissenting opinion authored by judge f. salinas molina which was joined by four other judges of the social chamber the dissenting judges considered that additional provision no of law no should be applied by analogy to same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying before this application by analogy was based on the similarity between the two situations existence of a legal impediment to enter into marriage before the entry into force of a new law and impossibility to marry after that date due to the death of one of the members of the couple and on the fact that in both cases the purpose of the pension was to meet the needs of the surviving partner the fact that during the legislative process concerning law no the transitional or retroactive scope of the law had not been discussed did not mean that additional provision no of law no was not applicable by analogy furthermore law no was aimed at securing full equality for same-sex couples in the field of marriage including for the purposes of social rights and benefits accordingly judges should interpret and apply the legislation in conformity with that purpose in order to avoid discriminatory treatment the dissenting judges referred to the case-law of the court as well as article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union in its recommendation on discrimination against homosexuals the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace criticised the various forms of discrimination against homosexuals in certain member states of the council of europe in recommendation on the situation of lesbians and gays in council of europe member states it called on member states among other things to enact legislation to provide for registered partnerships furthermore in recommendation on the more specific subject of the situation of gays and lesbians and their partners in respect of asylum and immigration in the member states of the council of europe it recommended to the committee of ministers that it urge member states inter alia to review their policies in the field of social rights and protection of migrants in order to ensure that homosexual partnership and families are treated on the same basis as heterosexual partnerships and families resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe adopted on april and entitled discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity calls on member states to ensure legal recognition of same-sex partnerships when national legislation envisages such recognition as already recommended by the assembly in by providing inter alia for the same pecuniary rights and obligations as those pertaining to different-sex couples ‘ next of kin status measures to ensure that where one partner in a same-sex relationship is foreign this partner is accorded the same residence rights as would apply if she or he were in a heterosexual relationship recognition of provisions with similar effects adopted by other member states in recommendation cm/rec on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity the committee of ministers recommended that member states examine existing legislative and other measures keep them under review and collect and analyse relevant data in order to monitor and redress any direct or indirect discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity ensure that legislative and other measures are adopted and effectively implemented to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity to ensure respect for the human rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons and to promote tolerance towards them the recommendation also observed as follows where national legislation confers rights and obligations on unmarried couples member states should ensure that it applies in a non-discriminatory way to both samesex and different-sex couples including with respect to survivor s pension benefits and tenancy rights where national legislation recognises registered same-sex partnerships member states should seek to ensure that their legal status and their rights and obligations are equivalent to those of heterosexual couples in a comparable situation where national legislation does not recognise nor confer rights or obligations on registered same-sex partnerships and unmarried couples member states are invited to consider the possibility of providing without discrimination of any kind including against different sex couples same-sex couples with legal or other means to address the practical problems related to the social reality in which they live. the united nations human rights committee has examined the issue of pension rights for same-sex survived partners in two individual cases in both cases the human rights committee found a violation of article of the international covenant on civil and political rights equality before the law and prohibition of discrimination in the first case young v. australia communication no august the human rights committee observed as follows footnotes omitted the committee notes that the state party fails specifically to refer to the impugned sections of the act sections e e and on the basis of which the author was refused a pension because he did not meet with the definition of a member of a couple by not living with a member of the opposite sex the committee observes that the state party does not deny that the refusal of a pension on this basis is a correct interpretation of the vea but merely refers to other grounds in the act on which the author s application could have been rejected the committee considers that a plain reading of the definition member of a couple under the act suggests that the author would never have been in a position to draw a pension regardless of whether he could meet all the other criteria under the vea as he was not living with a member of the opposite sex the state party does not contest this consequently it remains for the committee to decide whether by denying a pension under the vea to the author on the ground that he was of the same sex as the deceased mr. c the state party has violated article of the covenant the committee recalls its earlier jurisprudence that the prohibition against discrimination under article comprises also discrimination based on sexual orientation it recalls that in previous communications the committee found that differences in the receipt of benefits between married couples and heterosexual unmarried couples were reasonable and objective as the couples in question had the choice to marry with all the entailing consequences it transpires from the contested sections of the vea that individuals who are part of a married couple or of a heterosexual cohabiting couple who can prove that they are in a marriage-like relationship fulfill the definition of member of a couple and therefore of a dependant for the purpose of receiving pension benefits in the instant case it is clear that the author as a same sex partner did not have the possibility of entering into marriage neither was he recognized as a cohabiting partner of mr. c for the purpose of receiving pension benefits because of his sex or sexual orientation the committee recalls its constant jurisprudence that not every distinction amounts to prohibited discrimination under the covenant as long as it is based on reasonable and objective criteria the state party provides no arguments on how this distinction between same-sex partners who are excluded from pension benefits under law and unmarried heterosexual partners who are granted such benefits is reasonable and objective and no evidence which would point to the existence of factors justifying such a distinction has been advanced in this context the committee finds that the state party has violated article of the covenant by denying the author a pension on the basis of his sex or sexual orientation. in the case of x. v. colombia communication no march the human rights committee held as follows footnotes omitted the author claims that the refusal of the colombian courts to grant him a pension on the grounds of his sexual orientation violates his rights under article of the covenant the committee takes note of the state party s argument that a variety of social and legal factors were taken into account by the drafters of the law and not only the mere question of whether a couple live together and that the state party has no obligation to establish a property regime similar to that established in act no of for all the different kinds of couples and social groups who may or may not be bound by sexual or emotional ties it also takes note of the state party s claim that the purpose of the rules governing this regime was simply to protect heterosexual unions not to undermine other unions or cause them any detriment or harm the committee notes that the author was not recognized as the permanent partner of mr. y for pension purposes because court rulings based on act no of found that the right to receive pension benefits was limited to members of a heterosexual de facto marital union the committee recalls its earlier jurisprudence that the prohibition against discrimination under article comprises also discrimination based on sexual orientation it also recalls that in previous communications the committee found that differences in benefit entitlements between married couples and heterosexual unmarried couples were reasonable and objective as the couples in question had the choice to marry or not with all the ensuing consequences the committee also notes that while it was not open to the author to enter into marriage with his same-sex permanent partner the act does not make a distinction between married and unmarried couples but between homosexual and heterosexual couples the committee finds that the state party has put forward no argument that might demonstrate that such a distinction between samesex partners who are not entitled to pension benefits and unmarried heterosexual partners who are so entitled is reasonable and objective nor has the state party adduced any evidence of the existence of factors that might justify making such a distinction in this context the committee finds that the state party has violated article of the covenant by denying the author s right to his life partner s pension on the basis of his sexual orientation. in the case of atala riffo and daughters v. chile merits reparations and costs judgment of february series c no the interamerican court of human rights considered that the decision of the chilean courts to remove three children from the custody of their lesbian mother constituted discriminatory treatment against her on the basis of her sexual orientation in breach of her right to equality article in conjunction with article of the american convention on human rights and her right to private and family life article and of the american convention with regard to the presumed right of ms atala riffo s children to live in a normal and traditional family an argument used by the chilean courts the inter-american court of human rights observed as follows footnotes omitted the court confirms that the american convention does not define a limited concept of family nor does it only protect a traditional model of the family in this regard the court reiterates that the concept of family life is not limited only to marriage and must encompass other de facto family ties in which the parties live together outside of marriage international case law is consistent on this point in the case of salgueiro da silva mouta v. portugal the european court considered that the decision of a national court to remove an underage child from the custody of a homosexual parent with the argument that the child should live in a traditional portuguese family lacked a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the measure taken withdrawal of the custody and the purpose sought protection of the best interest of the minor similarly in the case of karner v. austria the european court of human rights stated that the aim of protecting the family in the traditional sense is rather abstract and a broad variety of concrete measures may be used to implement it as is the position where there is a difference in treatment based on sex or sexual orientation the principle of proportionality does not merely require that the measure chosen is in principle suited for realizing the aim sought it must also be shown that it was necessary in order to achieve that aim to exclude certain categories of people in the instant case this court finds that the language used by the supreme court of chile regarding the girls alleged need to grow up in a normally structured family that is appreciated within its social environment and not in an exceptional family reflects a limited stereotyped perception of the concept of family which has no basis in the convention since there is no specific model of family the traditional family the inter-american commission on human rights in its report no of april case angel alberto duque v. colombia examined a case in which the applicant complained that he had been denied a survivor s pension on account of his sexual orientation the inter-american commission considered as follows footnotes omitted since evaluating whether a distinction is reasonable and objective must be done on a case-by-case basis the commission the court and other international courts and agencies have made use of a standard test involving several elements i the existence of a legitimate goal ii the suitability or logical means-to-end relationship between the goal sought and the distinction iii the necessity in order words whether other less burdensome and equally suitable alternatives exist and iv proportionality strictu sensu i.e. the balance between the interests at stake and the level of sacrifice required from one party compared to the level of benefit of the other based on this the commission must now assess whether the exclusion of same sex couples from the right to a survivors pension pursued a legitimate aim and if so whether such restriction complied with the requirements of suitability necessity and proportionality in the chapter on established facts the commission has shown that the decision to deny mr. duque a survivor s pension as jojg s permanent partner was expressly and exclusively based on the fact that they were a same-sex couple the commission notes that no other reasons were cited —not in the reply from colfondos not in the tutela action and not in the case file with the iachr— in particular when confirming the lower-court ruling the twelfth circuit civil law court of bogotá maintained that the exclusion of same-sex couples was justified based on the fact that the survivor s pension was intended to protect the family understood as being formed by the union of a man and a woman the only beings capable of preserving the species through procreation. in this vein the commission notes that the reasons to exclude the alleged victim from the right to a survivor s right which were given both by administrative and judicial authorities stemmed from the need to protect the family preliminarily the commission considers that such purpose could in the abstract constitute legitimate goals that the state could pursue when restricting rights however as for the suitability requirement the commission finds that the reasoning offered by administrative and judicial authorities works only if one assumes a narrow and stereotyped understanding of the concept of family which arbitrarily excludes diverse forms of families such as those formed by same-sex couples which are deserving of equal protection under the american convention in effect the inter-american court has established that the american convention does not define a limited concept of family nor does it only protect a ‘ traditional model of the family the commission considers that there is no causal relationship between the means used and the goal pursued failing to satisfy the suitability requirement hence the other requirements for the legitimacy of the restriction need not be examined furthermore the fact that subsequent case law of the constitutional court expanded legal protection to include all types of families shows that there was no reason to maintain that narrow concept of family in view of the above the commission finds that the state violated the principle of equal justice and non-discrimination recognized in article of the american convention read in conjunction with the obligations to respect and ensure the rights as set forth in articles and of the convention to the detriment of ángel alberto duque. on october the inter-american commission submitted the case to the inter-american court in duque v. colombia preliminary exceptions merits reparations and costs judgment of february series c no the inter-american court concluded that colombia had breached the principle of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in article of the american convention read in conjunction with article it considered that the exclusion of same sex couples from the right to a survivors pension under the colombian legislation applicable at the time of the facts had been discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation the fact that the constitutional court had declared that exclusion unconstitutional in had not remedied the violation since it was not clear that

the case originated in an application no against the republic of malta lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by twentyfour maltese nationals and a company registered in malta see appendix for details the applicants on july the applicants were represented by dr j. camilleri a lawyer practising in valletta the maltese government the government were represented by their agent dr p. grech attorney general the applicants alleged that they had been suffering an ongoing interference with their property rights in breach of article of protocol no to the convention they also considered that they were being discriminated against with regard to the enjoyment of their property since as the law stood they were obliged to renew their rent agreement on a yearly basis while people having commercial rents had been freed from such obligation through amendments introduced to the civil code in on january the application was communicated to the government the applicants are joint owners of the property at number republic street valletta the property known as the king s own band club hereinafter referred to as the kobc is a fourstorey building of square metres and is located in a prime site in malta s capital city initially the property belonged to the applicants ascendants in the applicants ascendants entered into a rent agreement with the kobc whereby they willingly rented the said property for pounds sterling gbp annually around euros eur in legislation specifically regulating the lease of property to band clubs act v of hereinafter the amendments was introduced by law the civil code read in conjunction with the reletting of urban property regulation ordinance see relevant domestic law below the applicants are obliged to renew on an annual basis the lease entered into by their ascendants and may not demand an increase in rent according to the applicants the property s market rental value in was eur annually part of the property is utilised as a band club and part of the property is operated as a restaurant and bar the applicants claim that the operation of the restaurant and bar is a profitable economic activity that generates an income to the caterer of around eur or more annually in amendments were introduced to allow for increases in certain rents and to establish a cut-off date for existing protected leases relating to commercial properties which are thus to come to an end in these amendments did not affect the applicants property which is rented out as a band club the amendments however also gave the relevant minister the power to regulate conditions relating to clubs thus allowing for the possibility of future amendments see paragraph below in the applicants filed proceedings before the civil court first hall in its constitutional jurisdiction the proceedings were brought against the attorney general hereinafter referred to as the ag the prime minister hereinafter referred to as the pm and the king s own band club the lessee the applicants claimed that their right to peaceful enjoyment of the property as protected under article of protocol no to the convention was being breached they claimed that they were being denied the use of their property without being provided with adequate compensation the applicants further submitted that in the law had been amended allowing for an increase in rent and the establishment of a cutoff date for existing protected rents but the amendments in the law did not cover properties rented out as clubs therefore in contrast with other commercial rents the annual rent for the club could not be raised and the rent contract could not be terminated the applicants claimed that the law was discriminatory and was therefore in violation of article of the convention on october the civil court first hall in its constitutional jurisdiction found that the applicants had suffered a violation of article of protocol no to the convention in so far as the interference with the applicants property rights had not been proportionate the applicants had submitted that the property had a rental value of eur a year while the ag and the pm had submitted that the property had a rental value of eur a year irrespective of which value one was to consider the court concluded that the rent being received by the applicants was disproportionate keeping in mind the estimated rental values presented before the court and the income that the kobc was generating from its bar the court awarded eur in damages to the applicants to be paid half by the ag and the pm jointly and half by the kobc the costs of the proceedings were to be paid half by the ag and pm and the other half by the kobc the court further concluded that the applicants had not suffered any discrimination as no satisfactory proof had been presented showing that they were discriminated against when compared to other owners leasing their property as a club the ag pm and kobc filed an appeal before the constitutional court on february the constitutional court overturned in part the judgment of the firstinstance court and concluded that there had been no violation of the applicants rights the constitutional court ordered that the costs of proceedings at both instances be paid by the applicants the constitutional court found that contrary to that pleaded by the government the applicants did have title of ownership over the property at issue however in line with domestic case-law the constitutional court concluded that because the agreement had been entered into voluntarily with full knowledge of the consequences it would lead to that is that the rent due could not be raised and the rent agreement could not be terminated then the applicants could not allege a violation of their rights this was so even if due to the rate of inflation throughout the years the rent due was now to be considered low the constitutional court further held that the amendments to the law of mentioned by the applicants did not affect their position which remained the same as that when the rent agreement had been entered into in and therefore there was no reason for the principle of pacta sunt servanda agreements must be complied with not to be given full effect on may the applicants filed an application for retrial they claimed that the constitutional court had committed an error of fact and applied a wrong interpretation of the law they noted that the protection given in law to clubs was introduced in while their predecessors in title had entered into a lease agreement in nevertheless the applicants also instituted proceedings before this court on july on february the constitutional court rejected the applicants request for a retrial the constitutional court held that as the law stood retrial could not be applied in regard to a case of a constitutional nature the costs of the proceedings were to be paid by the applicants pending the constitutional redress proceedings on appeal on january the conditions regulating the leases of clubs regulations hereinafter ‘ the regulations subsidiary

the present case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on october within the three-month period laid down by articles para and art art of the convention the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the commission on may under article art by mr per krohn rasmussen a danish national the commission 's request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under article of the convention taken in conjunction with articles and art art in response to the inquiry made in accordance with rule para d of the rules of court the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the court and designated the lawyer who would represent him rule the chamber of seven judges to be constituted included as ex officio members mr. j. gersing the elected judge of danish nationality article of the convention art and mr. g. wiarda the president of the court rule para b on october the president drew by lot in the presence of the registrar the names of the five other members namely mr. m. zekia mr. w. ganshof van der meersch mr. f. matscher mr. b. walsh and mr. r. macdonald article in fine of the convention and rule para art subsequently mr. zekia and mr. walsh who were prevented from taking part in the consideration of the case were replaced by mr. c. russo and mrs. d. bindschedler-robert substitute judges rules para and para mr. wiarda who had assumed the office of president of the chamber rule para ascertained through the registrar the views of the agent of the danish government the government the delegate of the commission and the representative of the applicant regarding the necessity for a written procedure rule para on november the president directed that the agent and the representative should each have until february to file a memorial and that the delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months from the date of the transmission to him by the registrar of whichever of the aforesaid documents should last be filed on february the president extended the first time-limit until march the government 's and the applicant 's memorials were received at the registry on march on april the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would reply at the hearing after consulting through the registrar the agent of the government the commission 's delegate and the applicant 's representative the president directed on may that the oral hearings should open on june rule on november he had granted to the representative leave to use the danish language on this occasion rule para on may the registrar acting on the instructions of the president requested the commission and the government to produce certain documents which were received on and june the hearings were held in public on june at the human rights building immediately before they opened the court had held a preparatory meeting there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr. lehmann and mr. melchior for the government by mr. opsahl for the commission and by mrs. lindgård for the applicant as well as replies to its questions the applicant mr per krohn rasmussen is a danish citizen born in he currently works as a clerk and resides in nyborg he was married in during the marriage two children were born a boy in and a girl pernille on january the applicant had grounds even before the latter 's birth for assuming that another man might be the father however in order to save the marriage he took no steps to have paternity determined in june mr. rasmussen and his wife applied for a separation separation ved bevilling which they obtained on august in accordance with their agreement mrs. rasmussen retained custody of the children and the competent authority issued a decision to the effect that mr. rasmussen should pay maintenance for them from september he in fact did so from that date until june in march the applicant who had previously still nurtured hopes of preserving the marriage took some steps to institute proceedings to challenge his paternity of pernille to this end he applied for legal aid however he did not pursue the matter since on april he and his wife signed an agreement whereby she waived all claims for maintenance for the child and he undertook to refrain from bringing any such proceedings in june the applicant and his wife applied for a divorce skilmisse ved bevilling which was granted on july on this occasion he reaffirmed before the authorities that the mother should have sole custody of the children and was once more ordered to pay maintenance for them he did not raise any objection on january four days before pernille 's fifth birthday the applicant 's former wife wrote to him asserting that she was not bound by the agreement of april she later lodged with the public authorities a renewed petition for maintenance which was granted by order effective from march since then mr. rasmussen has regularly paid the maintenance on january mr. rasmussen sought leave from the eastern court of appeal østre landsret to institute proceedings out of time to determine the paternity of the girl see paragraph below in accordance with the normal procedure the police at the court of appeal 's request interviewed mr. rasmussen and his former wife in march and recorded their statements in a report the court of appeal refused the application on april for the reason that the statutory conditions for granting leave at that time were not satisfied see paragraph below the applicant did not appeal against the decision within the statutory time-limit however on july he petitioned the ministry of justice for leave to appeal out of time to the supreme court højesteret but this was refused on september on november mr. rasmussen applied again to the court of appeal for leave to institute paternity proceedings his former wife opposed the application on the ground that such proceedings would have a detrimental effect on the child by a decision of december the court of appeal refused the application for the reason that the applicant had not brought the action contesting paternity within the time-limits provided for in section of the act on the legal status of children the act lov nr af om børns retsstilling see paragraph below and that there was no cause to grant him any exemption since the conditions laid down in section were not met a similar decision was given by the supreme court on january prior to the enactment of the act which applied in mr. rasmussen 's case the status of children was regulated in the illegitimacy act of and the legitimacy act of the same year section of the latter provided that proceedings to contest paternity of a legitimate child could be instituted by the mother the husband the child or a person appointed guardian of the child no time-limit was laid down for the institution of such proceedings according to danish case-law and legal writing however a husband could be estopped from contesting paternity of a child born in wedlock if knowing that his wife had had sexual intercourse with another man during the relevant period he had expressly or tacitly acknowledged after the child 's birth that he was the father the doctrine of acknowledgement anerkendelseslaeren was first established in by a judgment of the supreme court reported in ugeskrift for retsvaesen u.f.r p. although there was no case-law on the point legal writers expressed the view that this doctrine applied also to mothers see for instance ernst andersen aegteskabsret i p. in december the ministry of justice set up a committee called the paternity committee to consider inter alia certain aspects of the status of children born in wedlock in june the committee submitted its report no on the amendment of the rules regarding determination of paternity as to the husband 's right to institute proceedings to challenge paternity of a child born in wedlock the committee recommended the institution of a double time-limit of six months from the time when the husband became aware of the facts affording grounds for contesting his paternity and not later than three years from the birth of the child but that the ministry of justice should be empowered to grant exemption from these time-limits in special circumstances the committee took the view that the welfare of the child and of the marriage required that his status should be established as soon as possible and that the husband 's interests should yield to these considerations page of the report one of the reasons given by the committee for this recommendation was that a paternity suit instituted by the husband several years after the child 's birth would place the child in a worse position than if proceedings had been instituted earlier the court would possibly have to give judgment in the husband 's favour on the basis of the blood-group determination while it would be difficult to obtain a paternity and a maintenance order against another man on the other hand the committee found that the child 's right to institute proceedings should not be subject to any time-limit since the views which might lead to restricting the husband 's right to institute proceedings were not of relevance in the case of an action brought by the child for the same reasons there should likewise be no time-limit with regard to actions brought by the child 's guardian or the mother page of the report the committee also discussed the question whether the doctrine of acknowledgement should be embodied in legislation however it considered that this was a matter which was better left to the courts to decide on a case-by-case basis the government subsequently introduced a bill which incorporated in part the recommendations of the paternity committee but increased the time-limits to twelve months and five years respectively and conferred competence to grant exemption on the courts of appeal this legislation entered into force as the act on january it provided in section that proceedings to challenge paternity of a child could be brought by the husband the mother the child or a guardian of the child sub-sections and of section read as follows paternity proceedings must be instituted by the husband within twelve months after he becomes cognizant of the circumstances which may give grounds for his renunciation of paternity and not later than five years after the birth of the child however a court of appeal may on the conditions set out in section sub-section of the administration of justice act grant leave to institute proceedings after the expiry of the time-limits set out in sub-section above section sub-section of the administration of justice act concerns re-opening of a paternity case after the expiry of the applicable time-limit or time-limits it provides that leave may be granted by a court of appeal if quite exceptional reasons are given as to why a review was not sought earlier if the particular circumstances of the case especially warrant it and if it can be assumed that the re-opening will not cause the child any great inconvenience the act did not impose any restriction on the mother 's right to institute paternity proceedings nor did it refer to the doctrine of acknowledgement see paragraph above in case-law however the doctrine of acknowledgement continued to be applied and there were court of appeal and supreme court decisions confirming the earlier view that the doctrine also applied to mothers the circumstances which under the doctrine of acknowledgement estop the husband from contesting paternity will as a general rule also militate against granting him leave to institute proceedings out of time however a decision to grant leave is without prejudice to the outcome of the subsequent procedure see the eastern court of appeal 's judgment of u.f.r p. in the ministry of justice set up a committee called the matrimonial committee to consider whether the evolution of social conditions and notably the changes in the social status of women and the resultant changes in the conception of the institution of marriage since the introduction of the act called for amendment of inter alia the provisions governing the legal status during marriage and after separation or divorce of children born in wedlock in fact the proportion of women working outside their homes has increased to about per cent as a result men are to a much higher degree than before looking after the children and are more frequently granted their custody in the event of separation or divorce mothers are therefore now more likely to challenge paternity in order to prevent custody being given to the husband in a report on cohabitation without marriage samliv uden aegteskab i no p. published in january the matrimonial committee stated there is consensus in the committee that also the mother 's right to institute paternity proceedings and request re-opening should be subject to a relatively short time-limit for example corresponding to the time-limits which today apply to the father furthermore the committee is to some degree in favour of an absolute time-limit applicable to all for instituting and re-opening paternity proceedings on the basis of the recommendations of the matrimonial committee the government tabled a bill before parliament in march proposing certain amendments to the act the explanatory memorandum to this bill referred to the rasmussen case then pending before the european commission on page it mentioned that the agent of the government had declared in evidence before the commission that new legislation on the matter would be introduced establishing uniform time-limits within which both men and women could contest the husband 's paternity the memorandum added that the ministry of justice considered such legislation desirable in the interest of the child 's needs af hensyn til barnets tarv on may the danish legislature passed an act amending the act which entered into force on july following this amendment sub-sections and of section of the act now provide paternity proceedings must be instituted not later than three years after the birth of the child this provision shall not apply however where proceedings are instituted by the child after having attained the age of a court of appeal may grant leave to institute proceedings after the expiry of the time-limit set out in the first sentence of sub-section of this section where quite exceptional grounds are given as to why proceedings were not instituted at an earlier stage in circumstances where institution of proceedings is especially warranted and where it can be presumed that the proceedings will not cause the child any great inconvenience the doctrine of acknowledgement is still applied by the danish courts to estop spouses from contesting paternity of a child see the supreme court 's judgment of january in his application of may to the commission no mr. rasmussen alleged that he had been subjected to discrimination based on sex in that under the relevant danish law applicable at the time his former wife had an unlimited right of access to court to challenge his paternity whilst he did not the commission declared the application admissible on december in its report adopted on july article of the convention art the commission expressed the opinion that there had been a breach of article taken in conjunction with articles and art art eight votes against five the full text of the commission 's opinion and of the separate opinion contained

the case originated in an application no against the republic of turkey lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a turkish political party özgürlük ve dayanışma partisi the freedom and solidarity party the applicant party on october before the court the applicant party was represented by mr m. bektaş a lawyer practising in ankara the turkish government the government were represented by their agent the applicant party which had been granted the right to take part in the next parliamentary elections alleged that it had been discriminated against on account of the refusal of its application for the financial assistance to political parties available under the constitution on july the application was communicated to the government the court also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time the applicant party özgürlük ve dayanışma partisi the ödp is a turkish political party based in ankara by a decree of november the higher electoral commission published a list of the eighteen political parties authorised to participate in the parliamentary and municipal elections to be held on april the ödp featured on the list in order to be able to participate in the elections in question the political parties had to have had for at least six months prior to the elections branches in no fewer than half the country s provinces and to have already organised their party conference on september the ödp applied to the ministry of finance for the financial assistance available to political parties under article of the constitution by a decision of november the ministry of finance refused the application on the ground that only political parties meeting the criteria laid down by law no on political parties were eligible for public funding on december the ödp brought proceedings in the seeking the setting-aside of the decision of november the ödp began by pointing out that the constitution itself provided that the state shall grant political parties sufficient and equitable funding and that the law shall define the principles applicable to party funding members subscriptions and donations the applicant party observed in particular that the criteria laid down by the law on political parties excluded parties which were not represented in parliament from entitlement to state subsidies pointing to the difficulty of carrying out political activities and campaigning without the necessary financial resources it contended that the statutory exclusion was unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of a democratic state to the state s duty to promote democratic rights and freedoms and to the principle of nondiscrimination furthermore the provisions in question were in breach of international human rights protection instruments in a judgment of september the ankara administrative court rejected the application lodged by the ödp on the ground that the latter did not satisfy the criteria laid down by law no on political parties the court did not rule on the plea of unconstitutionality raised by the ödp the ödp lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of september reiterating the arguments it had submitted at first instance in a judgment delivered on april and served on the applicant party on july the supreme administrative court upheld the impugned judgment which it found to be in accordance with the rules of procedure and law the final paragraph of article of the constitution states that the state shall grant political parties sufficient and equitable funding and that the law shall define the principles applicable to party funding members subscriptions and donations under additional section of law no on political parties the state provides financial assistance the overall amount of which represents of its budget to the political parties represented in parliament in proportion to the number of votes they obtained in the preceding parliamentary elections political parties that are not represented in parliament are also entitled to this assistance provided that they obtained at least of the votes cast in the preceding election parties with at least three members of parliament are also eligible even if they did not participate in the last election the funding provided to political parties is tripled in a parliamentary election year and doubled in a municipal election year by a judgment of november the turkish constitutional court dismissed by a majority a plea of unconstitutionality raised by the ankara administrative court which alleged that the statutory threshold imposed on political parties in order to obtain state funding was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional in making its ruling the considered that one of the aims of political parties was to obtain electoral support with a view to participating in government and hence contributing to the expression of the opinion of the people it concluded from this that parties which had not obtained a sufficient level of electoral support did not contribute to the expression of the opinion of the people to the same extent as political parties with broader popular support it dismissed the argument that using the extent of parties contribution to democratic political life as the criterion for allocating state funding was not objective equitable or proportionate a minority of the judges of the constitutional court took the view that the threshold was too high corresponding to almost three million votes in the referendum that it gave an unfair advantage to political parties which exceeded it and that the criterion based on the contribution to the expression of the opinion of the people was subjective and in breach of the principle of the rule of law the ödp obtained of the valid votes cast in the parliamentary elections of april of the vote in the elections of november and of the vote in the elections the parties that received funding prior to the elections in question had either won seats in the national assembly in the preceding parliamentary elections or had obtained more than of the valid votes cast in those elections ahead of the general election six political parties including one that was not represented in parliament of the twenty-one parties fielding candidates received state financial assistance before the general election six parties including one not represented in parliament of the fifteen parties contesting the election received state funding prior to the election funding was given to five of the fifteen parties fielding candidates of the five parties concerned three were not represented in parliament the ödp has never received state funding the relevant passages of the guidelines on political party regulation drawn up by the osce/odihr and the venice commission and adopted by the venice commission at its plenary session venice october cdl-ad read as follows public funding a importance of public funding public funding and its requisite regulations including spending limits disclosure and impartial enforcement has been designed and adopted throughout the globe as a potential means of preventing corruption to support the important role played by political parties and to remove undue reliance on private donors such systems of funding are aimed at ensuring that all parties are able to compete for elections in accordance with the principle of equal opportunity thus strengthening political pluralism and helping to ensure the proper functioning of democratic institutions generally legislation should attempt to create a balance between public and private contributions as the source for political party funding in no case should the allocation of public funding limit or interfere with the independence of a political party the amount of public funding awarded to parties must be carefully designed to ensure the utility of such funding while not eradicating the need for private contributions or nullifying the impact of individual donations while the nature of elections and campaigning in different states makes it impossible to identify a universally applicable amount of funding legislation should put in place review mechanisms aimed at periodically determining the impact of public-finance systems and the need as such exists to alter financial-allocation amounts generally subsidies should be set at a meaningful level to fulfil the objective of support but should not be the only source of income and should not create conditions for over-dependency on state support b financial support legislation should explicitly allow that state support for political parties may be financial the allocation of public money to political parties is often considered integral to respect the principle of equal opportunity for all candidates in particular where the state s funding mechanism includes special provisions for women and minorities where financial support is awarded to parties relevant legislation should develop clear guidelines to determine the amount of such funding which should be allocated to recipients in an objective and unbiased manner c other forms of public support in addition to direct funding the state may offer support to parties in a variety of other ways including tax exemptions for party activities the allocation of free media time or the free use of public meeting halls for the purposes of campaign activities in all such cases both financial and in-kind support must be given on the basis of equality of opportunity to all parties and candidates including women and minorities while ‘ equality may not be absolute in nature a system for determining the proportional or equitable distribution of state support whether financial or in-kind must be objective fair and reasonable d allocation of funding the system for allocating public support to political parties should be determined by relevant legislation some systems allocate money prior to an election based on the results of the previous election or proof of minimum levels of support other systems provide payment after an election based on the final results generally a pre-election disbursement of funds or a percentage of funding best ensures the ability of parties to compete on the basis of equal opportunity the allocation of funding may either be fully equal ‘ absolute equality or proportionate in nature based on a party s election results or proven level of support ‘ equitable there is no universally prescribed system for determining the distribution of public funding some have argued that legislation for public funding is generally most effective at achieving political pluralism and equal opportunity by providing a combination of both absolute and equitable equality where minimum thresholds of support are required for funding it should be considered that an unreasonably high threshold may be detrimental to political pluralism and small political parties further it is in the interest of political pluralism to have a lower threshold for public funding than the electoral threshold for the allocation of a mandate in parliament legislation should ensure that the formula for the allocation of funding does not provide a monopoly or disproportionate amount of funding to one political party nor should the formula for allocation of funding allow the two largest political parties to monopolise the receipt of public funding e requirements to receive public funding at a minimum some degree of public funding should be available to all parties represented in parliament however to promote political pluralism some funding should ideally be extended beyond parties represented in parliament to all parties representative of a minimum level of the citizenry s support and presenting candidates in an election this is particularly important in the case of new parties which must be given a fair opportunity to compete with existing parties public funding by providing increased resources to political parties can increase political pluralism as such it is reasonable for legislation to require a party to be representative of a minimum level of the electorate prior to receipt of funding however as the denial of public funding can lead to a decrease in pluralism and political alternatives it is accepted good practice to enact clear guidelines for how new parties may become eligible for funding and to extend public funding beyond parties represented in parliament a generous system for the determination of eligibility should be considered to ensure that voters are given the political alternatives necessary for a real choice,case originated application republic turkey

showing that in the school year sixteen percent of roma children aged fifteen completed their elementary education compared with ninety-one percent for the general elementary school population in the county the drop-out rate of roma pupils before completing elementary school was eighty-four percent which was times higher than for the general population in school year seventy-three roma children were enrolled in first grade and five in eighth on april the applicants brought an action under section of the administrative disputes act in the čakovec municipal court općinski sud u čakovcu against the above-mentioned primary schools and the kuršanec primary school the state and the defendants they submitted that the teaching organised in the roma-only classes formed in those four schools was significantly reduced in volume and in scope compared to the officially prescribed curriculum the applicants claimed that the described situation was racially discriminating and violated their right to education as well as their right to freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment they requested the court to order the defendants to refrain from such conduct in the future the applicants also produced the results of a psychological study of roma children attending roma-only classes in međimurje carried out immediately before their action was lodged showing the following most children had never had a non-roma child as a friend expressed a wish to have a non-roma child for a friend expressed a wish to attend a mixed class said they felt unaccepted in the school environment stated that roma and non-roma children did not play together furthermore the report asserted that segregated education produced emotional and psychological harm in roma children in terms of lower self-esteem and self-respect and problems in the development of their identity separate classes were seen as an obstacle to creating a social network of roma and non-roma children the defendants each submitted replies to the arguments put forward by the applicants claiming that there was no discrimination of roma children and that pupils enrolled in school were all treated equally they submitted that all pupils were enrolled in school after a committee composed of a doctor a psychologist a pedagogue a social pedagogue and a teacher had given an opinion that the candidates were physically and mentally ready to attend school the classes within a school were formed depending on the needs of the class the number of pupils etc in particular it was important that classes were formed in such a way that they enabled all pupils to study in a stimulating environment furthermore the defendants submitted that pupils of roma origin were grouped together not because of their ethnic origin but rather because they often did not speak croatian well and it took more exercises and repetitions for them to master the subjects taught finally they claimed that roma pupils received the same quality of education as other students as the scope of their curriculum did not differ from that prescribed by law on september the čakovec municipal court dismissed the applicants action accepting the defendants argument that the reason why most roma pupils were placed in separate classes was that they were not fluent in croatian consequently the court held that this was not unlawful and that the applicants had failed to substantiate their allegations concerning racial discrimination lastly the court concluded that the applicants had failed to prove the alleged difference in the curriculum of the roma-only classes on october the applicants appealed against the first-instance judgment claiming that it was arbitrary and contradictory on november the županijski sud u čakovcu dismissed the applicants appeal upholding the reasoning of the first-instance judgment subsequently on december the applicants lodged a complaint with the ustavni sud republike hrvatske under section of the constitutional court act in their constitutional complaint the applicants reiterated their earlier arguments relying on the relevant provisions of the constitution and of the convention on november the applicants lawyer lodged an application with the to expedite the proceedings on february the dismissed the applicants complaint in its decision no u-iii- published in the official gazette no of february the relevant parts of the decision read as follows the first-instance court established in the impugned judgment that the criteria for formation of classes in the defendant elementary schools had been knowledge of the croatian language and not the pupils ethnic origin the first-instance court considered that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that they had been placed in their classes on the basis of their racial and ethnic origin the first-instance court stressed that the complainants relied exclusively on the report on the activities of the ombudsman in the year however the ombudsman said in his evidence that the part of the report referring to the education of roma had been injudicious because all the relevant facts had not been established the first-instance court relied on section paragraph of the elementary education act which provides that teaching in elementary schools is in the croatian language and latin script and considered lack of knowledge of the croatian language as an objective impediment in complying with the requirements of the school curriculum which also transpires from the conclusion of a study carried out for the needs of the croatian helsinki committee the first-instance court found 'pupils enrolling in the first year of elementary schools have to know the croatian language so that they are able to follow the teaching if the purpose of elementary education is to be fulfilled it is therefore logical that classes with children who do not know the croatian language require additional efforts and commitment of teachers in particular to teach them the croatian language the first-instance court found that the defendants had not acted against the law in that they had not changed the composition of classes once established as only in exceptional situations was the transfer of pupils from one class to another allowed the first-instance court considered that this practice respected the completeness of a class and its unity in the upper grades the first-instance court considered that classes should be formed so as to create favourable conditions for an equal approach to all pupils according to the prescribed curriculum and programme which could be achieved only where a class consisted of a permanent group of pupils of approximately the same age and knowledge furthermore the first-instance court found that the complainants had failed to prove their assertion that they had a curriculum of significantly smaller volume than the one prescribed for the elementary schools by the ministry of education and sport on june the first-instance court found that the above assertion of the complainants relied on the ombudsman 's report however the ombudsman said in his testimony that he did not know how the fact that in roma-only classes the teaching followed a so-called special programme had been established the first-instance court established that teaching in the complainants respective classes and the parallel ones followed the same curriculum according to the submitted school curriculum only in the krušanec elementary school were there some deviations from the school curriculum but the first-instance court found those deviations permissible since they had occurred at the beginning of the school year owing to low attendance after having established that the complainants had not been placed in their classes according to their racial and ethnic origin and that the curriculum had been the same in all parallel classes the first-instance court dismissed the complainants action the reasoning of the first-instance judgment shows that the defendant elementary schools replied to the complainants allegations as follows 'the defendant schools enrolled in the first year those children found psycho-physically fit to attend elementary school by a committee composed of a physician a psychologist a school counsellor pedagog a defectologist and a teacher they did not enrol croatian children or roma children as such but children found by the said committee to be psychologically and physically fit to be enrolled in elementary school the defendant elementary schools maintain that the first obstacle for roma children in psychological tests is their lack of knowledge of the croatian language in terms of both expression and comprehension as to the emotional aspect of maturity these children mostly have difficulty channelling their emotions in terms of social maturity children of roma origin do not have the basic hygienic skills of washing dressing tying or buttoning and a lot of time is needed before they achieve these skills it is therefore difficult to plan class structures with sufficient motivation for all children which is one of the obligations of elementary schools there are classes composed of pupils not requiring additional schooling to follow the teaching programme and classes composed of pupils who require supplementary work and assistance from teachers in order to acquire the necessary skills they lack owing to social deprivation the reasoning of the same judgment cites the testimony of m.p.-p. a school counsellor and psychologist in the given on december 'before enrolment the committee questions the children in order to establish whether they possess the skills necessary for attending school classes are usually formed according to the gauss curve so that the majority in a given class are average pupils and a minority below or above average however in a situation where of the population does not speak croatian a different approach is adopted so as to form classes with only pupils who do not speak croatian because in those classes a teacher 's first task is to teach the children the language the above shows that the allocation of pupils to classes is based on the skills and needs of each individual child the approach is individualised and carried out in keeping with professional and pedagogical standards thus the finds the applied approach correct since only qualified experts in particular in the fields of pedagogy school psychology and defectology are responsible for assigning individual children to the appropriate classes the has no reason to question the findings and expert opinions of the competent committees composed of physicians psychologists school counsellors pedagog defectologists and teachers which in the instant case found that the complainants should be placed in separate classes none of the facts submitted to the leads to the conclusion that the placement of the complainants in separate classes was motivated by or based on their racial or ethnic origin the finds that their placement pursued the legitimate aim of necessary adjustment of the elementary educational system to the skills and needs of the complainants where the decisive factor was their lack of knowledge or inadequate knowledge of croatian the language used to teach in schools the separate classes were not established for the purpose of racial segregation in enrolment in the first year of elementary school but as a means of providing children with supplementary tuition in the croatian language and eliminating the consequences of prior social deprivation it is of particular importance to stress that the statistical data on the number of roma children in separate classes in the school-year are not in themselves sufficient to indicate that the defendants practice was discriminatory see also the european court of human rights judgments hugh jordan v. the united kingdom no and d.h. and others v. the czech republic moreover the complainants themselves maintain in their constitutional complaint that in the school-year of roma children in were placed in regular classes which tends to support the 's conclusion that there is no reason to challenge the correct practice of the defendant elementary schools and expert committees in their constitutional complaint the complainants further point out that 'even if lack of knowledge of the croatian language on enrolment in the first year was a problem the same could not be said of the complainants enrolment in upper grades they therefore consider that their rights were violated by the courts findings that it had been justified to maintain separate roma-only classes in the upper grades in order to preserve the stability of the wholeness of a given class the complainants submit that the stability of a class should not have been placed above their constitutional rights multiculturalism and national equality in that regard the accepts the complainants arguments while the constitutional court considers correct and acceptable the courts findings that lack of knowledge of the croatian language represents an objective obstacle justifying the formation of separate classes for children who do not speak croatian at all or speak it badly when they start school bearing in mind the particular circumstance of the present case it can not accept the following conclusion of the first-instance court 'furthermore the wholeness and unity of a class is respected in the upper grades therefore transfer of children from one class to another occurs only exceptionally and in justified cases because a class is a homogeneous whole and transferring children from one class to another would produce stress the continuity of a group is a precondition for the development of a class collective accordingly the can not accept the following view of the appellate court 'the classes are formed when the children enter the first year of their schooling not every year and their composition changes only exceptionally they become a settled whole which makes for work of a higher quality and it is not pedagogically justified to change them therefore this court like the first-instance court concludes that maintaining established classes did not amount to an unlawful act the above views of the courts would have been acceptable had they referred to the usual situations concerning the assignment of pupils to upper grade classes in elementary schools where no objective need for special measures exists such as forming separate classes for children with inadequate command of croatian considering the circumstances of the present case the finds that it is in principle objectively and reasonably justified to maintain separate classes in the upper grades of elementary school only for pupils who have not attained the level of croatian necessary for them to follow the school curriculum of regular classes properly however there is no objective or reasonable justification for not transferring to a regular class a pupil who has attained proficiency in croatian in the lower grades of elementary school and successfully mastered the prescribed school curriculum keeping such a pupil in a separate class against his or her will for reasons unrelated to his or her needs and skills would be unacceptable from the constitutional point of view with regard to the right of equality before the law guaranteed under section paragraph of the constitution a constitutional complaint is a particular constitutional instrument for the protection of a legal subject whose human right or fundamental freedom guaranteed under the constitution has been infringed in an individual act of a state or public body which determined his or her rights and obligations the present constitutional complaint concerns impugned judgments referring to the school year however not a single complainant alleges that in that school year he or she was a pupil in a separate roma-only upper-grade class or was personally affected or concerned by the contested practice although it does not concern the individual legal position of any of the complainants in respect of the complainants general complaint about the maintaining of roma-only classes in the upper grades of elementary school the has addressed the following question was the continued existence of roma-only classes in the upper grades of elementary school caused by the defendants intent to discriminate those pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin none of the facts submitted to the leads to the conclusion that the defendants practice was aimed at discrimination of the roma pupils on the basis of their racial or ethnic origin the complainants further complain of a violation of their right to education on the ground that the teaching organised in those classes was more reduced in volume and in scope than the curriculum for elementary schools adopted by the ministry of education and sport on june they consider that 'their placement in roma-only classes with an inferior curriculum stigmatises them as being different stupid intellectually inferior and children who need to be separated from normal children in order not to be a bad influence on them owing to their significantly reduced and simplified school curriculum their prospects of higher education or enrolment in high schools as well as their employment options or chances of advancement are slimmer after considering the entire case-file the has found that the above allegations are unfounded the case-file including the first-instance judgment shows that the allegations of an inferior curriculum in roma-only classes are not accurate the has no reason to question the facts as established by the competent court the possible difference in curricula between parallel classes for objective reasons for example the low attendance at the krušanec elementary school where in the first term of school year the pupils in classes and missed lessons in total of which were missed for no justified reason does not contravene the requirement that the curriculum be the same in all parallel classes the is obliged to point out that neither the constitution nor the convention guarantees any specific requirements concerning school curricula or their implementation first and foremost the constitution and the convention guarantee a right of access to educational institutions existing in a given state as well as an effective right to education in other words that every person has an equal right to obtain official recognition of the studies which he or she has completed a similar view was expressed by the european court of human rights in a case relating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in belgium v. belgium the finds the evidence submitted in the present proceedings insufficient to show beyond doubt that the complainants had to follow a school curriculum of lesser scope thus the considers the complainants assertion about being stigmatised as a subjective value judgment without reasonable justification the finds no factual support for the complainants assertion that the source of their stigmatisation was an allegedly reduced curriculum owing to which their prospects for further education were lower and dismisses that assertion as arbitrary the competent bodies of the recognise a completed degree of education to everyone irrespective of his or her racial or ethnic origin in that respect everyone is equal before the law with equal chances of advancement according to their abilities. the relevant provisions of the constitution read as follows article everyone in the shall enjoy rights and freedoms regardless of race colour gender language religion political or other belief national or social origin property birth education social status or other characteristics all shall be equal before the law. the relevant part of section of the constitutional act on the ustavni zakon o ustavnom sudu republike hrvatske official gazette no of may the constitutional court act reads as follows section everyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the constitutional court if he or she deems that the individual act of a state body a body of local and regional self-government or a legal person with public authority

convention by two lithuanian nationals mr pijus beizaras the first applicant and mr mangirdas levickas the second applicant on august the applicants who had been granted legal aid were represented by

applicants alleged in particular that they had been discriminated against on the grounds of sexual orientation in breach of article of the convention taken in conjunction with article on account of the public authorities refusal to launch a pre-trial investigation into hateful comments left on the first applicant s facebook page they also argued that the authorities refusal to launch a pre-trial investigation had left them without the possibility of legal redress in breach of article of the convention on june notice of the application was given to the government in addition to written observations submitted by the applicants and the government third-party comments were received jointly from the aire centre advice on individual rights in europe the european branch of the lesbian gay bisexual trans and intersex association ilga-europe the international commission of jurists icj and the human rights monitoring institute the hrmi which had collectively been granted leave by the president of the section to intervene as a third party article of the convention and rule the first applicant was born in and lives in kaunas the second applicant was born in and lives in panevėžys at the time that the application was lodged with the court the first applicant was a secondary-school student at the kaunas school of applied arts he graduated from that school in june he is an openly gay man in a same-sex relationship with the second applicant at the time of the lodging of the application with the court the second applicant was a theology student at the vytautas magnus university in kaunas in august he discontinued his theology studies and instead began studying psychology at the same university both applicants are members of the lgl association as can be seen from the material provided and relied on by the government namely copies of public posts on the facebook pages of the first and the second applicants on december the second applicant publicly posted on facebook that on that day he had met for the first time the first applicant on march the first applicant publicly posted on his facebook account asking do i have any homophobic ‘ friends who are against lgbt people on may the first applicant publicly posted a summary of the main arguments cited by homophobic commenters such as the assertion that homosexuality was a disease and a perversion that was against the laws of nature on may the first applicant stated in a public post that he had excluded homophobic persons from his facebook friends on july the first applicant announced in a public post that he was in a relationship with the second applicant on december the first applicant posted a photograph on his facebook page depicting a same-sex kiss between him and the second applicant the picture was accessible not only to his facebook friends but also to the general public as stated by the applicants in their application to the court the intention of posting the picture publicly was to announce the beginning of the applicants relationship according to the applicants the picture went viral online and it received more than ‘ likes and more than comments they also submitted that the majority of online comments had been aimed at inciting hatred and violence against lgbt people in general while numerous comments had directly threatened the applicants personally the posted comments of which the lithuanian law-enforcement authorities were notified afterwards included the following lithuanian language has not been corrected i m going to throw up they should be

gedos wisgaidy tu krw jabanas galwa po masina pakist ir sniurais suka tu kwr jabanas kill zudyt on december the photograph was re-posted by lgbt-friendly vilnius an organisation upholding the rights of lgbt people on its public facebook page with the following comment two young men who live in kaunas pijus and mangirdas today caused a big commotion on lithuanian facebook pages provoking a huge number of ‘ likes ‘ shares and hateful comments why the reason is simple a kiss nothing more nothing less we asked them what prompted their choice to make this nice photograph public here is pijus wise reply ‘ we hope that maybe some lonely person who is being condemned by others will see this photograph and will no longer feel lonely maybe standing on the roof of some house or on the edge of a window sill or balcony he or she will move to a safer spot where nothing will threaten him or her and his or her life will not be just a statistic. thank you pijus and thank you mangirdas your courage inspires and gives hope let s express our support by sharing the link to the post carrying the photograph and expressing our opinion on december the lgl association on its facebook page shared the photograph and publicly posted the following we are happy about the bravery of these young men now they need support more than ever here on facebook and also in their everyday life so is it just a kiss what is the reaction of lithuanians who avoid being labeled as homophobes please pay attention to their opinions expressed in the comments. later on on december the lgl association stated in a public post on its facebook page homophobia seeps through not only anonymous comments on internet portals but also on facebook where people post under their true names we did as we said we would the meanest comments and their authors have already been denounced to the law-enforcement institutions do express your opinion respectfully and responsibly there are thousands of comments and thousands of people making them you can not catch them all but this is not our purpose it is more important to show society that making such hateful comments is against the law and that hatred can not be tolerated. in that context the government also provided a screenshot of the first applicant s facebook page from december where he had written two years ago we were causing a commotion and provided a link to the photograph in question in june lgbt-friendly vilnius on its facebook page shared both applicants impressions of the baltic pride event the applicants expressed their satisfaction that the parade had gone well and had passed off without incidents such as the throwing of eggs or disruptions staged by supporters of traditional values the two applicants had marched at the forefront of the parade carrying the lithuanian flag on december both applicants lodged a written request with the lgl association of which they were both members see paragraph above asking it to notify in its own name the prosecutor general s office of the hateful comments left under the photograph posted on the first applicant s facebook page they submitted that those comments were not only degrading detrimental to their dignity and incited discrimination but also incited violence and physically violent treatment the comments were therefore frightening both to homosexual people in general and to the applicants in particular the applicants considered that such actions were criminal and merited pre-trial investigation they reasoned in their request that their wish for the lgl association as a non-governmental organisation that defended the public interest to act on their behalf was based on the applicants view that the lithuanian legal system did not provide any additional procedural guarantees for alleged victims of homophobic hate crimes the applicants also wrote that they feared retaliation by the authors of the online comments should they personally lodge such a complaint with the prosecutor they also believed that were they to lodge a personal complaint it would not be treated seriously by law-enforcement officials on december the lgl association lodged a complaint with the prosecutor general s office asking that criminal proceedings be initiated regarding thirty-one comments posted on the first applicant s public facebook page see paragraph above the complaint was lodged on the basis of article and of the criminal code incitement against any national racial ethnic religious or other group of people see paragraph below and article of the law on the provision of information to the public which prohibits publishing in the media information that incites hatred or violence against a group of people because of their sexual orientation see paragraph below it was indicated in the complaint that the comments in question had ridiculed and expressed contempt for individuals of homosexual orientation as well as incited discrimination hatred and violence against them the lgl association also added a hard copy of the photograph in question and the comments posted below it on december a prosecutor at the klaipėda district prosecutor s office took the decision not to initiate a pre-trial investigation regarding the lgl association s complaint having examined the thirty-one comments referred to by the lgl association the prosecutor noted that of those thirty-one comments twenty-seven people had written one comment each and two people had written two comments each for the prosecutor this was easy to establish since the commenters had placed those comments under their personal profiles the prosecutor held that in order to assess whether the comments in question were of a criminal nature it was necessary to take into account not only the comments as such but also the context in which those comments had been written given that the comments had been written by different people each comment had to be assessed individually and not collectively it was also essential to establish whether those comments constituted an active attempt aktyvus siekis to incite other people to disseminate degrading comments and to incite them to commit violence the prosecutor then considered that active attempts required systematic action in the applicants case however such a criterion had not been met because various individuals had written only one or two comments which was not enough to be considered as constituting a systematic attempt to incite hatred or violence against people distinguishable by their sexual orientation from this it followed that the objective element of a crime as established under article and of the criminal code was absent furthermore the fact that the expression of opinion in question had been non-systematic and isolated meant that there had been no subjective element namely that of direct intent in the crime in question because by posting the comments the authors thereof had been merely expressing their opinion instead of seeking to incite hatred or violence against individuals who were distinguishable by their sexual orientation even though the authors of the comments had reacted unethically in respect of the image portrayed in the photograph of the two applicants such immoral behaviour did not constitute an element of a crime under article and of the criminal code the prosecutor lastly considered that the supreme court was of a similar view in view of the fact that by a ruling of december in case no it had acquitted a person who had posted a comment stating that gay people were perverts and belonged in a psychiatric hospital in that case the supreme court had considered that such a comment even though unethical had not actively incited hatred or discrimination against homosexual people for a more detailed description see paragraphs below the prosecutor thus saw that his conclusion was in line with the supreme court s practice in such cases that is to say that comments of such a tenor were unethical but not criminal on january the lgl association lodged an appeal against the prosecutor s decision with the klaipėda city district court the lgl association pointed out that the prosecutor had taken the decision not to prosecute on two grounds firstly that the actions of the people who had commented on the above-mentioned facebook post had not been systematic in nature and secondly that in respect of cases concerning similar situations that is to say comments of a similar nature the authorities routinely considered that no crime had been committed the lgl association noted that in more than of cases in lithuania hatred was promoted through the electronic sphere for example by the creation of hatred-promoting groups on the facebook social network or on internet forums the lgl association also relied on lithuanian court decisions of at district court that is to say first-instance level which had found that a single comment had been sufficient to find the author thereof guilty of a crime under article of the criminal code see paragraphs and below the lgl association thus disputed the prosecutor s conclusion that such actions had to be systematic in nature in order for criminal liability to arise the lgl association argued that the question of whether or not comments could be deemed to be systematic in nature could be taken into account when assessing the gravity of a crime and imposing a punishment on the author of such comments but it did not amount to a constitutive element of that crime as to the applicants case in particular it also argued inter alia that several terms contained in the comments had promoted the infliction of physical harm and even the killing of members of the group in question for example advocating burning and extermination which had indicated their authors particular attitude ypatingą nusiteikimą towards people of non-traditional sexual orientation and had clearly intentionally articulated a call for violence on this point the lgl association relied on the court s judgment in vejdeland v. sweden no and february in which it had held that sweden had not breached the rights of the applicants in that case by prosecuting them even if their statements had not called for violence lastly the lgl association argued that if the comments under the photograph of the applicants on facebook had been only expressing the authors opinion it was totally unclear what could be considered to constitute publicly ridiculing expressing contempt urging hatred or inciting discrimination within the meaning of article of the criminal code that norm of criminal law was destined to become a dead letter which the law-enforcement authorities chose not to apply by giving unjustified preference to freedom of expression or perhaps owing to other motives which although not related to law had an influence on law by a ruling of january the klaipėda city district court dismissed the lgl association s appeal the court shared the prosecutor s view that the authors of the impugned comments had chosen improper words pavartojo netinkamus žodžius to express their disapproval of homosexual people even so the mere use of obscenities tik necenzūrinių žodžių pavartojimas was not enough to incur criminal liability under article of the criminal code the court considered that in making such comments their authors had not been inciting others to discriminate against or hate homosexuals the district court also pointed out that the first applicant s facebook page where the picture of the two men kissing had been posted had been public visible and accessible not only to his acquaintances and friends but also to individuals who were completely unknown to him therefore a person who posted in the public space viešoje erdvėje a picture of two men kissing should and must have foreseen that such eccentric behaviour really did not contribute to the cohesion of those within society who had different views or to the promotion of tolerance ekscentriškas elgesys tikrai neprisideda prie visuomenėje kitokias pažiūras turinčių asmenų tarpusavio supratimo bei tolerancijos ugdymo the owner of a social network profile on which such an image was posted by exercising his freedom to express his convictions and freedom to promote tolerance had to take into account the fact that that freedom was inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions of others according to the court the majority of lithuanian society very much appreciate d traditional family values itin vertina tradicinės šeimos vertybes indeed that view was enshrined in article of the constitution which read that the family should be the basis of society and the state and that marriage should be undertaken on the basis of the free mutual consent of a man and a woman the district court also referred to a passage from the constitutional court s ruling of september see paragraph below and from that ruling inferred that the family as a constitutional value is a union between a man and a woman lastly the court stated that criminal proceedings were an ultima ratio measure and that they should therefore be initiated only when serious grounds and all elements of a crime existed this was not the situation in the case at hand the decision not to prosecute the authors of the comments had been reasonable the lgl association lodged an appeal on january it pleaded that certain comments had been clearly meant to incite violence thus directly constituting an objective element of a crime under article and of the criminal code the lgl association noted that even milder public comments although concerning racial or ethnic discrimination had been considered by the lithuanian courts to constitute a crime the lgl association also argued that the subjective element of a crime that is to say direct intent should be assessed only after the identification of the alleged perpetrators and during subsequent criminal proceedings not at the time that a procedural decision was taken regarding whether to start a pre-trial investigation or not responding to the district court s statement that the majority of lithuanian society very much appreciated traditional family values the lgl association underlined that a criminal offence could not be justified by the views and traditions of either an individual or the majority of society in that connection the lgl association also relied on the court s case-law which held that freedom of expression was applicable not only to information or ideas that were favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also those that offended shocked or disturbed the lgl association lastly referred to the court s judgment in balsytė-lideikienė v. lithuania no november to the effect that one right such as the freedom of speech of the authors of the comments could be restricted if such a restriction was necessary because that speech was offensive by a final ruling of february the klaipėda regional court dismissed the lgl association s appeal upholding the prosecutor s and the district court s reasoning including that court s arguments regarding the applicants eccentric behaviour the regional court also underlined the fact that the first applicant had posted the photograph in question publicly and had not restricted it to his friends or like-minded people bendraminčiams even though the facebook social network allowed such a possibility such an action could therefore be interpreted as constituting an attempt to deliberately tease or shock individuals with different views or to encourage the posting of negative comments the regional court also considered that in the absence of objective and subjective elements of a crime under article of the criminal code it would constitute a waste of time and resources or even an unlawful restriction of the rights of others that is to say internet commenters to open criminal proceedings lastly criminal proceedings constituted an ultima ratio measure and not all actions merited them in their application to the court the applicants stated that the proceedings before the domestic courts had generated a lot of interest in both the local and international media as a result they had experienced an increased level of attention and hostility both in the private and in the public space the first applicant had been summoned by his secondary-school headmaster who had requested him not to disseminate his ideas the second applicant had been summoned by the dean of the university theology faculty who had requested him to change his course of study because his lifestyle did not correspond with the faculty s values on several occasions the applicants had been verbally harassed in public places they had also received a number of threatening private messages in their social network mailboxes none of those incidents had been reported to the police because the applicants had been steadily losing their faith in the effectiveness of the law-enforcement system in lithuania in the light of their unsuccessful attempts to launch a pre-trial investigation in connection with the initial hateful comments for their part the government referred to a number of educational programmes at the first applicant s secondary school aimed at raising children s understanding of such issues as respect solidarity and non-discrimination they also could not speculate on the reasons for the second applicant changing his course of study the government lastly pointed out that the applicants themselves had never attempted to persuade the domestic authorities to initiate any kind of pre-trial investigation regarding any alleged subsequent discriminatory acts the constitution reads human dignity shall be protected by law it shall be prohibited to torture or injure a human being degrade his dignity subject him to

homophobic or religious hatred or on other grounds of a discriminatory nature usually attract quite a high degree of public awareness both within society and in the domestic and foreign media they i

ruling of september in a case regarding the compliance with the constitution of the seimas resolution on the approval of the state family policy concept which was related to the question whether only married persons and children born in such a union could be considered to constitute a family the constitutional court held in the context of the constitutional case at issue it needs to be noted that the constitutional concept of family may not be derived solely from the institution of marriage which is entrenched in the provisions of paragraph of article of the constitution the fact that the institutions of marriage and family are entrenched in the same article of the constitution indicates an inseparable and unquestionable relationship between marriage and family marriage is one of the foundations of the constitutional institution of the family and serves the purpose of the creation of family relations it is a historically established family model that undoubtedly has exceptional value in the life of society and which ensures the viability of the nation and the state as well as their historical survival however this does not mean that the constitution inter alia the provisions of paragraph of article thereof does not protect and defend families other than those founded on the basis of marriage inter alia the relationship between a man and a woman living together without having concluded a marriage which is based on the permanent bonds of emotional affection reciprocal understanding responsibility respect shared upbringing of children and similar bonds as well as on the voluntary determination to take on certain rights and responsibilities which form a basis for the constitutional institutions of motherhood fatherhood and childhood thus the constitutional concept of family is based on mutual responsibility between family members understanding emotional affection assistance and similar relations as well as on the voluntary determination to take on certain rights and responsibilities that is to say the content of the relationship whereas the form of expression of such relationships has no essential significance for the constitutional concept of family. more recently by a ruling of january in a case concerning the issuance of a temporary residence permit in lithuania to a foreign national in the event of family reunification and in response to a request for interpretation lodged by the supreme administrative court regarding the constitutionality of the law on the legal status of aliens the constitutional court held that a refusal to issue such a permit may not be based solely on the gender identity and/or sexual orientation of a foreign national as to the state s obligation to protect human dignity it held under paragraph of article of the constitution human dignity is protected by law paragraph of the same article establishes a prohibition inter alia on degrading human dignity when interpreting those constitutional provisions the constitutional court has held that dignity is an inalienable characteristic of a human being of the greatest social value every member of society has innate dignity all people by nature are to be deemed equal in their dignity and rights human dignity should be regarded as constituting a special constitutional value dignity is characteristic of every human being irrespective of how he/she assesses himself/herself or other people assess him/her the constitution establishes the state s duty to ensure the protection and defence of human dignity state institutions and officials have the duty to respect human dignity as a special value the constitutional court has held that private life is the personal life of an individual his or her way of life marital status relationships with other people views convictions or habits his/her physical or psychological state health honour dignity etc the inviolability of private life which is enshrined in the constitution gives rise to the right of a person to privacy which includes the physical and psychological inviolability of a person his/her honour and reputation the provision of paragraph of article of the constitution is one of the most important guarantees of the inviolability of an individual s private life the private life of an individual is protected from unlawful interference by the state other institutions their officials and other persons this provision enshrines one of the aspects of the family concept confirming the constitutional significance of the family as a protected and fostered constitutional value if the private life of an individual is interfered with in an arbitrary and unlawful manner then at the same time his/her honour and dignity are encroached upon the protection of human dignity is inseparable from the protection of the private life of a person the constitutional court has held that discrimination is most often understood as a restriction of the rights of an individual on the basis of gender race nationality language origin social status belief convictions views or other characteristics it should be noted that one of the forms of discrimination prohibited under article of the constitution is the restriction of the rights of a person on the grounds of his/her gender identity and/or sexual orientation such a restriction should also be regarded as degrading human dignity o nly a state that has respect for the dignity of every human being can be considered to be truly democratic it should be emphasised that as noted by the constitutional court the constitution is an anti-majoritarian act which protects an individual in view of this fact it should be noted that in a democratic state operating under the rule of law the attitudes or stereotypes prevailing over a certain period of time among the majority of members of society may not on the basis of the constitutionally important objectives inter alia ensuring public order or public policy serve as constitutionally justifiable grounds for discriminating against persons solely on the basis of their gender identity and/or sexual orientation or for limiting the right as guaranteed under paragraphs and of article of the constitution to the protection of private and family life or the protection of relationships with other family members the constitutional court has noted on more than one occasion that the constitutional principle of the equality of persons which is enshrined in article of the constitution should be followed both in passing and applying laws. regarding the concepts of family and marriage the constitutional court extrapolated in its ruling of september the constitutional court held that the constitutional concept of the family may not be derived solely from the institution of marriage as enshrined in paragraph of article of the constitution see also paragraph above the duty stemming from paragraph of article of the constitution for the state to establish by means of laws and other legal acts a legal regulation that would ensure the protection of the family as a constitutional value implies the obligation of the state not only to establish such a legal regulation that inter alia would create the preconditions for the proper functioning of families strengthen family relationships and defend the rights and legitimate interests of family members but also to regulate by means of laws and other legal acts family relationships in such a way that no preconditions would be created in respect of discrimination against certain participants in family relationships such as against a man and a woman who live together without having registered their union as a marriage their children/adopted children or single parents raising their child/adopted child in this context it should be noted that paragraph of article of the constitution enshrines the constitutional concept of marriage concluded by the free mutual consent of a man and a woman it should be emphasised that a different concept of marriage may not be enshrined under the laws of the republic of lithuania unless paragraph of article of the constitution is amended accordingly the constitutional court has noted that marriage is one of the grounds for the constitutional institution of the family for the purpose of the creation of family relationships it is a historically established family model that has undoubtedly been of exceptional value in the life of society and ensures the viability of the nation and the state as well as their historical survival it should be noted that unlike the constitutional concept of marriage the constitutional concept of the family among other things is neutral in terms of gender under paragraphs and of article of the constitution interpreted in conjunction with the principle of the equality of persons and the prohibition of discrimination as established in article of the constitution the constitution protects and defends all families that meet the constitutional concept of the family which is based on permanent or long-lasting relationships between family members i.e reciprocal understanding and responsibility emotional affection and help and similar bonds as well as on the voluntary determination to take on certain rights and duties references to earlier rulings of the constitutional court omitted in this ruling the constitutional court made numerous references to the case-law of the court of justice of the european union hereinafter referred to as the cjeu including the june judgment in case also see paragraph below the constitutional court also extensively relied on the case-law of the court on june the constitutional court examined the compliance of certain provisions of the law on education with the constitution it held the freedom of convictions and their expression establishes ideological cultural and political pluralism no views or ideology may be declared mandatory and thrust on an individual i.e the person who freely forms and expresses his own views and who is a member of an open democratic and civil society this is an innate human freedom the state must be neutral in matters of convictions it does not have any right to establish a mandatory system of views paragraph of article of the constitution establishes the principle of the absence of a state religion in lithuania this constitutional norm and the norm providing that there are traditional churches and religious organisations in lithuania mean that the tradition of religion should not be identified with its belonging to the state system churches and religious organisations do not interfere with the activity of the state its institutions and that of its officials they do not form state policy while the state does not interfere with the internal affairs of churches and religious organisations they function freely according to their canons and statutes construing the norm set down in paragraph of article of the constitution that there shall not be a state religion in lithuania that of paragraph of the same article that churches and religious organisations shall function freely according to their canons and statutes that of paragraph of article that state and municipal establishments of teaching and education shall be secular as well as other constitutional provisions in a systemic manner the conclusion should be drawn that the principle of the separateness of the state and the church is established in the constitution the principle of the separateness of the state and the church is the basis of the secularity of the state of lithuania its institutions and their activities this principle along with the freedom of convictions thought religion and conscience which is established in the constitution together with the constitutional principle of equality of all persons and the other constitutional provisions determine neutrality of the state in matters of world view and religion. on december the supreme court delivered a ruling in criminal case no the proceedings concerned the conviction of j.j. under article of the criminal code and her acquittal under article those verdicts had been reached by trial and appellate courts j.j. was found guilty of having posted on the internet site of a daily newspaper underneath an article entitled young people protesting in front of the seimas have not captured parliamentarians attention prie seimo protestuojantys jaunuoliai nesulaukė parlamentarų dėmesio the following comment s ome people who empathise with such fags showing off are themselves the same kind of perverts and mentally ill people comments are being posted here also by participants in that public assembly of perverts shame on the organisers and participants of that assembly there is a word reprobate pasileidėlis that characterises the person who can not control his or her urges accordingly reprobates are in front of our eyes and not ordinary reprobates but reprobates of a special kind these are perverts iškrypėliai they should be urgently sent to a psychiatric hospital their place is there. the supreme court firstly noted that under article of the constitution everyone had the right to have his own convictions and to freely express them but that that freedom was incompatible with criminal actions including incitement to hatred violence and discrimination that principle was specified in more detail by article of the criminal code which mainly aimed at protecting the equality of persons but also at protecting their honour and dignity the supreme court also pointed out that for criminal liability under article to arise it was sufficient for the person concerned to publicly make negative degrading or demeaning neigiami niekinantys ar žeminantys statements towards one of the groups of persons defined in that provision or by inciting and urging skatindamas ir kurstydamas negative feelings hatred or discrimination in others in respect of that group of persons or a member thereof in that connection the crime was considered to have been committed once such statements were made nusikaltimo sudėtis formalioji and it was not relevant whether any consequences arose because of such statements pasekmių atsiradimas nėra svarbus as to the manner in which such a crime was committed a necessary constitutive element of such a criminal act the actions or statement in question had to be made publicly in addition the subjective element of a crime was that of direct intent tiesioginė tyčia regarding the facts of that particular case the supreme court considered that the trial and appellate courts had failed to take into account the context of the events which had prompted the comment in question namely they had overlooked the fact j.j. had been referring to an unauthorised event nesankcionuotas renginys that had taken place near the seimas accordingly for the supreme court the convicted person s negative reaction towards the unlawful event as such had constituted her natural civic position natūrali pilietiška pozicija in that connection one also had to bear in mind the provocative aspect of the event and the unlawful manner that is to say in the course of an unsanctioned public gathering in which the participants of that event had chosen to express their views pažiūros and ideas the supreme court held the unauthorised event near the house of the seimas and the eccentric behaviour of the participants truly did not contribute towards an understanding of others who had other points of view or towards building tolerance the participants in that event when using their right to freely express their beliefs and promote tolerance should have had regard to the fact that that freedom is inseparable from the obligation to respect the views and traditions pažiūros ir tradicijos of others this has a basis in article of the constitution which states that the family shall be the basis of society and the state and marriage shall be concluded upon the free mutual consent of a man and a woman under the legal regulation that today is in force in lithuania and the values protected by the constitution family as a value protected by the constitution is a union between a man and a woman the supreme court furthermore noted that j.j. had been found guilty under article of the criminal code of having publicly ridiculed viešai niekino persons of homosexual orientation by using the words perverts and reprobates the supreme court then pointed out that according to both the lithuanian language dictionary lietuvių kalbos žodynas and the contemporary lithuanian language dictionary dabartinės lietuvių kalbos žodynas a pervert was one who has a perversion was a degenerate išsigimėlis or a person who did not have a proper lifestyle netvarkingai gyvenąs žmogus a reprobate was a person who was naughty išdykęs fidgety nenuorama debauched palaidūnas or profligate ištvirkėlis the supreme court thus concluded that even though those words had negative and demeaning neigiama ir niekinama connotations in the lithuanian language the mere use of those words in the impugned comment without any concrete and direct statement inciting hatred or discrimination towards this group of persons meant that there were no objective elements of a crime as listed in article of the criminal code the supreme court likewise considered that although j.j. s use of the terms pervert and reprobate to express her opinion of an unsanctioned public gathering of homosexual persons had not been ethical they had not been dangerous enough to render her criminally liable under article of the criminal code lastly the use of only two such unethical terms in the public space was not sufficient to establish the subjective element of a crime namely that of the direct intent to incite hatred or discrimination in internet users reading j.j. s comment against homosexual persons on march the supreme court delivered a ruling in criminal case no which concerned v.g. s conviction under article and of the criminal code by the trial court and his acquittal by the appellate court although the prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law arguing that v.g. s comment such broken-asses should be given some trimming duot į kailį tokiems išdraskytašikniams underneath an article about gay persons rights posted on the internet portal of a major daily news website merited criminal liability the supreme court did not share that view it admitted that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was just as perilous as discrimination on the basis of race or colour of skin moreover comments on the internet in the event that they instigated hatred or violence were dangerous given the fact that persons could be inclined to write such comments because of the protection that anonymity afforded them and the fact that because of the nature of the internet such comments could be read by a large number of persons especially when such comments were published on one of the most popular websites as was the situation in that case the supreme court also pointed out that the topic of sexual minorities rights in lithuania was pertinent tema aktuali and was surrounded by a certain social tension that was linked among other things to a rather conservative or negative attitude on the part of part of society towards sexual minorities that being so the comment at issue in those criminal proceedings was not such as to merit limitations on freedom of expression and the application of the criminal law as an ultima ratio measure the supreme court acknowledged that v.g. s comment had been of a negative and demeaning nature and directed against homosexuals nevertheless even if the author of that comment had used his right to freedom of expression inappropriately such a comment could not have posed a real danger to the values protected by article of the criminal code that is to say it could not have breached homosexuals right of equality collectively or individually or their dignity the comment also could not have genuinely incited readers of the internet portal in question to commit violence against that group or individuals belonging to that group for the supreme court that conclusion stemmed from the fact that the comment in question had been laconic rather than specific that is to say the author had not further elaborated on his views in order to incite others against the group of persons in question and violence had been discussed only in an abstract manner and through the means of idiom the supreme court thus concluded that v.g. s actions had lacked both the objective and subjective elements of a crime and that he had therefore been correctly acquitted on march the supreme court delivered a ruling in criminal case no which concerned v.i. s conviction for having used the expression fucking nigger in respect of a person of colour the court noted that v.i had used that term on one occasion in a public space on the street in vilnius in an appeal on points of law v.i had pleaded that she had used the term negro the supreme court considered that the latter term if used in lithuania which had no history of slave labour segregation or social conflict on the basis of certain people belonging to another race and where the word negro therefore did not have a demeaning connotation could not have been considered as discriminatory on the basis of race this also stemmed from the fact that historically there were practically no persons of non-caucasian race living in lithuania the image of a negro in lithuanian culture was linked to that of a person who had been exploited and was hard-working and who therefore deserved compassion however the word nigger which came from the english language had a demeaning and vulgar connotation especially when used together with word fucking accordingly v.i had been correctly convicted under article of the criminal code on october the supreme court delivered a ruling in criminal case no upholding r.p. s conviction under article and of the criminal code for having posted a number of offensive and discriminatory comments in respect of persons of russian ethnicity underneath articles posted on a major internet news portal the supreme court referred to the court s judgments in mižigárová v. slovakia no december and nachova and others v. bulgaria gc nos and echr to the effect that discrimination on account of inter alia a person s ethnic origin was a form of racial discrimination a particularly invidious kind of discrimination that in view of its perilous consequences required from the authorities special vigilance and a vigorous reaction on january in criminal case no the vilnius regional court upheld the acquittal of ž.r. who had been on trial under article of the criminal code for having once shouted these bastards should go back to their homeland to israel during a public demonstration in vilnius although the prosecutor argued that that statement had been discriminatory towards the jewish people the appellate court found that the jewish nation had not been explicitly mentioned in that statement in the view of the court israel was the homeland not only of the jews but also of persons of other nationalities such as arabs furthermore a large number of jewish people lived in the united states of america and those people considered that country to be their homeland on may the klaipėda regional court in case no found v.m guilty under article of the criminal code and gave him a fine the case concerned a comment posted by v.m on the internet children should be educated not to become faggots and should they wish to become such they should be thrown out of home like trash vaikus reikia auklėti kad netaptų pederastais o jei užsimano juo būti reikia iš namų išmesti kaip kokią šiukšlę the court considered that although the comment had not called for violence against homosexuals it had clearly been degrading and discriminatory the court also emphasised that the comment posted on the internet had been public and accessible to a large number of people not only to one or several persons participating in a discussion on the internet moreover by placing such a comment in a public space viešojoje erdvėje the author had aimed at his opinion becoming known to other internet users and this was the manner in which his intent to commit the crime manifested itself in the appeal see paragraph above the lgl association relied on the following decisions of june and june by a final decision of june in criminal case no the kaunas district court found t.k guilty under article of the criminal code for having posted underneath an article on the internet site of a major newspaper the comment

his computer s ip address which had been provided by his internet service provider and criminal proceedings had been opened on the basis of a complaint lodged by a non-governmental organisation the tolerant youth association tolerantiško jaunimo asociacija the court also cited the conclusion reached by the inspector to the effect that the comment at issue had been intended to ridicule homosexuals on may in criminal case no the vilnius regional court found d.b.-l. guilty of inciting hatred against jews the court noted that d.b.-l. having received a university education and being mentally healthy understood the meaning of words such as juden raus lithuania for lithuanians and jews to the oven that she had posted in the comments sections underneath a number of articles on the internet website of a major daily newspaper the court confirmed that the crimes set out in article and were committed once the expression containing a hateful comment had been made the court also underlined that d.b.-l. had posted her so-called comments twelve times such acts can not be seen as accidental or imprudent atsitiktinės ar neapgalvotos that being so the court held that the

through online comments blogs social networks and other fora some of reported hate speech cases are occurring in this sphere human rights activists monitoring hate speech in lithuania noticed a trend towards creating web-pages hosted on us servers to post hate speech and attempt to circumvent lithuanian anti-hate speech legislation the sites are usually not restricted or shut down and remain available to be viewed also by lithuanian internet users homo- and transphobic hate speech is widespread on the internet in particular in online fora and in comments sections of news portals rather than the articles themselves online hate speech goes largely unchecked and unpunished the internet is also used to make threats of violence there have been several cases of threats against members of minorities such as poles and jews on numerous occasions threats of violence were also made against lgbt persons or groups especially through social networks as to measures taken by the lithuanian authorities the ecri report noted measures taken by the authorities ecri considers hate speech particularly worrying because it is often a first step in the process towards actual violence appropriate responses to hate speech include law enforcement channels criminal and administrative law sanctions civil law remedies but also other mechanisms to counter its harmful effects such as self-regulation prevention and counter speech the lithuanian authorities have taken various measures to combat hate speech but more needs to be done criminal law administrative law and civil law responses the prosecutor general s office reported that out of the thirty six pre-trial investigations under article of the criminal code on incitement against a national racial religious or other group carried out in cases were transferred to the courts persons were found guilty and sentenced in out of cases reported to the law enforcement authorities resulted in prosecution the woman who in had posted homophobic comments on a news website was convicted by the kaunas district court on march of incitement to hatred under article of the criminal code however on december the supreme court overturned the verdict and found that her words had been merely inappropriate but did not constitute incitement to hatred the supreme court was also of the opinion that the woman s homophobic comments were provoked by the nature of the pro-lgbt event in front of the seimas and the eccentric conduct of the protesters which violated the constitutionally protected traditional family values moreover the supreme court emphasised that in its view criminal prosecution of homophobic hate speech should only be a measure of last resort see paragraphs above in spite of the supreme court judgement mentioned above a vilnius district court in january found a person guilty of encouraging mockery defiance discrimination and physical violence against a group of people because of their sexual orientation and ordered him to pay a fine for having posted on facebook what we need is another hitler to exterminate those fags because there s just too many of them multiplying. ecri would like to point out to the lithuanian authorities that in a general climate of homo-/transphobia firm proportionate and appropriate actions including criminal prosecutions need to be taken to combat hate speech a number of threats of violent attacks have been investigated by the prosecutorial authorities but human rights defenders met by ecri s delegation criticise that some cases were dismissed by the courts on the basis that the threats did not appear sufficiently likely to be carried out training of law enforcement officials and members of the judiciary in judges and prosecutors were trained on legal and social aspects in the fight against discrimination furthermore the lithuanian authorities trained a total of police officers on the fight against racism and on promoting tolerance in general but have not yet carried out planned trainings for them on relevant provisions of the criminal code notably article which had been part of one of ecri s priority recommendations however the authorities informed ecri that an agreement between the ministry of interior and the office for democratic institutions and human rights odihr of the osce to provide assistance for such trainings was concluded ecri recommends that the authorities fully investigate racist and/or homo-/transphobic threats and ensure that a lack of probability does not constitute an obstacle for convicting a perpetrator furthermore the training programme for police officers on the fight against racism and promotion of tolerance should be expanded and the planned training sessions on relevant provisions of the criminal code be conducted ecri also recommends that the authorities carry out an evaluation of the impact the trainings had with a view to ensuring that further elements necessary to enable law enforcement officials and members of the judiciary to fight racist and homo-/transphobic hate speech including threats more effectively are identified and included in future training programmes monitoring and combatting online hate speech the previously existing special investigation division within the prosecutor general s office which also dealt with hate crime was dissolved in mainly due to lack of finance the functions of this division have been allocated to two specialised prosecutors in the prosecutor general s office and some prosecutors at district level the authorities also informed ecri s delegation that cybercrime investigation units have been established at district police headquarters these units are tasked to investigate criminal offences committed on the internet including racist and homophobic hate speech furthermore the cybercrime law came into effect on january and is the new legal basis for being able to close websites and internet fora in cases where criminal content is discovered lithuania also participated in the eu programme safer internet under which the inspector for journalist ethics monitors online content in texts were reviewed and in cases expert advice was sought most of the investigated texts were not found in the news sections themselves but in the readers comments sections the largest group concerned racist hate speech followed by anti-lgbt hate speech the inspector also organised eight training sessions for journalists in the ecri report then specifically tackled the issue of homophobic/transphobic violence homo-/transphobic violence all lgbt and human rights activists met by the ecri delegation agreed that homo- and transphobic violence is a growing problem in lithuania there is however no full official data on such acts according to lgbt representatives this is mainly due to a fear of revealing one s lgbt identity and lack of trust in the willingness of the police to investigate such crimes according to the eu lgbt survey of the respondents in lithuania said they were physically/sexually attacked or threatened with violence but only reported incidents of hate-motivated violence to the police a monitoring report prepared by a local ngo reveals nine instances of violence against lgbt persons that occurred between january and november including one case of extreme physical violence four cases of assault and four cases of damage against property the authorities on the other hand did not record any cases for the scale of the problem is also underestimated because of lack of awareness among police officers of the importance to register homo-/transphobic motivations as such an example is the case of a young man who was beaten up in a bar in vilnius after having been approached by the perpetrator with the words ‘ are you gay when he reported the case the police were unwilling to record it as a homophobic attack and in the course of collecting testimony from the victim an investigator allegedly implied that he had been attacked because he provoked the perpetrator with unwanted advances of a sexual nature fear of living openly with one s lgbt identity increases further as a result of violent attacks against public figures who do so in particular if the bias-motivation is not formally acknowledged and the perpetrators are not apprehended and convicted on july for example an explosive device was thrown at the openly homosexual singer r.k. during a concert in the village of linksmakalnis this was not the first attack against the singer in february eggs were thrown at him during a concert hitting him in the face see also in fine above in early july the partner of a transsexual artist was severely beaten by two attackers who also burned his face they used homophobic insults prior to the attack. as to measures taken by the lithuanian authorities to combat hate crimes the ecri report specifically noted measures taken by the authorities according to the osce/odhir hate crime statistics two cases were prosecuted per year in and these six court cases with five convictions achieved cover of the cases recorded by the police during this period the authorities report that within the framework of the inter-institutional action plan on the promotion of anti-discrimination for training courses were organised for police officers prosecutors and judges on racist and homo-/transphobic violence although an evaluation of these trainings is not available there seems to be a growing trend to investigate incidents of racist violence more effectively including attacks against property in a case of vandalism against a synagogue for example the perpetrator was speedily identified prosecuted and sentenced to payment of a fine the same can not be said however for homo-/transphobic acts of violence the police service has an internal complaints mechanism which also deals with complaints made by persons alleging to be victims of acts of racist and/or homo-/transphobic violence by police officers there is however no independent specialised police complaints mechanism which could be approached by individuals whose lack of trust in the police service prevents them from lodging a complaint ecri recommends further training for police officers prosecutors and judges on how to deal with racist and in particular homo-/transphobic acts of violence this should include improved procedures for recognising bias-motivations as well as confidence-building measures between the police and minority representatives and lgbt groups ecri also recommends the creation of an independent police complaints service that will be tasked to investigate inter alia allegations of racist and/or homo-/transphobic violence committed by law enforcement officials. as to other topics specific to lithuania including legislation on the protection of minors against harmful impact and the position taken by the inspector the ecri report also noted legislation restrictions of public information and awareness-raising current legislation limits some types of public activities of lgbt persons the law on the protection of minors against the detrimental effect of public information bans ‘ public defiance of family values which includes public information which ‘ expresses contempt for family values or encourages the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than that stipulated in the constitution of the republic of lithuania and the civil code of the republic of lithuania which defines marriage as between a man and a woman this law has been applied on several occasions recently in may following complaints from the lithuanian parents forum and a group of conservative mps to the ministry of culture and the lithuanian university of educational sciences leu the children s book gintarinė širdis amber heart by author n.d. which had been published six months previously by the leu was withdrawn from bookshops the book contains fairy tales featuring members of socially vulnerable groups such as same-sex couples roma and disabled people and aims at promoting tolerance and respect for diversity among children following the complaints the leu explained the withdrawal of the book by suddenly describing it as ‘ harmful primitive and biased homosexual propaganda furthermore the office of the inspector of journalistic ethics concluded that two fairy tales that promote tolerance for same-sex couples are harmful to minors the inspectorate s experts deemed the stories in violation of the law on the protection of minors because they encourage ‘ the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the constitution of the republic of lithuania and the civil code of the republic of lithuania the experts also considered the stories to be ‘ harmful invasive direct and manipulative in september fearing a potential violation of the law on protection of minors lithuanian tv stations refused to broadcast a tv spot promoting tolerance towards lgbt people which had been prepared by an ngo for the campaign change it subsequently this decision was confirmed by the inspector of journalistic ethics on the grounds that the tv spot seemed to portray a same-sex family model in a positive light which the inspectorate considered to have a negative impact on minors and to be in violation of the law. most recently on june the ecri published conclusions on the implementation of the recommendations in respect of lithuania subject to interim follow-up in its report on lithuania fifth monitoring cycle ecri recommended that the lithuanian authorities as part of the inter-institutional action plan for on non-discrimination set up an inter-institutional working group to develop a comprehensive strategy to tackle effectively the problem of racist and homo-/transphobic hate speech this group should include the relevant authorities as well as civil society organisations including amongst others representatives of the lgbt community in november the lithuanian ministry of interior created a working group on hate crime monitoring analysis and evaluation ecri has been informed by the authorities that this working group consists of experts from the ministry of interior including the ministry s information technology and communications department the police department the criminal police bureau the prosecutor s office the government department for national minorities the law institute and civil society organisations including the human rights monitoring institute the lithuanian centre for human rights and representatives of the jewish community and the lgbt community the group met twice in and no meetings took place in and uncertainties remain as to the agreed tasks of the working group some activities however continued on march a seminar took place organised by the osce/odihr and the eu-fra jointly with the ministry of interior for civil society members of the working group on improving monitoring of hate crime and the collection of related data in lithuania in line with international standards ecri was also informed that the prosecutor s office the office of the inspector for journalist ethics and the ministry of interior started the implementation of a joint project entitled ‘ strengthening responses to hate crimes and hate speech in lithuania the project aims to ensure effective investigations prosecutions and adequate sentencing in hate crime cases raise awareness among national authorities about the impact of hate crime and hate speech understand the needs of vulnerable communities address the problem of under-reporting and intensify efforts to counter on-line hate speech furthermore in police officers took part in the osce/odihr s ‘ training against hate crimes for law enforcement tahcle programme and in the police commissioner general ordered the training of some law enforcement officers on hate crime issues at the lithuanian police school and its partner institutions such training for police officers is implementing measures foreseen in the action plan for the promotion of non-discrimination while ecri recognises the positive intentions contained in the action plan its overall level of coordination does not appear to be well developed which is also highlighted by the fact that the action plan was adopted by only one ministry namely the ministry of social security and labour and shows no evidence of being based on an integrated interagency strategy in spite of some useful steps taken by the authorities ecri concludes that the various measures do not yet constitute a comprehensive strategic approach to effectively tackle the problem of racist and homo-/transphobic hate speech the inter-institutional working group has also not arrived at developing such a strategy ecri encourages the lithuanian authorities to continue and scale up its efforts to prevent and combat hate speech and hate crime and to overcome fragmentation by making effective use of the existing working group ecri considers that this recommendation has been partially implemented. on april the european union fundamental rights agency launched online a study entitled the european union survey of discrimination and victimisation of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons the results showed that in lithuania of lithuanian lgbt respondents had felt discriminated against or harassed on the grounds of their sexual orientation within the previous twelve months the highest proportion in the eu where the overall average stood at furthermore of lithuanian respondents had felt discriminated against while at work within the previous twelve months the second highest number in the eu where the overall average stood at the average number of violent incidents against lgbt people in lithuania was per respondents again the highest proportion in the eu on the october the european commission ec published the results of the eurobarometer survey discrimination in the eu in respondents from the european union eu including respondents from lithuania took part in the survey that was conducted from may to june lithuanian respondents indicated that the most widespread forms of discrimination are on the grounds of sexual orientation age and gender identity of all lithuanian respondents stated that gay lesbian and bisexual people should not necessarily have the same rights as heterosexual people eu average was of lithuanians who participated in the study would not support same-sex marriages being legalized throughout europe eu average was would feel uncomfortable about having an lgb person in the highest elected political position eu average was of lithuanians would feel uncomfortable about having an lgb person as one of their colleagues at work eu average was disapproved of sexual relationships between two persons of the same sex eu average was of lithuanians do not agree that curriculum and material at school should include information about diversity in terms of sexual orientation eu average was on november in joined cases to the court of justice of the european union hereinafter the cjeu when interpreting directive in connection with questions concerning minimum standards relating to the conditions for the granting of refugee status or subsidiary protection status including membership of a particular social group held when assessing an application for refugee status the competent authorities can not reasonably expect in order to avoid the risk of persecution the applicant for asylum to conceal his homosexuality in his country of origin or to exercise reserve in the expression of his sexual orientation. on june in case the grand chamber of the cjeu delivered a preliminary ruling holding that in a situation in which a union citizen has made use of his freedom of movement by moving to and taking up genuine residence in a member state other than that of which he is a national and whilst there has created or strengthened a family life with a third-country national of the same sex to whom he is joined by a marriage lawfully concluded in the host member state article of the treaty on the functioning of the european union providing the union citizens right to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states must be interpreted as precluding the competent authorities of the member state of which the union citizen is a national from refusing to grant that third-country national a right of residence in the territory of that member state on the ground that the law of that member state does not recognise marriage between persons of the same sex,case originated application republic lithuania lodged court

daughters as regards the alleged threats it was considered that the applicant had failed to prove her accusations the prosecutor concluded that although n.c. had committed the crime of bodily harm his actions had not created any danger to society because he had been provoked by the victim had no previous criminal record and was a retired person pensionar the applicant s complaint against that decision was rejected as illfounded on march by the superior prosecutor on april the applicant lodged a complaint against the prosecutors decisions of december and march with the petroşani district court asking that n.c. be charged with bodily harm be convicted and ordered to pay non-pecuniary damages for the suffering she had endured she alleged that the administrative fine which n.c. had refused to pay had not had a deterrent effect on him as he had continued to assault her after the prosecutor s decision of december she also asked the court to impose criminal sanctions on him and

hearing before the petrosani district court the applicant applied to be given a court-appointed lawyer because she did not have the financial means to hire one the court dismissed the application holding that the subject matter of the case did not require representation by a lawyer by an interlocutory judgment of june the petrosani district court decided to partially quash the prosecutor s decision of december in respect of the crime of bodily harm and the penalty imposed for it and to examine that part of the case on the merits the prosecutor s findings in respect of the threats were upheld the recording was not admitted as evidence because the court considered that it had no relevance to the case the applicant and n.c. gave statements before the court n.c. explained that on september the applicant had been drunk and had threatened him with a knife in order to defend himself he had pushed her but he denied having ever hit the applicant on february the court heard a statement from the applicant s daughter c.b.a. who testified as follows on february the petroşani district court decided to acquit n.c. of the crime of bodily harm the court considered that c.b.a. s statement could not be taken into consideration without mentioning any reasons for that decision the court concluded as follows the court further dismissed the applicant s claims for damages as the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law recurs against that judgment she alleged among other arguments that n.c. was a violent person who continued to assault her even after being punished with an administrative fine by the prosecutor on december on may the hunedoara county court dismissed as illfounded the applicant s appeal on points of law and upheld the decision of february the court held that the acts of violence committed by n.c. had been provoked by the applicant and had therefore not reached the level of severity required for them to fall within the scope of the crime of bodily harm for the same reason an award for damages was not justified between february and april the applicant made five complaints to the petroşani police concerning new incidents of assault or threats by n.c. to which she attached medical reports in the meantime on march the applicant asked the hunedoara county police to apply the measures provided by law in order to stop the constant assaults she was being subjected to by n.c. she stressed that she felt that her life was in danger a similar request was sent by the applicant to the police on april on september the prosecutor s office attached to the petroşani district court decided not to press charges against n.c. for the five incidents described by the applicant he was however punished with an administrative fine of ron approximately eur the applicant s letter of march requesting the police to take the necessary measures in order to stop the constant assaults against her was not taken into consideration the prosecutor found that it could not be considered a formal complaint because unlike the other complaints it did not refer to a specific assault the applicant did not lodge any further complaints against the above-mentioned decision the relevant provisions of the romanian criminal code in force at the time are as follows administrative sanctions bodily harm threats law no on preventing and combating domestic violence

cases see below also took part according to an affidavit sworn by the applicant before the trnc nicosia district court on august the demonstration of july was peaceful and was held on the fifteenth anniversary of the turkish intervention in in support of the missing persons and to protest against human-rights violations the applicant heard about the demonstration from the local radio and press during the afternoon of july the radio announced that turkish soldiers and policemen had started to cruelly beat the demonstrators the applicant a nursing officer decided to go to the area where the events were taking place he took with him a special bag containing first-aid equipment and wore an armband marked with the red cross sign the applicant told un officers that he was a nurse and they informed him that they needed his help for a woman who had received an injury to the head and was lying on the ground while he was trying to attend to the woman the applicant was beaten with clubs about the head and body by turkish military personnel and/or other personnel acting under turkish control despite his attempts to explain that he was a nurse they continued to hit him he felt a powerful blow to the head and started bleeding he was led away at gunpoint through an angry crowd that shouted abuse and threats and was then taken by bus to the so-called pavlides garage the crowd had encircled the bus and was hitting it with sticks and throwing stones at the arrested persons at the garage a body search was carried out and all the applicant 's personal effects were taken the crowd was shouting and throwing stones at the garage some of which came through the roof some hours later he was taken to hospital where he had stitches to his head he was then taken back to the garage he was still bleeding and his clothes were soaked with blood sometime after midnight he was interrogated by a greek-speaking officer the applicant declared that he had joined the demonstration voluntarily for humanitarian reasons he was told to sign a statement in turkish but refused as he did not understand turkish and signing would have been tantamount to recognising the turkish republic of northern the trnc in the morning of july he was taken to seray police station and put in a cell that was dark damp and dirty while at the station he was beaten and threatened on july he was given back his personal effects and taken to court where an interpreter explained the charges to the accused the applicant understood that he was accused of having violated the borders of the trnc he informed the judge that he had attended the demonstration only in order to offer humanitarian aid as a member of the red cross the court remained completely indifferent to what he said he was remanded in custody for two days and then taken to ortakeuy prison where all his personal effects were taken away again he was blindfolded and led to another area of the prison where he was interrogated and punched the interrogation was aimed solely at eliciting military information and the applicant lied about certain details he was forced to wash the blood from his clothes before appearing in court the next day after the interrogation he was taken to the central prison on july he was taken to court foreign journalists and un officers were present in the courtroom the accused had no legal representation and the quality of the interpretation was poor the applicant felt that the interpreter was not translating all of what was being said one of the accused the bishop of kitium spoke on behalf of the others and said that they would agree to be defended only by a greek-cypriot or un lawyer the judge replied that she could only appoint a lawyer registered with the trnc bar association the accused pleaded not guilty and stated that they did not recognise the legitimacy of the trnc or its tribunals four witnesses were called by the prosecution the bishop of kitium put some questions to the first witness however the judge refused to allow some of the questions and the bishop accordingly declined to cross-examine any other witness the prosecution witnesses lied about basic facts surrounding the demonstration and the arrest of the accused one of the persons present in the courtroom spoke briefly to the bishop who became frightened as a result after the trial the applicant and his co-accused were taken back to prison their pictures were taken on july the applicant was again taken to court a hostile crowd gathered outside the courtroom the applicant was sentenced to three days imprisonment and a fine of pounds cyp approximately euros eur with five additional days in prison in default of payment within hours this decision was translated into greek and the accused stated that they would not pay the fine an angry crowd had assembled within the precinct of the court and was shouting swearing and making obscene gestures at the accused the applicant had the impression that the crowd 's presence and actions were being orchestrated and controlled by the police from until july the applicant went on a hunger strike to protest about the prison director 's refusal to give the bishop of kitium church vestments and holy vessels with which to celebrate mass he was put in an isolation cell as punishment but continued his strike notwithstanding the pressure exerted by the prison staff on july the applicant was released and taken back to southern on july he went to the police headquarters in and made a complaint about his arrest and ill-treatment he was referred to where he was examined by a doctor in support of his claim of ill-treatment the applicant produced a medical certificate issued on july by dr a. hadjihannas a medical officer at this document reads as follows i have examined today costas stratis and found a head injury left frontal bone four stitches b.p removal of stitches and cleaning of wound was recommended he complains about mild pain in the epigastrium and nausea treatment was provided and urine culture was recommended for old nephritis. the government alleged that the applicant had participated in a violent demonstration with the aim of inflaming anti-turkish sentiment the demonstrators supported by the greek-cypriot administration were demanding that the green line in should be dismantled some carried greek flags clubs knives and wire-cutters they were acting in a provocative manner and shouting abuse the demonstrators were warned in greek and english that unless they dispersed they would be arrested in accordance with the laws of the trnc the applicant was arrested by the turkish-cypriot police after crossing the un buffer zone and entering the area under turkish-cypriot control the turkish-cypriot police intervened in the face of the manifest inability of the greek-cypriot authorities and the un force in to contain the incursion and its possible consequences no force was used against demonstrators who did not intrude into the trnc border area and in the case of demonstrators who were arrested for violating the border no more force was used than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances in order to arrest and detain the persons concerned no one was ill-treated it was possible that some of the demonstrators had hurt themselves in the confusion or in attempting to scale barbed wire or other fencing had the turkish police or anyone else assaulted or beaten any of the demonstrators the un secretary general would no doubt have referred to this in his report to the security council the applicant was charged tried found guilty and sentenced to a short term of imprisonment he pleaded not guilty but did not give evidence and declined to use the available judicial remedies he was asked if he required assistance from a lawyer registered in the trnc but refused and did not ask for legal representation interpretation services were provided at the trial by qualified interpreters all the proceedings were translated into greek in his report of december on the un operations in the un secretary general stated inter alia a serious situation however arose in july as a result of a demonstration by greek cypriots in the details are as follows a in the evening of july some greek cypriot demonstrators mostly women forced their way into the un buffer zone in the ayios kassianos area of the demonstrators broke through a wire barrier maintained by unficyp and destroyed an unficyp observation post they then broke through the line formed by unficyp soldiers and entered a former school complex where unficyp reinforcements regrouped to prevent them from proceeding further a short while later turkish-cypriot police and security forces elements forced their way into the area and apprehended persons of them women b the ayios kassianos school complex is situated in the un buffer zone however the turkish forces claim it to be on their side of the cease-fire line under working arrangements with unficyp the turkish-cypriot security forces have patrolled the school grounds for several years within specific restrictions this patrolling ceased altogether as part of the unmanning agreement implemented last may c in the afternoon of july some greek cypriots gathered at the main entrance to the un protected area in in which the un headquarters is located to protest the continuing detention by the turkish-cypriot authorities of those apprehended at ayios kassianos the demonstrators whose number fluctuated between and blocked all un traffic through this entrance until july when the turkish-cypriot authorities released the last two detainees d the events described above created considerable tension in the island and intensive efforts were made both at the un headquarters and at to contain and resolve the situation on july i expressed my concern at the events that have taken place and stressed that it was vital that all parties keep in mind the purpose of the un buffer zone as well as their responsibility to ensure that that area was not violated i also urged the turkish-cypriot authorities to release without delay all those who had been detained on july the president of the security council announced that he had conveyed to the representatives of all the parties on behalf of the members of the council the council 's deep concern at the tense situation created by the incidents of july he also stressed the need strictly to respect the un buffer zone and appealed for the immediate release of all persons still detained he asked all concerned to show maximum restraint and to take urgent steps that would bring about a relaxation of tension and contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favourable to the negotiations. the applicant produced photographs taken at different times during the demonstration on july photographs to were intended to show that notwithstanding the deployment of the turkish-cypriot police the demonstration was peaceful in photographs to members of the turkish-cypriot police are seen breaking up the unficyp cordon the final set of photographs show members of the turkish-cypriot police using force to arrest some of the demonstrators the english translation of the trnc nicosia district court 's judgment of july indicates that the applicant together with other men was charged with two offences entering trnc territory without permission contrary to sections and of law no see paragraph below and entering trnc territory other than through an approved port contrary to subsections and of the aliens and immigration law see paragraph below the judgment was given in the presence of the accused and of an interpreter the trial judge noted the following i the accused did not accept the charges against them and stated that they did not wish to use the services of a lawyer registered in the trnc ii the public prosecutor called five witnesses whose statements were translated into greek for the accuseds benefit iii the witnesses mainly police officers on duty at the time of the demonstration declared that the accused had illegally crossed the trnc border shouted abuse at the turkish-cypriot forces and resisted arrest by pulling and pushing knives and other cutting objects had been found in the bags of some of the demonstrators who had been arrested iv the accused had been told that they could cross-examine witnesses in turn and if they so wished choose one of their number to cross-examine the witnesses on behalf of all the accused during the hearing of evidence one of the accused put a few questions to one of the prosecution witnesses v the applicant had stated that he considered the cypriot coast to be the border and for that reason did not accept that he had violated the border before the district court gave its sentence the bishop of kitium speaking on behalf of all the accused had made a statement saying that their struggle had been peaceful that their aim was to have greek-cypriots and turkish-cypriots living together in peace that they had not been carrying weapons and that they had asked for un protection vi relying on statements by the prosecution witnesses which were not undermined by the statements made by some of the accused the district court came to the conclusion that the accused had crossed the borders of the trnc at an unapproved entry point and without permission and had resisted by various means the un and turkish forces which had tried to stop them vii the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt so that the accused were guilty on both counts viii in deciding on the sentence the district court had taken into account the seriousness of the offence and the fact that the accused had shown no remorse and continued to deny the validity of the trnc section of the cypriot criminal code reads as follows where five or more persons assemble with intent to commit an offence or being assembled with intent to carry out some common purpose conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace or will by such assembly needlessly and without any reasonable occasion provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace they are an unlawful assembly it is immaterial that the original assembly was lawful if being assembled they conduct themselves with a common purpose in such a manner as aforesaid when an unlawful assembly has begun to execute the purpose whether of a public or of a private nature for which it assembled by a breach of the peace and to the terror of the public the assembly is called a riot and the persons assembled are said to be riotously assembled. according to section of the criminal code any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to imprisonment for one year section of the criminal code provides any person who carries in public without lawful occasion any offensive arm or weapon in such a manner as to cause terror to any person is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for two years and his arms or weapons shall be forfeited. according to section of the criminal code it is an offence to carry a knife outside the home the relevant part of chapter section of the criminal procedure law states any officer may without warrant arrest any person b who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment c who obstructs a police officer while in the execution of his duty section of law no states any person who enters a prohibited military area without authorization or by stealth or fraudulently shall be tried by a military court in accordance with the military offences act those found guilty shall be punished. subsections and of the aliens and immigration law read as follows no person shall enter or leave the colony except through an approved port any person who contravenes or fails to observe any

their replies to a question asked by the court at the court 's request they produced various documents on june august and august however the court refused to admit to the file on the ground of their late submission further observations by the applicant received at the registry on july mr cevat gaygusuz a turkish national born in lived in hörsching upper austria from until september since then he has been living in izmir the applicant worked in with interruptions from until october from then until july periods when he was unemployed alternated with periods when he was certified unfit for work for medical reasons and he was in receipt of the corresponding benefits from july to march he received an advance on his retirement pension in the form of unemployment benefit when his entitlement expired he applied to the linz employment agency arbeitsamt on july for an advance on his pension in the form of emergency assistance antrag auf gewährung eines pensionsvorschusses in form der notstandshilfe on july the agency rejected the application on the ground that the applicant did not have austrian nationality which was one of the conditions laid down in section a of the unemployment insurance act arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz see paragraph below for entitlement to an allowance of that type mr gaygusuz appealed against the above decision to the upper austria regional employment agency landesarbeitsamt he argued in particular that the distinction drawn by the section in question between austrian citizens and foreign nationals was unjustified unconstitutional and contrary to the european convention on human rights on september the regional employment agency found against the applicant and upheld the impugned decision it emphasised that not only did he not have austrian nationality but in addition his case did not fall into any of the categories where exemption from that condition was provided for see paragraph below on november the applicant applied to the verfassungsgerichtshof alleging a violation of article of the basic law staatsgrundgesetz articles para and of the convention art art and article of protocol no on february after considering the application in camera the constitutional court declined to accept the case for adjudication article para of the federal constitution see paragraph below giving judgment in the following terms the applicant alleged the breach of rights guaranteed by the constitution in accordance with article para art of the european convention on human rights article of the basic law and article of protocol no to the convention and article of the convention art regard being had to the constitutional court 's established case-law relating to these rights the application is so unpersuasive as to the existence of the alleged violations or the infringement of any other right guaranteed by the constitution or the infringement of another right through the application of an unlawful general provision that with regard to the alleged violations to be considered by the constitutional court it does not have sufficient prospects of success in addition the case is not excluded from the jurisdiction of the verwaltungsgerichtshof the constitutional court therefore referred the case to the article para of the federal constitution see paragraph below on may the asked mr gaygusuz to expand on his application on july the applicant did so complaining of an infringement of his legal right to obtain an advance on his pension in the form of emergency assistance in accordance with the relevant provisions of the unemployment insurance act he requested the administrative court to set aside the decision of the upper austria regional employment agency of september as unlawful by reason of its content section i of the administrative court act verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz see paragraph below and to suspend the proceedings and refer the case to the constitutional court for consideration of the constitutionality of section a of the unemployment insurance act on september the administrative court sitting in camera ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with such an application and rejected it section of the administrative court act see paragraph below it noted that the application as expanded by mr gaygusuz referred solely to the constitutionality of section a of the unemployment insurance act it further noted that the applicant had asked the administrative court to refer the case to the constitutional court for consideration of the constitutionality of a statute but ruled that it was established that such questions came under the jurisdiction of the constitutional court article para first paragraph of the federal constitution see paragraph below which moreover had already ruled on the issue in the version which was applicable at the material time the relevant provisions of the unemployment insurance act arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz were worded as follows section unemployed persons who have applied for an invalidity insurance benefit may receive an advance in the form of unemployment benefit or emergency assistance provided that in addition

after consulting the organisations representing employers and employees exclude those categories or regions from entitlement to emergency assistance the federal minister of social affairs may authorise the grant of emergency assistance to unemployed persons who are nationals of another state where that state has a benefit equivalent to austrian emergency assistance which is payable to austrian citizens in the same manner as to its own nationals the federal minister of social affairs may after consulting the organisations representing employers and employees authorise the grant of emergency assistance to unemployed persons who do not have austrian nationality and have not been granted assistance under paragraph on condition that during the five years preceding the date of the application for emergency assistance they have been employed in austria for not less than weeks with compulsory payment of unemployment insurance contributions in order to calculate this period of five years no account shall be taken of periods when the person concerned was in receipt of unemployment benefit or emergency assistance authorisation may be given for a specific period and in respect of specific categories of unemployed persons emergency assistance is assistance paid to persons who are no longer entitled to unemployment benefit in order to guarantee them a minimum income

certificate within the meaning of the aliens employment act issued in the version in force at the time of issue persons who do not have austrian nationality but who at the time of their application for emergency assistance nevertheless satisfy the conditions for an exemption certificate and to whom such a certificate has not been issued on the sole ground that their occupation is not covered by

is not appropriate to adjudicate or which are manifestly barred as res judicata or for lack of the right to bring proceedings shall be rejected without further proceedings by a decision taken in closed sitting section of the administrative court act provides in so far as the administrative court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority 's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules section and it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward if it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on one of these complaints it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary section of the same act states that save as otherwise provided the administrative court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision by section the shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful by reason of its content or because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction or on account of a breach of procedural rules in that a the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are in an important respect contradicted by the case file or b the facts require further investigation on an important point or c procedural rules have been disregarded compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority if the administrative court quashes the impugned decision the administrative authorities

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on december and by the government of the swiss confederation the government on january within the three-month period laid down in article para and article art art of the convention it originated in an application no against lodged with the commission under article art by mrs susanna burghartz and mr albert burghartz on january the commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the government s application referred to articles and art art art the object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and art art of the convention in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of the rules of court the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent them rule whom the president gave leave to use the german language rule para the chamber to be constituted included ex officio mr l. wildhaber the elected judge of swiss nationality article of the convention art and mr r. ryssdal the president of the court rule para b on january in the presence of the registrar the president drew by lot the names of the other seven members namely mr thór vilhjálmsson mr f. gölcüklü mr l.-e. pettiti mr n. valticos mr i. foighel mr j.m morenilla and mr a.b baka article in fine of the convention and rule para of the rules of court art subsequently mr c. russo substitute judge replaced mr foighel who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case rules para and para as president of the chamber rule para mr ryssdal acting through the registrar consulted the agent of the government the applicants lawyer and the delegate of the commission on the organisation of the proceedings rules para and pursuant to the order made in consequence the registrar received the applicants and the government s memorials on june in accordance with the president s decision the hearing took place in public in the human rights building on august the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicants the court heard addresses by mr busuttil mr boillat and ms freivogel the applicants who are swiss nationals have both lived in basle since they were married in in and mrs burghartz has german citizenship also in accordance with german law article of the civil code they chose the wife s surname burghartz as their family name the husband availed himself of his right to put his own surname in front of that and thus call himself schnyder burghartz the swiss registry office zivilstandsamt having recorded schnyder as their joint surname the couple applied to substitute burghartz as the family surname and schnyder burghartz as the husband s surname on november the cantonal government regierungsrat of basle rural turned down the application on october the applicants made a further application to the cantonal department of justice justizdepartement of basle urban following an amendment to the civil code as regards the effects of marriage which had been made on october and had come into force on january see paragraph below on december their application was again refused on the ground that they had not pointed to any serious inconvenience arising from the use of the surname schnyder furthermore in the absence of any transitional provisions the new article para of the civil code could not apply to couples married before january lastly under the new article para only a wife could put her own surname before the family name see paragraph below the applicants then lodged an appeal berufung with the federal court bundesgericht in which they complained of among other things a breach of the new articles and para of the civil code and article para of the federal constitution see paragraphs and below on june the federal court allowed the appeal in part while refusing to apply paragraph of article which concerned only engaged couples and had no retrospective effect it held that in the particular case there were important factors which justified applying paragraph in order to allow the applicants to call themselves burghartz apart from the couple s age and profession account had to be taken of the differences between the relevant swiss and german systems which were made more acute by the fact that basle was a frontier city as to mr burghartz s application to be allowed to bear the name schnyder burghartz no support for it could be found in article para of the civil code the drafting history showed that the swiss parliament out of a concern to preserve family unity and avoid a break with tradition had never agreed to introduce absolute equality between spouses in the choice of name and had thus deliberately restricted to wives the right to add their own surnames to their husbands this rule therefore could not avail by analogy a husband in a family known by the wife s surname there was however nothing to prevent mr burghartz from using a double-barrelled name see paragraph below or even informally putting his surname before his wife s according to the applicant a large number of official documents in particular the certificate of his doctorate in history had not since then contained the schnyder element of his surname article para of the swiss federal constitution provides men and women shall have equal rights equality shall be provided for by law in particular in relation to the family education and work the relevant new civil code provisions that came into force on january read as follows article the government of the canton of residence may if there is good cause authorise a person to change his or her name engaged couples shall be authorised if they so request and if they prove a legitimate interest to bear the wife s surname as the family name once the marriage has been solemnised article married couples shall take the husband s surname as their family name a bride may however make a declaration to the registrar that she wishes to keep the surname she has borne to date followed by the family name article the children of married couples shall bear their family name article of the final section within one year of the entry into force of the new act a woman who was married under the old law may make a declaration to the registrar that she wishes to put the surname she bore before her marriage in front of the family name by a custom recognised in case-law married couples may also put the wife s surname after the husband s surname joining the two with a hyphen this double-barrelled name allianzname however is not regarded as the legal family name federal court judgment of may judgments of the swiss federal court vol ii mr and mrs burghartz applied to the commission on january relying on articles and art art of the convention the commission declared the application no admissible on february

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a lithuanian national ms ilona gineitienė the applicant on may the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by the applicant alleged in particular that the decision to place her two daughters with their father had been in breach of articles and of the convention on january the court decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the applicant was born in and lives in in the applicant married vg in the applicant became involved in the activities of the ojas meditation centre a lithuanian branch of a new religious movement called osho in she divorced her husband the permanent place of residence of the applicant 's two daughters ig and ag born in and respectively was not determined and they stayed with the applicant and her former husband in in july the applicant 's former husband brought an action requesting that his home be fixed as the place of residence of his daughters he alleged inter alia that the applicant 's involvement in the osho religious movement could have a negative influence on the children on july the kaunas district child rights protection agency having visited the father 's place of residence concluded that the living conditions were suitable and taking into consideration the wishes of ag and ig suggested fixing their place of residence with the father by a ruling of september the kaunas district court decided that pending the proceedings ag should reside with the applicant and ig should stay with her father on october the applicant and ag moved to settling in an apartment situated in the same building as the ojas headquarters the applicant was allowed to use that apartment free of charge ig stayed with her father on october the employees of the vilnius city child rights protection agency vaiko teisių apsaugos tarnyba visited the applicant 's residence they noted the applicant 's explanation that she had two rooms for her use one of them being reserved for ag when the applicant was absent a nanny would take care of her the living conditions seemed suitable for a child however during the interview ag explained that she wanted to stay with her father who took better care of her and did not leave her alone she elaborated that her mother left her alone during the day and that she often felt scared the agency then suggested fixing ag 's place of residence with her father on december the employees of the vilnius city child rights protection agency having visited the applicant 's place of residence in vilnius concluded that it was unsafe for ag to live there and that the applicant was not caring enough about ag 's upbringing and education they noted that the applicant 's living space consisted of one room and that the kitchen was shared with other residents of the house ag lived in that room with her mother both of them sleeping in the same bed the other room which was supposed to be part of the applicant 's living space was apparently also used by other persons at the time of the interview with ag two teenage boys entered the room without asking for permission according to ag her mother did not take care of her she did not have any friends and during the day was left alone the girl had to cook for herself she was not allowed to go to the adjoining yard and the building next to it where her mother was meditating the nanny would only come to take care of ag when the applicant left for a few days ag expressed her wish to live in with her father and sister ig the agency 's workers also interviewed ag 's kindergarten teachers according to them ag was often sad about not seeing her sister and father ag would also be picked up from the kindergarten by some fifteen year old girl but at the time of the interview she was going home on her own the agency 's workers suggested to the applicant that she find another place to live where ag would feel safer however the applicant refused because she did not have to pay rent for the current flat and it was close to her meditation centre on march the employees of the vilnius city child rights protection agency again interviewed ag who repeated her wish to live with her father the agency also noted that ag had stressed that she had made the same statement before the court of first instance and to the psychologists from june to july ag was examined by a psychologist again she expressed her wish to stay with her father and older sister on april the kaunas district court granted the action in part ruling that ig should live with the applicant 's former husband and ag should live with the applicant the court noted that both parents were well educated and had sufficient salaries to provide for their daughters in the course of the proceedings both girls had been heard by the court as well as by a psychologist they had both expressed their wish to stay with their father however the court agreed with one of the experts that ag then years old was not mature enough to take a reasonable decision about her parental preferences with respect to the applicant 's affiliation to the meditation centre the court noted the ministry of justice has refused to register ojas as a religious community suggesting that it should be registered as a non governmental organisation there is no indication in the case file that the meditation centre has a negative influence on children or that it propagates certain intolerable views nor is there any evidence that the applicant 's children are involved in the activities of the centre the court concludes that the applicant 's active participation in the activities of the meditation centre does not have any negative impact on her children in accordance with article of the constitution everyone is free to choose a religion or belief and to profess his religion to perform religious practices and to practise and teach his beliefs. on july the amended the decision ruling that both daughters should live with their father the court considered that too little weight had been afforded by the lower court to the express wish of ag to live with her father according to the appellate court this had not complied with article of the united nations convention on the rights of the child or the relevant provisions of national law which obliged the court to take into account a child 's wishes irrespective of its age the appellate court had regard to the expert 's conclusion of december that the environment in which the applicant lived was unsafe whereas the applicant 's husband was able to provide good living conditions for ag the recommendation by the kaunas district child rights protection agency to fix the place of residence of both daughters with the father was taken into account the court also observed the girls wish to stay together and to be close to other family members grandparents and friends living in certain instances of inadequate care were noted namely the applicant 's failure on one occasion to arrange for ag 's medical assistance or to ensure her attendance at school finally the appellate court observed that the first-instance court had not assessed nevertino the material submitted to the ministry of justice characterising the osho movement as controversial neither did the first-instance court give any credit to the fact that the movement had been unable to obtain registration as a religious community the applicant submitted a cassation appeal alleging inter alia that the court 's decision was discriminatory and that it had failed to respect her family life she requested that her youngest daughter ag live with her on december the supreme court dismissed the applicant 's cassation appeal it emphasised that the rights of both parents in the education of their children were equal regardless of their beliefs convictions or views the custody dispute was to be resolved taking into account the best interests of the children in which context their wishes should be considered regardless of their age in assessing the significance of such wishes the most important factor would be the children 's ability to formulate express and substantiate their views the supreme court established that ag had amply explained her preference to stay with her father during the entire proceedings both in her submissions to the courts and during the interviews with the experts she had stressed in particular that her mother had not taken adequate care of her often leaving her alone and neglecting to cook meals the girl had also expressed a preference for living in together with her sister and close to other relatives and friends she had noted that her father spent more time with her and took better care of her the supreme court emphasised that the experts had considered that the living conditions of the applicant were unsafe for children the supreme court further assessed the material conditions of accommodation offered by both parents it was established that the applicant 's husband was able to provide his daughters with a separate room in a private cottage in the countryside near the supreme court also emphasised the importance for the two sisters to be brought up together and underlined that close ties existed between them the applicant 's allegations of discrimination were dismissed as unsubstantiated in this respect the supreme court noted the applicant 's claim in her cassation appeal that the appellate court had breached the principle of non-discrimination enshrined in article of the convention as well as in lithuanian law by wrongly assessing the evidence on the ojas meditation centre and taking into account that the applicant belonged to it is unfounded when determining the place of residence of the two children whose parents live separately the court of appeal gave priority to the interests of the children took into account their wishes the ability and efforts of each parent to guarantee the basic rights of the children and each parent 's living conditions that is to say those conditions in which the children would have to live once their place of residence was decided the decision of the appellate court did not contain any indication that the resolution of the dispute was influenced by the fact that the applicant was a member of osho/ojas the appellate court only noted that the first-instance court had not assessed all the evidence regarding the meditation centre however that does not presuppose that the appellate court considered the applicant 's membership of the centre important in the resolution of the dispute had that been so such a consideration would require an assessment of whether the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion was observed in its judgments in the cases of hoffmann v. austria and palau-martinez v. france the european court of human rights ruled that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion enshrined in articles and of the convention had not been respected in cases where the courts had attached decisive importance to the applicant 's religious affiliation however when determining the custody dispute the appellate court did not attach significance to the fact that the applicant was a member of osho/ojas in an unrelated set of proceedings the ojas meditation centre requested a court order obliging the ministry of justice to register it as a religious community the action was granted by the on february the court found no evidence that ojas propagated any controversial practices amongst its members ojas was registered as a religious community on april article of the law on the fundamentals of protecting the rights of the child vaiko teisių apsaugos

the case originated in an application no against the hellenic republic lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a greek national mr i.b the applicant on december the president of the section acceded to the applicant s request not to have his name disclosed rule of the rules of court the applicant was represented by mr g. letsas and ms. v. mantouvalou lawyers practising in london the greek government the government were represented by the delegates of their agents ms g. papadaki adviser at the state legal council and ms m. germani legal assistant at the state legal council the applicant alleged in particular a violation of article of the convention taken in conjunction with article by a decision of august the chamber declared the application partly admissible the applicant and the government each filed further observations rule the applicant was born in and lives in athens the applicant had been working for a jewellery manufacturing company since on march he resigned from his post in order to carry out his military service afterwards he contacted s.k. the owner of the company who hired him again on a full-time basis from july on a monthly salary of euros eur in january the applicant told three of his colleagues i.m. s.m and o.g that he feared he had contracted the human immunodeficiency virus hiv on february while he was on annual leave that fear was confirmed by a test establishing that he was indeed hiv-positive on february his employer s.k. received a letter from the three above-mentioned employees in which they told her that the applicant had aids and that the company should dismiss him before the end of his annual leave all three colleagues had tested negative for aids in the meantime information about the applicant s health condition had spread throughout the entire company of seventy employees the staff started complaining to their employer about having to work with a colleague who was hiv-positive and demanded his dismissal s.k then invited an occupational-health doctor to come to the company premises and talk to the staff about hiv and how it could be transmitted the doctor attempted to reassure the staff by explaining the precautions to be taken but they continued to demand the applicant s dismissal s.k then considered transferring the applicant to another department at a different location but the head of that department threatened to resign if the applicant joined his team s.k then offered to help the applicant set up his own business if he would tender his resignation she also offered to pay for him to attend a training course in hairdressing the applicant refused her offers however on february thirty-three employees of the company approximately half the total number of staff sent a letter to s.k asking her to dismiss the applicant in order to preserve their health and their right to work failing which the harmonious atmosphere in the company would in their view be liable to deteriorate on february two days before the applicant returned from leave s.k dismissed him and paid him the statutory compensation due under greek law namely one month s salary and eur in respect of holiday leave shortly after his dismissal the applicant found another job in a private company on may the applicant brought proceedings in the athens court of first instance he complained that unacceptable social prejudices and outdated taboo considerations had prevailed over recognition of his contribution to the company where he had worked he also claimed that he had been unfairly dismissed and that his dismissal was invalid because he had not been paid sufficient compensation he alleged that he had been dismissed on the basis of despicable considerations which took no account of the human factor or his person that his employer had remained manifestly indifferent to the fact that she had thus seriously harmed a hard-working and conscientious employee at the very time when basic humane considerations required that he be supported and had at the same time callously insulted him and that his employer had treated him with an unjustified and inhumane aversion for his serious health problem the applicant added that the only reason that had led s.k to dismiss him had been scientifically unfounded prejudice against hiv-positive persons and the alleged risk that they posed in their professional and social relations it was therefore clear in the applicant s view that s.k. s conduct had brutally violated his personality rights in particular the most intimate ones concerning sensitive personal details the manner in which he had been dismissed had diminished unacceptably his value as a human being by reducing him to an object that could be handled according to personal prejudices and obsessions the applicant asked the court to declare the termination of the contract unlawful order the employer to continue employing him and paying him a salary and to pay him eur in unpaid salaries eur in holiday bonuses and various other amounts calculated by him and lastly the sum of eur for non-pecuniary damage in a judgment of june the court held that the dismissal was unlawful as contrary to article of the civil code which prohibited the exercise of a right if it manifestly exceeded the limits imposed by good faith or morals the court found that the sole ground for terminating the contract had been the applicant s illness and awarded him eur which corresponded to unpaid salaries since his dismissal the court considered that the employer s conduct even taking account of the pressure exerted by her employees had constituted an abuse of rights it found that the employer had decided to dismiss the applicant in order to ensure that her company continued operating smoothly and to avoid protests and complaints thus currying favour with the majority of her staff however the court rejected the applicant s complaint that his dismissal had violated his personality rights because it had not been established that the dismissal had been motivated by reprehensible intent or an intention to defame the applicant the court found however that s.k had dismissed the applicant in order to preserve what she had wrongly believed to be an issue of peaceful working relations within the company lastly the court held that it was not necessary to order the applicant s reinstatement because he had found a new job in the meantime on february and march respectively s.k and the applicant lodged an appeal against that judgment with the athens court of appeal in a judgment of january the court of appeal dismissed s.k. s appeal and upheld the applicant s appeal on both grounds namely abuse of rights and violation of personality rights like the court of first instance the court of appeal acknowledged that s.k had dismissed the applicant after giving in to pressure from staff and in order to preserve a good working environment in the company the court of appeal observed that the employees fears were scientifically unfounded as the occupational-health doctor had explained given the mode of transmission of the virus there was no danger to their health accordingly their fears were in reality based on prejudice rather than on an established risk consequently the applicant s illness could not affect the future smooth operation of the company the court of appeal weighed the need to maintain the smooth operation of the company which was threatened by scientifically unfounded fears against the applicant s justified expectation of being protected during the difficult period he was experiencing it noted that where an employee s illness did not adversely affect work relations or the smooth operation of the company through absenteeism or reduced working capacity for example it could not serve as an objective justification for terminating the contract it noted that the applicant had not been absent from work and that no absence on the ground of illness was foreseeable in the immediate future moreover the nature of the applicant s job which did not demand excessive effort precluded the risk of a reduction in his capacity for work since during the many years in which a person was merely hiv-positive his or her working capacity was not substantially reduced it observed that the applicant s illness could not adversely affect the future smooth operation of the company as none of the employees had left the company between the time when the applicant s illness had been revealed and the termination of his employment contract it concluded that the fact that s.k had given in to the demands of her employees dismissed the applicant and terminated his contract could not be justified on grounds of good faith or the employer s interests within the proper meaning of the term the court of appeal awarded the applicant the sum of eur in unpaid salaries backdated to the date of his dismissal it also held that the applicant s personality rights had been infringed as his unfair dismissal had affected both his professional and social status which were the two facets of an individual s personality it awarded him the further sum of eur for non-pecuniary damage under that head on july s.k appealed on points of law against the court of appeal s judgment on october the applicant also lodged an appeal against the court of appeal s judgment he relied on articles nullity of a legal act abuse of rights and compensation for non-pecuniary damage of the civil code on article right to work of the constitution and on the principle of proportionality regarding the amount of the compensation awarded relying on the case-law of the court of cassation he also submitted that where a dismissal had been set aside by a judicial decision as unfair the employer was under an obligation to reinstate the employee more specifically in his second ground of appeal the applicant submitted that the court of appeal had wrongly rejected his request to be reinstated in the company arguing that reinstatement was the rule in the event of a breach of article or in the event of an infringement of personality rights or of the right to personal development and participation in professional life in judgment no of march finalised on june the court of cassation quashed the court of appeal s judgment on the ground inter alia that the court had wrongly construed and applied article of the civil code to the facts of the case it found that termination of an employment contract was not unfair if it was justified by the employer s interests in the proper sense of the term such as the restoration of peaceful working relations between employees and the smooth operation of the company where these were liable to be disrupted by maintaining the dismissed employee in his or her post the court of cassation held as follows as the dismissal was not motivated by ill-will revenge or any aggressivity on the part of the employer towards the employee the dismissal was fully justified by the interests of the employer in the proper sense of the term interests in that it was done in order to restore peace in the company and its smooth operation the employees were seriously perturbed by the extremely serious and contagious illness of the applicant which aroused feelings of insecurity among them and fears for their health prompting them to request collectively and in writing his dismissal and stress that if he were not dismissed the smooth operation of the company would be severely affected lastly the court of cassation dismissed the applicant s appeal as devoid of purpose and remitted the case to the court of appeal neither the applicant nor his former employer took the initiative reserved to them by statute of applying to the court of appeal for a ruling on the case remitted to it the relevant articles of the greek constitution provide as follows an individual s private and family life is inviolable work constitutes a right and shall enjoy the protection of the state which shall seek to create conditions of employment for all citizens and shall promote the moral and material advancement of the rural and urban working population the rights of human beings as individuals and members of society and the principle of the constitutional welfare state are guaranteed by the state all agents of the state shall be obliged to ensure the unhindered and effective exercise thereof where appropriate these rights shall also apply to the relations between individuals restrictions of any kind which according to the constitution may be imposed upon these rights shall be provided for either directly by the constitution or by statute and shall respect the principle of proportionality. section of law no on dismissal and the termination of employment contracts in the private sector provides a private-sector employee recruited on a contract of indefinite duration who has been employed for more than two months can not be dismissed without prior written notice of termination of the employment contract the relevant sections of law no on equal treatment race nationality religion age sexual orientation read as follows the object of the present law is the adoption of a general regulatory framework in which to combat discrimination based on religion or other beliefs disability age or sexual orientation in the sphere of employment and to ensure that the principle of equal treatment is applied. direct or indirect discrimination on one of the grounds referred to in section shall be forbidden harassment with the aim or effect of adversely affecting a person s dignity and creating an intimidating hostile degrading humiliating or aggressive environment shall also be regarded as discrimination. in order to comply with the principle of equal treatment of disabled persons the employer must take all necessary measures required in the circumstances to ensure that disabled persons have access to a workstation can carry on an activity and develop professionally and take part in professional training in so far as such measures do not impose an unreasonable burden on the employer it shall not be discriminatory to adopt or maintain special measures designed to prevent or compensate for disadvantages based on religious grounds or other beliefs or grounds of disability age or sexual orientation it shall not be discriminatory to adopt or maintain measures protecting the health and safety of disabled persons in the workplace or measures creating or maintaining the conditions or facilities for preserving and promoting their integration in the activity and work. on january the national commission for human rights drew up a report on issues relating to the protection of the rights of hiv-positive persons the introduction to the report reads as follows the national commission for human rights has been prompted to examine issues relating to the protection of the rights of hiv-positive persons by the observed lack of enjoyment of fundamental rights by the said individuals which is exacerbated by stigmatisation manifestations of intolerance violations of confidentiality and other forms of social discrimination to their detriment the impetus for this was judgment no of the court of cassation in which that court actually upheld the lawfulness of the dismissal of an hiv-positive employee and endorsed the conditions in which he was dismissed having regard to the importance of that decision which is the first judicial ruling of its kind in the judicial annals of the country and to the fact that it highlighted a unique but important aspect of the problems facing hiv-positive persons the commission organised a consultation with several other organisations and institutions campaigning for the protection of the rights of such persons a number of issues were raised during the discussion but the ones considered to be the most important were the following a stigmatisation as a result of hiv/aids b discriminatory treatment of persons infected with the virus particularly in the workplace c access by such persons to health services and d protection of their private life. in its final considerations the commission observed there is a current and pressing need to protect the rights of hiv-positive persons and to institutionalise and apply the fundamental principles on which these rights are based having regard to the fact that according to the latest official statistics the disease appears to have reached alarming levels in our country the risks do not stem only from the disease itself and the fact that it is spreading but also from the formation and consolidation of dangerous and scientifically unfounded misconceptions through court rulings which maintain that hiv-positive employees constitute a ‘ danger in their workplace lastly we should point out that the protection of the rights of hiv-positive persons does not concern them alone but public health in general in that if these people are not protected they will hesitate to be tested which will undermine the efforts being made by public-health organisations to limit the spread of the disease. this recommendation is the first human rights instrument on hiv and aids in the world of work it was adopted by a large majority by government representatives employers and workers of the member states of the ilo at the international labour conference in june it provides inter alia as follows c t here should be no discrimination against or stigmatization of workers in particular jobseekers and job applicants on the grounds of real or perceived hiv status or the fact that they belong to regions of the world or segments of the population perceived to be at greater risk of or more vulnerable to hiv infection governments in consultation with the most representative organizations of employers and workers should consider affording protection equal to that available under the discrimination employment and occupation convention to prevent discrimination based on real or perceived hiv status real or perceived hiv status should not be a ground of discrimination preventing the recruitment or continued employment or the pursuit of equal opportunities consistent with the provisions of the discrimination employment and occupation convention real or perceived hiv status should not be a cause for termination of employment temporary absence from work because of illness or caregiving duties related to hiv or aids should be treated in the same way as absences for other health reasons taking into account the termination of employment convention when existing measures against discrimination in the workplace are inadequate for effective protection against discrimination in relation to hiv and aids members should adapt these measures or put new ones in place and provide for their effective and transparent implementation. the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe pace has raised the question of hiv/aids in a number of documents in its recommendation on aids and human rights it stated the following noting that although the council of europe has been concerned with prevention ever since the ethical aspects have been touched upon only cursorily considering nevertheless that it is essential to ensure that human rights and fundamental freedoms are not jeopardised on account of the fear aroused by aids concerned in particular at the discrimination to which some aids victims and even seropositive persons are being subjected recommends that the committee of ministers instruct the steering committee for human rights to give priority to reinforcing the non-discrimination clause in article of the european convention on human rights either by adding health to the prohibited grounds of discrimination or by drawing up a general clause on equality of treatment before the law in its resolution on hiv/aids in europe pace reaffirmed its commitment to combating all forms of discrimination against persons living with hiv/aids while emphasising that the hiv/aids pandemic is an emergency at the medical social and economic level the assembly calls upon parliaments and governments of the council of europe to ensure that their laws policies and practices respect human rights in the context of hiv/aids in particular the right to education work privacy protection and access to prevention treatment care and support protect people living with hiv/aids from all forms of discrimination in both the public and private sectors article of the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights provides that the rights enunciated in the covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national or social origin property birth or other status in its general comment on non-discrimination no the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights expressly stated that the expression other status appearing at the end of article of the covenant included health status in particular hiv status health status refers to a person s physical or mental health states parties should ensure that a person s actual or perceived health status is not a barrier to realizing the rights under the covenant the protection of public health is often cited by states as a basis for restricting human rights in the context of a person s health status however many such restrictions are discriminatory for example when hiv status is used as the basis for differential treatment with regard to access to education employment health care travel social security housing and asylum in the case of hoffmann v. south african airways cct of september an application had been made to the constitutional court against a decision of the witwatersrand high court regarding discrimination in the employment of mr hoffmann as a cabin attendant for the airline company south african airways on the ground that he was hiv-positive the company relied on three arguments the negative reaction of hiv-positive persons to the yellow fever vaccine the risk of transmitting diseases to passengers and other members of the company and the low return on investment in such staff as they had a lower life expectancy than the others the constitutional court unanimously held that such discrimination had breached mr hoffmann s constitutional rights firstly it held that a distinction had to be made between hiv-positive persons and persons suffering from immune deficiency it observed that mr hoffmann had been only hiv-positive at the time of his dismissal and the court s decision it added that the practice of other foreign airlines had no bearing on an examination of the constitutionality of the decision secondly it recognised that a company s commercial concerns were legitimate but considered that these should not serve as a pretext for denying elementary fundamental rights such as compassion and tolerance of others having regard to those overriding considerations persons infected with hiv were in a particularly fragile situation which required full protection under the legal system accordingly the court held that the violation of mr hoffmann s rights required the airline to offer him a job forthwith and to bear the costs of the proceedings a comparative study of the legislation of thirty member states of the council of europe on the protection provided under domestic law to hiv-infected persons from discrimination in the employment context shows that seven states albania azerbaijan italy the republic of moldova romania the united kingdom and russia have passed specific legislation in this respect in the twenty-three other states which have not passed specific legislation hiv-positive persons who face differences in treatment in the workplace can rely on the general provisions of domestic law governing non-discrimination the decisions of the domestic courts and other bodies for human rights protection in some of these states show that they grant protection against dismissal to hiv-positive persons through the prohibition imposed on other grounds of discrimination such as health or disability in france for example on september the equal treatment commission the human rights council since october found that the law on equal treatment of persons suffering from a disability or chronic illness did not oblige an employee the case in question concerned the dismissal of an hiv-positive employee of a licensed bar to disclose his or her illness unless he or she would otherwise be unable to perform the work the commission also found that the supposed prejudice of customers towards hiv-positive persons did not justify terminating the contract on december the pontoise criminal court in france sentenced an employer to five months imprisonment suspended and ordered him to pay eur in damages for dismissing purportedly on economic grounds one of his employees a veterinary assistant who was hiv-positive even before the enactment in belgium of the law of may on combating certain forms of discrimination the dendermonde labour court had held on january that an employer had abused his right to terminate an employment contract by dismissing an employee solely on account of his hiv infection the swiss federal supreme court judgment bge iii held that dismissal from work solely on account of hiv infection was discriminatory and unfair for the purposes of article of the code of obligations on october the poltava regional court in ukraine ordered the editor of a newspaper to pay compensation to a journalist who had been dismissed because he was hiv-positive in croatia following the intervention of the ombudsman the police internal rules which had previously provided that an hiv-positive person could neither become nor remain a serving police officer were amended on november the polish constitutional court declared unconstitutional a provision of the ministry of interior s regulations according to which any police officer who was hiv-positive should automatically be declared unfit for service on april the russian supreme court declared inoperative
