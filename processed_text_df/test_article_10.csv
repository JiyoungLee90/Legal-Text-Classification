the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr aleksandr nikolayevich krutov the applicant on march the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by mr m. rachkovskiy a lawyer practising in the russian government the government were represented by mr p. laptev former representative of the at the european court of human rights the applicant alleged in particular that he had been found liable for expressing his opinion on october the president of the first section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the applicant was born in and lives in on january the applicant published an article under the headline the political scene in old faces and new times политические расклады года старые лица и новые времена in issue no of the nedelya oblasti newspaper the article examined the interplay of political groups in the saratov region and in particular the part played by the prosecutor 's office of the saratov region and b. the saratov regional prosecutor b. sued the applicant and the editorial board for defamation before the kirovskiy district court of saratov he claimed that the following extract from the article had damaged his honour dignity and professional reputation probably only this the political union between the town hall and the regional prosecutor 's office can account for the regional prosecutor 's office 's perseverance in instigating criminal proceedings against members of the regional government while at the same time shielding the serving officials of the town hall and the town legislature from criminal prosecution for example in the corruption-ridden case of the town charity fund for health care support charges had been brought against only one member of the town legislature mr k but shortly thereafter he was acquitted and the mayor 's close circle headed by mr a in person was spared responsibility in gratitude for support the town hall started supplying the prosecutor 's offices with 'gifts in the form of foreign-made cars and furniture as to the regional prosecutor mr b the town hall allocated to him under a lease agreement a plot of land in the courtyard of the block of flats where he lives allegedly for development the district court commissioned a linguistic examination of the impugned extract by four experts from on september the panel of four experts returned their unanimous findings in their assessment the article did not give an appraisal of b 's character nor did it damage his honour or professional reputation the publication might create the impression that the prosecutor 's actions had been unseemly and cast doubt on the lawfulness of a lease agreement for such a long term and the validity of its purpose however these issues called for a legal rather than a linguistic examination the experts concurred that the words probably only this can account for and in gratitude for support were expressions of the journalist 's personal opinion rather than statements of fact the author did not allege that prosecutor b. had received any benefits for his support of the town hall the journalist merely supposed that the prosecutor had not been impartial and that criminal charges against officials had been brought selectively on november the kirovskiy district court of saratov gave judgment finding against the applicant for the following reasons taking into account the factual circumstances of the case the court considers that in the applicant 's article the plaintiff mr b. can not be viewed as a private individual because in the public perception having regard to the fact that the plaintiff is a public figure the plaintiff is mr b. the citizen who holds the office of the saratov regional prosecutor and must observe higher standards in his personal and professional image and his daily actions the court further considers that the term 'prosecutor 's offices employed in the article also referred to the plaintiff because by virtue of his office he is responsible for the operation of all the prosecutor 's offices in the entire region having regard to the above the court considers that the excerpt from the article at issue is nothing but statements сведения disseminated about the plaintiff that are damaging to his honour dignity and professional reputation the court does not consider proven the defendants argument that they disseminated a journalist 's opinion based on facts because the author 's opinion must not only be founded on specific statements but must also not damage the plaintiff 's reputation or honour and must not contain statements about the plaintiff 's unlawful conduct since the purpose of expressing an opinion is to convey it to third parties the form of its expression must exclude the possibility of misleading a reasonable third party as to whether such information is an opinion or a statement of fact the court considers that in the present case the defendants have failed to meet these requirements and the statements contained in the article are statements of fact amenable to proof in judicial proceedings the district court noted that the underlying facts in the impugned excerpt were not disputed thus criminal proceedings were indeed brought against certain members of the regional government including the member of the town legislature k. mr b. had received a plot of land under the conditions indicated by the applicant and the town hall had put at the disposal of the prosecutor 's offices free of charge a hyundai car six tables and nine filing cabinets however in the district court 's view the applicant had failed to show that the mayor 's close circle had been spared responsibility and that furniture a foreign-made car or a land plot had been offered in gratitude for support the district court held that the entire extract had been defamatory ordered the newspaper to publish a rectification and recovered russian roubles each from the applicant and the newspaper on december the on an appeal by the applicant upheld the judgment article guarantees freedom of thought and expression together with freedom of the mass media article provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of statements сведения that are damaging to his or her honour dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness the aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by standard verlags gmbh the applicant company on june the applicant was represented by ms m. windhager a lawyer practising in the austrian government the government were represented by their agent ambassador f. trauttmansdorff head of the law department at the federal ministry of european and international affairs the applicant company alleged a violation of its right to freedom of expression on may the president of the first section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the applicant a limited liability company with its seat in is the owner of the daily newspaper der standard in its issue of may der standard published an article in the domestic politics section under the heading gossip mongering kolportiert the article which was entitled a society rumour ein bürgerliches gerücht commented on certain rumours relating to the marriage of mr klestil the then federal president the article also appeared on the website of der standard it read as follows if the stories circulating between the outlying district of döbling and the city centre are to be believed there is only one topic of conversation at the moment among the socalled upper crust of viennese society the marriage of the departing presidential couple thomas klestil and margot klestil-löffler bold print in the original rumour has it that not only is he about to leave office but she is about to leave him the latter claim has of course set tongues wagging furiously in bourgeois and not-so-bourgeois circles people here like nothing better than to be able to express outrage about one of their own in addition to the allegedly less-than-blissful domestic situation on the hohe warte the federal president s residence there has been persistent gossip recently about the supposedly close ties between the first lady who is her husband s junior by years and other political figures head of the fpö parliamentary group herbert scheibner bold print in the original for instance is reported to be close to her scheibner has accompanied the presidential couple on a number of foreign trips ms löffler is also said to be well acquainted with the husband of the canadian ambassador unsurprisingly given her post as head of the american department of the foreign affairs ministry the fact that the president s wife took a few days off recently to organise the move from the official residence to the couple s newly renovated home in hietzing fuelled further speculation so much so in fact that klestil never squeamish about putting his emotions on display had the following pre-emptive statement published in his information bulletin news an austrian weekly ‘ rumours of a separation are nothing but idle gossip he said he added as of july we will be embarking on a new phase of our life together any assertions to the contrary are untrue be that as it may the people are concerned for the well-being of their president apparently the public information desk of the president s office has recently had more callers than ever before enquiring about the state of the president s marriage and more than a few of the callers made their enquiries in the ultra-refined tones of schönbrunn. the article was accompanied by a picture of mr klestil and mrs klestil-löffler looking in different directions on may mr klestil and mrs klestil-löffler brought proceedings under sections and of the media act mediengesetz against the applicant company claiming that the article published in der standard of may reported on their marriage and family life and thus interfered with the strictly personal sphere of their lives by judgment of june the vienna regional criminal court landesgericht für strafsachen ordered the applicant company to pay compensation of euros eur to the first claimant mr klestil and eur to the second claimant mrs klestil-löffler furthermore the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and to reimburse the claimants costs the referring to section of the media act held that the applicant company had reported on the strictly personal sphere of the claimants lives in a manner that was likely to undermine them in public it analysed the contents of the impugned article as alleging on the one hand that mrs klestil-löffler intended to divorce and on the other hand that she had close contacts with two men thus describing her as a double adulteress and mr klestil as a deceived husband in reply to the applicant company s defence that the article merely reported on a rumour the noted that even the dissemination of a rumour could breach section of the media act if it conveyed the impression that there was some truth in it as to the applicant company s request to take evidence in order to show that the rumour had actually been spread at the time the court noted that in cases concerning an infringement of the strictly personal sphere of a person s life section of the media act excluded the proof of truth wahrheitsbeweis unless the statement at issue was directly related to public life such a direct link would exist for instance where a publication reported on the state of health of the federal president which might prevent him from exercising his functions however the state of his marriage did not have any bearing on his capacity to exercise his functions nor did it have any other link with public life in assessing the amount of compensation the had regard to the fact that der standard was a widely read newspaper and to the considerable degree of insult suffered by the claimants in addition it noted that it was highly uncommon in to report on true or untrue details of the private lives of politicians having regard to the above considerations and the need to deter other media from making similar publications a relatively large amount of compensation appeared justified the difference in the sums awarded was to the fact that the second claimant was described as a double adulteress while the first claimant was merely depicted as a deceived husband the applicant company appealed as a point of law it submitted that the had wrongly refused its request for the taking of evidence in its view the publication was directly related to public life within the meaning of section of the media act the claimants being public figures had made their private life part of their marketing strategy like no other presidential couple before they had kept the public informed about their marriage starting with the first claimant s divorce from his former wife and his remarriage to the second claimant moreover the first claimant had relied heavily on family values during his first electoral campaign he therefore had to accept that the public had an interest in being informed about his private life as regards points of fact the applicant company argued that the had wrongly assessed the contents of the article at issue read in its proper context the article did not state that mrs klestil-löffler actually intended to divorce and even less that she was an adulteress on the contrary the article rather aimed at exposing the idle gossip propagated in certain upper-class circles it clearly pointed to the absurdity of the rumour by explaining that the allegedly close ties of the second claimant with mr scheibner and with the husband of the canadian ambassador had perfectly unsuspicious reasons seen in that light the article did not even relate to the strictly personal sphere of the presidential couple but made fun of the gossip in bourgeois society as regards the sentence the applicant company claimed that the compensation awards were excessive while the appeal proceedings were pending mr klestil died by decision of september the vienna regional criminal court discontinued the proceedings as regards mr klestil on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht on an appeal brought by mr klestil s estate quashed the s decision by a judgment of january the vienna court of appeal upheld the s judgment of june it confirmed that in the present case the proof of truth was excluded by section of the media act the applicant company s argument that the claimants were public figures and had exposed their private and marital life to the public eye like no other presidential couple before was not convincing while the first claimant had relied on his family life and on his then marriage in his first campaign some twelve years ago his marriage with mrs klestil-löffler had not played a role in his second campaign nor otherwise during his second period in office moreover his second and last period in office had been drawing to a close at the time of the publication in sum the had rightly found that the publication at issue was not directly related to public life consequently it had rightly refused to take the evidence proposed by the applicant company there was no basis for the applicant company s assertion that the article was aimed at unveiling the hypocrisy of the so called upper crust of viennese society or that it described the rumours about the claimants marriage as absurd the had rightly understood the article s contents as conveying rumours about the federal president s marriage as if there was some truth in them finally as regards the amounts granted in compensation the court of appeal found that deterring other media from similar publications was not a relevant criterion nevertheless the other considerations relied on by the justified the compensation awards on june mr scheibner brought proceedings under sections and of the media act against the applicant company in respect of the electronic version of the article which had been published on the website of der standard and in respect of the print version he alleged that the passage referring to him contained an untrue statement amounting to defamation by judgment of july the vienna regional criminal court ordered the applicant company to pay eur to mr scheibner as compensation for the publication in the printed version of der standard and eur as compensation for the publication on the website furthermore the court ordered the applicant company to publish its judgment and to reimburse the claimant s costs the court arguing along the same lines as in its judgment of june see paragraphs above held that the applicant company had reported on the strictly personal sphere of the claimant s life in a manner that was likely to undermine him in public it analysed the contents of the impugned article as alleging that the claimant mr scheibner who was a married man had a close relationship with mrs klestil-löffler and therefore described him as an adulterer thus his strictly personal sphere was affected however it found that the publication did not amount to defamation within the meaning of article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch as to the amount of compensation it considered that the insult as regards mr scheibner weighed less heavily than as regards the claimants in the first set of proceedings in sum compensation awards of eur as regards the publication in the paper version of der standard and eur for the publication on the website which was less widely read appeared appropriate the applicant company and mr scheibner appealed whereby the applicant company relied on the same grounds as in its appeal in the previous set of proceedings on december the vienna court of appeal dismissed the applicant company s appeal but partly granted mr scheibner s appeal it held that the impugned statement also breached article of the media act since it fulfilled the objective elements of defamation as defined in article of the criminal code the claimant was accused of adultery which even in a liberal society was still considered an unlawful and dishonourable act it considered however that this had no influence on the amount of compensation to be paid which was therefore upheld as to the applicant company s appeal the court of appeal again confirmed the s reading of the contents of the article it added that the placement of the article in the domestic politics section and its presentation including the picture of the presidential couple supported this assessment furthermore the appellate court noted that the applicant company had not argued before the regional court that the publication was directly related to public life within the meaning of article of the media act in any case mr scheibner though a public figure had a right to respect for the strictly personal sphere of his life rumours about an alleged relationship between him and the wife of the federal president had no link with his public functions and responsibilities and did therefore not justify the reporting at issue once the judgment of the court of appeal had become final mr scheibner brought proceedings under the civil code allgemeines bürgerliches gesetzbuch requesting an injunction ordering the applicant company to refrain from publishing any statement alleging that he had a relationship with mrs klestil-löffler at the hearing of april before the handelsgericht the applicant company entered into a settlement with mr scheibner undertaking to refrain from publishing any such statement the noted that according to constant case-law a judgment under section of the media act had binding effect in subsequent civil proceedings relating to the same facts it ordered the applicant company to pay mr scheibner s procedural costs the s judgment was served on the applicant company s counsel on may the applicant company did not appeal section of the media act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation the victim can thus claim damages from him in this context defamation has been defined in article of the criminal code strafgesetzbuch as follows anybody who in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine anyone who commits this offence in a printed document by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine the person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true in the case of the offence defined in paragraph he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true. section of the media act provides a claim for damages in cases of interference with the strictly personal sphere of an individual s life in the version in force at the material time it read as follows if the strictly personal sphere of an individual s life is discussed or portrayed in the media in a way liable to publicly undermine the individual concerned he or she shall have the right to claim compensation for the damage sustained from the media proprietor publisher the amount of compensation may not exceed euros the right referred to in paragraph above shall not apply where i the

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a bulgarian national mr marin yordanov kostov the applicant on february the applicant was represented by mr e. abrashev a lawyer practising in the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agent ms m. dimova of the ministry of justice the applicant alleged in particular that his punishment with solitary confinement for having complained against the prison administration amounted to a violation of his rights under articles and of the convention on december the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the case was later transferred to the fourth section of the court following the reorganisation of the court s sections on february the applicant was born in and is currently serving a prison sentence in pleven prison the applicant was detained in belene prison from an unspecified date in august until march when he was moved to pleven prison he stated that the conditions of detention in belene prison had been inhuman and degrading it appears that the applicant submitted frequent complaints to various institutions against the administration of belene prison on an unspecified date in he complained to the prosecuting authorities that some of the letters he had sent had been withheld by the administration and had never reached their addressees following an inquiry his complaint was dismissed both by the regional prosecutor on july and on appeal on august by the prosecutor in appeal proceedings who established that between january and june the applicant had sent thirty-one letters which had been duly entered in the prison register and forwarded to their addressees on and october the director of belene prison ordered the confinement of the applicant in an isolation cell for two five-day periods following two violent incidents between the applicant and another prisoner which had occurred at short intervals the applicant appealed the levski district court opened two sets of proceedings and on november examined the applicants appeals in two separate hearings held consecutively the applicant appeared in person while the prison administration did not send a representative at the start of the first hearing the court stated that it had summoned mr k. a prison guard as a witness it noted that mr k. had not appeared the prison administration having submitted a medical certificate to the effect that he had been admitted to hospital the applicant requested that another prison guard mr s. be questioned but nevertheless agreed that the court should proceed with the examination of the case on the merits the applicant stated that he had been insulted and attacked by an inmate he denied having insulted the inmate concerned and claimed that he was not responsible for the incident and that the punishment was unjustified in a final decision of the same date the district court upheld the order of october stating that the director of the prison had taken into consideration all relevant circumstances and had delivered a reasoned and lawful order the director had considered the applicant s and witnesses statements and the report of a prison employee the court further noted that the written statements of the witnesses corroborated the director s conclusions and did not support the applicant s account of the events as to the punishment it had been determined with due regard to the gravity of the offence and the applicant s conduct as a whole then the court proceeded with the second hearing it noted that the prison guard mr s. who had been summoned as a witness was also in hospital the applicant insisted on the appearance of mr s. and stated that he wanted to call a second witness mr f. he also asked to be assigned a court-appointed lawyer and sought an adjournment the court dismissed those requests stating that it was obliged to complete the examination of the applicant s appeal within three days of its being lodged and that the absence of a lawyer was not a reason for adjourning the hearing on the merits the applicant explained that the incident had been similar to the first one and that he had been insulted and attacked by the same inmate in a final decision of the same date the district court upheld the order of october it found that on september a conflict had arisen between the applicant and another prisoner which had developed into a fight that had necessitated the intervention of the guard on duty the director of the prison had taken into consideration all relevant circumstances and had delivered a reasoned and lawful order he had considered the applicant s and witnesses statements and the report of a prison employee the court further noted that the written statements of the witnesses corroborated the director s conclusions and did not support the applicant s account of the events as to the punishment it had been determined with due regard to the gravity of the offence and the applicant s conduct as a whole on december while the applicant was isolated in a disciplinary cell in connection with the above punishments his mother sent him a parcel which was not delivered to him on an unspecified date in december the applicant asked why his right to receive parcels had been restricted the prison administration informed him that no parcel had arrived on january the applicant complained to the public prosecutor that the prison administration had refused to give him the parcel he requested that the matter be investigated and the responsible officials punished he stated that the prison employees often made such mistakes in respect of prisoners lastly he stated that the incident amounted to a criminal offence under article of the criminal code which made it an offence to inter alia hide or destroy a package intended for another person on january the applicant gave a copy of his complaint to a prison employee who transmitted it to the prison director following an internal inquiry it was established that on december a parcel for the applicant had indeed arrived and was sent back to the sender because the applicant was not entitled to receive parcels while in isolation in relation to the above the director of belene prison considered the applicant s statements to the public prosecutor defamatory and on january punished him with fourteen days isolation in a disciplinary cell he also justified the punishment on grounds of the applicant s overall conduct referring to the punishments imposed on him on and october see paragraph above and the fact that the applicant had frequently sent similar complaints to various institutions the applicant appealed the district court held a hearing on february an employee of the prison submitted that the parcel had been lawfully returned because prisoners were not allowed to receive parcels while punished with solitary confinement the witness further stated that he had suggested that the applicant be punished because the latter had made insulting and defamatory statements against the prison administration the witness pointed out that this was the applicant s third breach of the disciplinary rules the applicant replied that he would not have complained to the public prosecutor had the prison administration informed him about the parcel he stated that he had not received a reply from the public prosecutor in a final decision of the same date the district court upheld the order of january it referred to the statements of the witness and the information contained in the disciplinary file and held that the order was reasoned and lawful and that the conduct of the applicant within the last year had been taken into consideration on an unspecified date in the applicant requested the general directorate of enforcement of sentences at the ministry of justice to transfer him to another prison stating that the administration of belene prison had subjected him to harassment in particular he referred to the dispute about the parcel and the ensuing punishment see paragraphs above on march the deputy minister of justice granted the applicant s request and ordered that he be moved to pleven prison he noted that the prison authorities had given inaccurate information to the applicant about the parcel and that therefore the applicant had acted in good faith in complaining to the public prosecutor the honesty of his intention was also evident from the fact that he had provided the prison administration with a copy of his complaint the deputy minister further noted that prisoners were entitled to make applications and complaints to public bodies and stressed that the disciplinary liability envisaged in the enforcement of sentences act could not be used to restrict that right noting that the punishment of january had been upheld by the court and had become final the deputy minister considered that the applicant had understandably lost confidence in the administration of belene prison and that that risked jeopardising his reform should he remain in that prison under section k of the execution of sentences act esa of in force at the relevant time a prisoner who violated prison regulations or disciplinary rules or failed to fulfil his duties could be punished by inter alia confinement in an isolation cell for up to fourteen days during

excluded and the absence of the prisoner s lawyer was not an obstacle to the examination of the case the court was obliged to examine all circumstances relevant to the lawfulness of the punishment its

was born in he lives in istanbul and works as a psychologist in november he published an anthology of poems in istanbul entitled the song of a rebellion dersim dersim bir i̇syanın türküsü on january the public prosecutor at the istanbul national security court no the public prosecutor the national security court accused the applicant and his publisher of disseminating propaganda against the indivisible unity of the state he requested inter alia application of section of the prevention of terrorism act law no see paragraph below and the confiscation of the copies of the work concerned see paragraph below he relied on the following passages from that anthology in support of his request … freedom is the law of the clan … a great passion is taking shape in our holy hands the light of ancient kurdistan for as long as by the light of day the munzursuyu is not reddened by our blood we shall not let the whelps of the ottoman whore trample upon it after all for thousands of years we have obeyed the law freedom is the law of the clan in solitude they looked at the tombstones the heart of dersim is torn to pieces its serpentine streets explosions of dynamite the noise of excavators the soldiers boots … a phial of medicine in one hand of poison in the other the towers of babel in others the turks are coming with their schools their language in which we know only too well the word for cruelty … in the corridors of parliament in the galleries in the garrisons they are preparing genocide like those who know no bounds … on the head of hızır my brave one we have never seen nor heard anything like this i ask you brother what scripture would accept such cruelty … silently they looked towards the village of deşt … and now cruelty is spreading apace our blood will mix with the blood shed resistance and betrayal freedom and surrender side by side … have we not accepted as law for thousands of years that blood shall be washed in blood … in their solitude their tears fell to the ground … thousands of years of disasters have not altered our lives for our kurdistan for our dersim we will sacrifice our heads drunk on the fire of rebellion … in solitude they oiled the guns and rifles … let us go children of the unyielding we have heard there is a rebellion in the mountains can we hear and do nothing let the festivities and celebrations begin let flames as high as the rooftops reach for the sky so that before the day s end the cannons fall silent venerable kurdistan beautiful kurdistan kurdistan our friend … they marched towards the laws to be brothers … for thousands of years companion we have been the close acquaintance of the most barbaric cruelties i ask you out of love for the age in which you live how much longer will we put up with this cruelty … to the majestic mountains that will lead us to freedom … snowy are the mountains … the whelps of the ottoman whore repeatedly pound our mountains the waters that run our springtime … they are preparing genocide like those who know no bounds … for thousands of years our clan has been under siege in our besieged land … the mountains before us have voices of snow … an unbounded anger in my heart a speechless hatred … the laws do not give way rebellion comes from the mountains the millennia of history some have died for her some march to their deaths they marched towards solitude … those who were but a handful of brave men the hope and resistance of their blessed bodies they have piece by piece adorned freedom those who before us marched to their deaths … young kurds ‘ i am seventy-five years old i die a martyr i join the martyrs of kurdistan dersim has been defeated but kurdism and kurdistan shall live on the young kurd shall take vengeance when life leaves this body my heart shall not cry out what happiness to live this day to join the martyrs of kurdistan … alişer is dead too … we have lived for centuries without a state in exile during massacres for centuries along the paths we have hauled behind us a sword but never have we been conquered by the sword … the venerable sheikh alişer of hasanan was brave enough to know how to die for his honour his homeland and his freedom … how can i narrate to those who will come after us all that is brave and heroic impregnating my whole body with courage … i invite you to freedom to death in these mountains in this sacred spring with death we march freedom is blessed with death i invite you to die time is wounded like the beat of a heart … exile … garrisons garrison schools kids women … valiant youths songs of revenge mothers of children hand-to-hand side by side surrender and resistance and the dignity and the honour and the pride of the kurd become by the vows of the mazlum doğans of the ali haydar yıldızes of the hayri durmuşes of the delil doğans little by little drop by drop a secret rebellion. the applicant denied the charges before the national security court asserting in particular that the passage in inverted commas see paragraph above was a quotation which in no way reflected his own opinions on february the national security court composed of three judges including a military judge found the applicant guilty of the offences charged and sentenced him under section of law no to one year and eight months imprisonment and a fine of turkish liras trl to be paid in ten monthly instalments it also ordered confiscation of the publications concerned the national security court entirely accepted the submissions of the public prosecutor and found inter alia that the poems in issue referred to a particular region of turkey as kurdistan and had glorified the insurrectionary movements in that region by identifying them with the kurds fight for national independence in the national security court s view the expression of praise apparent throughout the work amounted to separatist propaganda that was detrimental to the unity of the turkish nation and the territorial integrity of the turkish state and justified mr karataş s conviction in a judgment of july the court of cassation dismissed an appeal by the applicant the applicant s subsequent application to the same court for rectification of the judgment was also unsuccessful on october law no of october came into force inter alia it reduced the length of prison sentences that could be imposed under section of law no while increasing the level of fines see paragraph below in a transitional provision relating to section law no provided that sentences imposed pursuant to section of law no would be automatically reviewed see paragraph below consequently the national security court reviewed the applicant s case on the merits in a judgment of april it reduced mr karataş s prison sentence to one year one month and ten days but increased the fine to trl on an appeal by the applicant the court of cassation upheld that decision on december mr karataş was at that time still serving his sentence in ümraniye prison istanbul the relevant provisions of the criminal code read as follows article where the legislative provisions in force at the time when a crime is committed are different from those of a later law the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied. article in the event of conviction the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two norwegian nationals mr john olav egeland and mr einar hanseid the applicants on september the applicants were represented by mr. k. eggen a lawyer practising in the norwegian government the government were represented by their agent mrs f. platou amble attorney at the attorney general s office civil matters the applicants alleged in particular that their conviction and sentence to a fine by the norwegian courts for unlawful publication of photographs under section of the administration of courts act of a person while leaving a court building gave rise to a violation of article of the convention by a decision of november the court declared the application admissible the applicants were born in and respectively the first applicant lives in bekkestua near oslo and the second applicant lives in at the material time the first applicant was the editor in chief of dagbladet and the second applicant was the editor in chief of aftenposten two major national newspapers in the present case has its background in the same case-complex as a previous application radio hele norge asa v. norway dec. no echr like the latter it concerns a complaint under article of the convention about restrictions on media coverage of a major criminal trial in this case concerning charges against four persons of triple murder the so-called orderud case which took place before the nes district court herredsrett from april to june this was probably the most spectacular and media-focused criminal case in norwegian history the trial involved a son a and his wife b the wife s half-sister c and a friend of the latter d who were charged with the murder of the son s parents and sister committed in a particularly brutal manner because of the great media interest in the case and since the hearing room was too small to host both members of the ordinary public and media representatives special arrangements were made enabling the press to follow the trial at a press centre set up in a sports hall to which sound and pictures were transmitted live and shown on a television screen on may a chamber of the former third section declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded s complaint that a refusal by the district court under section of the administration of courts act domstolloven- hereinafter the act to grant its application for radio broadcasting directly from the court hearing room violated article of the convention the case under consideration concerns restrictions on the publication by the press of photographs taken of b without her consent outside the court house while leaving shortly after having attended the district court s delivery of its judgment of june convicting a b and c of the charges and sentencing each of them to years imprisonment and sentencing d to years imprisonment the delivery of the district court s judgment was broadcast live on tv by two leading national broadcasting companies the nrk and the the broadcast did not contain any pictures of b in the proceedings summarised here below the supreme court in paragraph of its judgment relying on the district court findings described the circumstances in which the photographing of b had taken place as follows the district court has established as a fact that during the reading out of the judgment b realised that she would be found guilty and that she suffered a physical reaction in the form of nausea because of this she went to the toilet together with one of her defence counsels ms y advokat thereafter she entered a side room where she cried and was in deep despair shortly afterwards she was notified that she had been rearrested to be remanded in custody the rumour had spread and a large number of photojournalists were waiting outside the community hall b left the building minutes after the judgment had been pronounced together with defence counsel ms y accompanied by a plain-clothes police officer who walked a few metres behind them on the way to the unmarked police car which was parked metres from the exit she was photographed a number of times on june dagbladet published and extra edition featuring a photograph covering two thirds of a page showing b holding a handkerchief to her face and her lawyer y taken in a side angle from behind the picture was part of an article entitled the farm dispute led to homicide an article underneath was entitled tense atmosphere before verdict the caption stated arrested b was this morning sentenced to years of prison here while crying she is guided out of the premises by her lawyer y on june dagbladet published a smaller photograph showing b seated inside an unmarked police car the picture is part of an article entitled broken with an accompanying text the heavy trip b is lead out of the court house and taken to lillestrøm police station. on june aftenposten published a photograph covering one fifth of a page showing b crying outside the court house taken from the front holding a handkerchief while her lawyer y walks next to her and makes a deprecating gesture toward the photographer a person walks behind identified as a plain clothes police officer underneath the caption states years b has realised it now that freedom will not be the outcome she is supported on the way out by defence counsel y. the picture appeared next to an article entitled firm clear and appealed commenting on the judgment below on the same page featured another article entitled the words are merciless- they fall like needles against the dense silence twisting around this photograph had been purchased and published by a number of newspapers throughout the country in the above-mentioned issues dagbladet and aftenposten reported on the district court s judgment and on the arrest the prospects of arrests in the event of conviction had been an issue of discussion in the above newspapers during the weeks before b had not given her consent for photographs to be taken of her on the contrary her lawyer y attempted to prevent it the authorisation to broadcast the delivery of the judgment had only concerned the reading out of the judgment as such on july b s defence lawyer f.s. reported the applicants and three of the photographers to the police for violation of section of the act which led to charges being brought against them on october the nedre romerike district court acquitted the defendants of the charges giving inter alia the following reasons the district court underlines that the main rule must still be that the taking of photographs of a convicted person on his or her way out of the court premises is prohibited as is the publication of such images but that the prohibition will not apply where entirely special considerations so indicate in the assessment of the district court such entirely special and weighty considerations are present in this case in this regard the district court notes that b had been convicted of a horrific crime involving the triple homicide of the parents and sister of her husband as has already been noted this crime the investigation and subsequent criminal trial hearing were the subject of unprecedented attention on the part of the media and the general public a further point for the court is that b s identity had since long been revealed photographs of her had appeared in all the country s newspapers numerous times during the course of the investigation and in connection with the trial hearing before nes district court during the period prior to the trial in the district court b had rarely consented to being photographed nevertheless the press took a number of photographs of her without her knowledge however the situation was different during the almost eight week long trial according to the information provided b and her husband had consented to being photographed once per week during the trial the photographs taken during these photo sessions appeared almost daily in the country s biggest newspapers and on various television channels the issue of protection against identification through photographs was accordingly not an argument in this case a key consideration underlying the prohibition against the taking of photographs in section is to protect the accused or convicted person against portrayal in situations in which their self-control is reduced in this case b had been sentenced to the most severe penalty permitted under the law for the triple homicide and was in a form of shock on the other hand the weight of this consideration is somewhat reduced by the fact that the taking of photographs did not take place until minutes after the end of the court hearing at which the judgment was delivered in the meantime she had had the opportunity to compose herself in a side room to the hearing room in the presence of her two defence counsel and members of her family in the assessment of the district court it may be doubtful that these circumstances of themselves are sufficient for it to be necessary to limit the application of the prohibition with the result that publication must be considered permissible pursuant to article of the convention however the court views this in the context of the fact that an arrest situation must be said to have existed at the time a b and c were all arrested by the police during the minutes following the pronouncement of judgment while they were in the side rooms to the court premises in the company of their defence counsel two of the photographs that formed the basis for the penalty charge notices in this case depict b as she crosses the metres between the court premises and the police car that would take her to the police station in lillestrøm the third photograph depicts her seated inside the unmarked police vehicle it is clear that the issue of arrest had been discussed in a number of mass media during the days preceding the pronouncement of judgment there was speculation about whether in the event of a conviction the police would arrest the convicted persons or whether they would remain at liberty awaiting the appeal proceedings before the high court that most people expected would come whatever the outcome in the district court as noted earlier the various editorial boards discussed what the significance of the prohibition against the taking of photographs would be in the event of an arrest situation this issue was also discussed amongst the photojournalists who gathered at the exit from the court premises when it became known that three of the convicted persons had been rearrested based on the information on the case presented before the district court it must be assumed that reasonable doubt as to whether any photographs whatsoever would have been taken of the convicted persons on this occasion had they not been arrested an arrest of this nature must be regarded as a new situation in terms of fact and law this was an event that was awaited with considerable interest by the media and the general public interestingly in the wake of the arrest there was discussion amongst centrally placed lawyers about whether it was correct to arrest the convicted persons or not the district court regards the arrest as a new situation and an event that the mass media could legitimately cover as a news item using both words and images in the assessment of the district court the arrest aspect of the situation overshadows the fact that the convicted persons were on their way out of the court premises aftenposten s feature on june states on the front page on which b is shown being escorted into the prison building that an arrest took place immediately after judgment had been pronounced the arrest is also described in detail in the extra edition of dagbladet on june the court s assessment of the photographs concerned by the penalty charge notices foreleggene is that it is made clear to the reader that the intention of the photographs is to illuminate the situation surrounding the arrest as a general rule there is no prohibition against taking photographs of arrest situations notwithstanding the fact that the arrest in this case was undramatic involving no use of physical force on the part of the police and was carried out with the use of plain-clothes officers and unmarked police vehicles the decisive point as regards the news aspect and the information needs of the media must be that these arrests marked a provisional end to a criminal case that had been the subject of extensive discussion the three defendants who prior to the trial before nes district court had been at liberty for over a year were immediately arrested and subsequently remanded in custody as a result of subsequent developments in the case these three have not been out of prison since their arrest on june the district court accordingly finds having assessed the circumstances as a whole that entirely special considerations are present such that the prohibition against the taking of photographs in section of the act can not entail criminal liability for the journalists and editors charged in this case all five defendants will accordingly be acquitted. the public prosecutor appealed against the applicants acquittal not that of the photographers directly to the supreme court by a judgment of march the supreme court convicted the applicants of having published the impugned photographs in violation of sections and of the act and sentenced each of them to pay nok in fines failing which the fines were to be converted into days imprisonment the supreme court rejected a claim by b for compensation of non-pecuniary damage its reasoning stated by mrs justice stabel and joined in the main by the other members of the formation included the following the district court held that b had not given her consent to being photographed on the contrary y made active attempts on her behalf to prevent the taking of photographs i find in addition that the consent that the district court gave for the pronouncement of the judgment to be transmitted live on television applied only to the reading of the judgment it is in any event clear that the authority of the court to grant an exemption from the prohibition against the taking of photographs in section of the act applies only during the trial itself this provision will accordingly not apply in our case the question in this case is whether it constituted a breach of section of the act and thus a criminal offence pursuant to its section to publish photographs of a weeping b distraught and dissolved in tears leaving the court premises having been convicted of aiding and abetting in a triple homicide if this question were to be answered in the affirmative a further question would arise as to whether the enforcement of the prohibition would be contrary to article of the convention cf section of the human rights act it is the second sentence of section that is of interest in our case the question is what restrictions will follow from the phrase ‘ on his or her way to or from the hearing i agree with the district court that the restrictions on the taking of photographs will apply only ‘ in the immediate vicinity of the court premises i.e normally up to the car parking area and that the special protection that follows from section will not apply after the accused has driven away from the court premises the district court concluded that the provision therefore also encompassed b as she made her way out of the courtroom and into the waiting vehicle i agree with this i also agree with the district court that the fact that she was under arrest at the time does not render the provision inapplicable i must accordingly conclude that the photographs in question contravene the prohibition against the taking of photographs in section .... i must therefore examine whether article of the convention would nevertheless lead to a different outcome on the subject of the general balancing of interests i refer to the discussion in supreme court s judgment in the valebrokk case the supreme court held by three votes to two that the filming by of one of the convicted persons following the pronouncement of judgment in the baneheia case did not constitute a punishable offence the majority found with the support of the minority that the general rule must be that the taking of photographs in the courtroom was prohibited including after the court had adjourned but that this restriction would not apply ‘ where entirely special considerations suggest that the taking and publishing of photographs must be permitted the majority held that the purpose of the prohibition was to protect the ‘ reputation or rights of the accused or convicted person and that accordingly the act pursued a legitimate aim although enforcement of the restrictions on the taking of photographs would generally constitute a serious interference pursuant to article it ought to be considered whether the interference nevertheless was necessary in a democratic society according to article the point of departure must be that it was generally important to protect accused and convicted persons against exposure through the taking of photographs in the courtroom both during the hearing itself and in immediate connection with the hearings the majority noted that most countries had prohibitions against the taking of photographs although the scope and wording varies by way of conclusion paragraph noted that ‘ the reality of this is a general rule prohibiting the taking of photographs in the courtroom after court session has been adjourned and a prohibition against the publication of the photographs although the prohibition will not apply if warranted by entirely special considerations the prosecution has argued that a rule of this nature would undermine the prohibition against the taking of photographs it is of course true that a rule with certain limitations will be less absolute even so a rule of this nature will not give the news media a ‘ free hand to take and publish photographs when deemed expedient the prohibition against the taking of photographs is supported by weighty and genuine considerations not least in the situation immediately after the pronouncement of a judgment accordingly in such a situation strong reasons will have to be adduced for it to be accepted that it is required to photograph the convicted person and to put these pictures on display. the view that the prohibition against the taking of photographs does not violate article would appear to be supported by the inadmissibility decision of may rendered by the european court in radio hele norge asa v. norway dec. no echr the found the application to be manifestly ill-founded the court held that the prohibition against recording and broadcasting must to some extent be viewed as an interference with the freedom of expression provided for in article nevertheless the court held that there was no common ground in the legal systems of the contracting states with regard to radio and television transmission from court proceedings the balance between the need for openness and the need for court proceedings to be conducted without disturbance could be resolved in various ways moreover the court held ‘ depending on the circumstances live broadcasting of sound and pictures from a court hearing room may alter its characteristics generate additional pressure on those involved in the trial and even unduly influence the manner in which they behave and hence prejudice the fair administration of justice the court also held that the national authorities particularly the courts were best placed to assess whether in the individual case the broadcasting of proceedings would conflict with the fair administration of justice by way of conclusion the court noted that on this point the contracting states must enjoy a wide margin of appreciation thus the general rule provided for in section of the administration of courts act which applies equally to broadcasting and the taking of photographs was not found to be problematic in relation to article of the convention it must be assumed that the margin of appreciation with regard to measures that are considered necessary with a view to securing ‘ fair administration of justice is relatively broad the opinions expressed in this decision must also have a bearing in relation to section second sentence of the act the interests that the prohibition against the taking of photographs seeks to safeguard have been summarised in the following way in a note on the case by the director general of public prosecutions -protection against identification through the taking of photographs protection against portrayal in photographs in situations in which the subject s control is reduced the safeguarding of one of the fundamental requirements for due process of law namely that it should inspire trust and show consideration towards the persons involved an accused or convicted person who has to force his or her way through press photographers and television teams may quite apart from the issues of protection of personal integrity that arise feel this to be a considerable additional burden the need to protect the dignity and reputation of the courts since in general it is the courts that require the presence of the accused which of itself may be burdensome it is important that the courts should at the same time ensure that accused persons receive fair and considerate treatment a failure to do so will affect not only the accused person him or herself but also the court which is required to ensure that the accused is treated in a considerate manner while being within and in the vicinity of the court premises this means that in addition to privacy considerations the prohibition against the taking of photographs is supported by entirely central principles for due process although the need to safeguard the openness of proceedings including satisfactory opportunities for an active and alert press is a central consideration this means that a balancing of interests must be conducted the legislators conducted this balancing of interests with the introduction of section of the act and the penal provision in section in connection with the enactment of the criminal procedure act of may nr it is apparent from the legislative history that the background to this was that the existing legislation including the photography act of was not found to afford the accused and convicted persons sufficient protection against being treated as ‘ fair game by the press particularly in cases of major interest to the public i should add that the provision has not been regarded as a problem in relation to article of the convention doubt on this point has mainly attached to other aspects of the new article of the criminal code which was enacted with the legislative change of june nr but which has not yet entered into force this provision entails an extension of the prohibition against the taking of photographs inter alia in relation to suspected persons in the custody of the police given the position of our case i will not discuss this in further detail accordingly i will now move on to consider whether in our case there exist entirely special considerations see the valebrokk ruling according to which the prohibition against the taking of photographs must yield to the freedom of expression in paragraph of the judgment in that case the majority attached weight to the fact that the case the harrowing child killings in baneheia had attracted extensive public interest and that the identity of the convicted person was known it was also noted that the photographs might reveal something significant in a negative sense about his personality the decisive point however which was discussed in paragraph was that by their nature the photographs were corrective in that they showed a different and more unaffected reaction to the judgment than had been publicly expressed by defence counsel this was viewed as information which the public had a right to receive in such a case applied to our case it is clear that the orderud case too was horrifying and was the subject of enormous public interest moreover b s identity was already widely known when the photographs were taken however the photographs of b were in my view of an entirely different nature the reaction that she displayed to the judgment distress and sobbing must be characterised as normal and expected in the circumstances she was in a situation in which she had reduced control in immediate connection with her conviction by the district court in other words she was within the core area of what the prohibition against the taking of photographs is intended to protect the decisive point must therefore be whether other elements were present that would give the press the right to take the photographs and the public the right to see them the decisive point as regards the district court s acquittal was that the arrest which took place directly after judgment was pronounced was perceived as a new situation in fact and in law according to the district court the arrest was an event that it was legitimate for the mass media to cover including with the aid of photographs in my view there are no grounds for maintaining that the arrest meant that ‘ entirely special considerations applied an arrest after a conviction by a court is not entirely unusual and would not have been unexpected in a serious homicide case such as the orderud case in which the accused persons had been at liberty throughout the trial moreover i can not conclude that the considerations that justify the protection against the taking of photographs in and around the court premises should be any less in such a situation as long as the photographs do not show something entirely special for example relating to the procedures of the police during the arrest itself the protection must in my view remain the same the applicants defence counsel has argued forcibly that the shocking offences of which b was convicted and the extensive public interest in the case gave the media a right and a duty to inform even if this was contrary to the interests of the convicted persons moreover in today s media-based society this information would not be complete without photographs which suggested that the scope of the prohibition against the taking of photographs should be limited in my view the protection afforded to the convicted person pursuant to section of the act must in principle apply regardless of the nature of the case and of the media interest that the case evokes in practice persons who have been convicted of very serious and sensational crimes will usually not be able to avoid being identified nevertheless the other considerations justifying the prohibition against the taking of photographs will be present frequently to a greater degree than in the case of other convicted persons i have accordingly concluded that the district court s acquittal is not based on a correct application of the law the case has been sufficiently elucidated for the supreme court to render a new judgment cf section second paragraph of the criminal procedure act the defendants have not objected to this i find that the applicants must be convicted in accordance with the indictment and that the sentence proposed by the prosecution a fine of nok in the alternative a prison sentence of days is appropriate for both parties i will conclude by considering the criminal injuries compensation claim b has filed a claim for damages for non-pecuniary loss not to exceed nok from each of the accused she submits that given their convictions for breaches of sections and of the act the preconditions for awarding damages pursuant to section last sentence of the damage compensation act will also have been met i agree that this may frequently be the case however i will not consider this further since this involves a ‘ may provision and i do not find that there are sufficient grounds to award economic compensation in this case it will be clear from my comments on the question of penalty that considerations of protection of personal privacy have not been dominant in my assessment moreover it is clear from b s testimony that she was not even aware that the photographs had been taken the violation lies solely in the publication of the photographs which were not particularly conspicuous in relation to what had been published about her otherwise this case has first and foremost revolved around the drawing of boundaries between the information work of the press and key principles of legal process given this situation it is my view that criminal sanctions against the editors in the form of fines will be sufficient for the purpose of emphasising that that boundary was transgressed and that there are no grounds for awarding damages. section as in force at the material time of the administration of courts act domstolloven provided during oral proceedings in a criminal case photographing filming and radio or television recordings are prohibited it is also prohibited to take photographs or make recordings of the accused or the convicted on his or her way to or from the hearing or when he or she is staying inside the building in which the hearing takes place without his or her consent if there are special reasons for doing so the court may in the course of the proceedings make an exception from the above prohibition if it can be assumed that it would not unduly affect the examination of the case and no other reasons militate decisively against doing so before authorisation is given the parties should have an opportunity to express their views. section provided that the taking of photos or recordings made in breach of section is punishable by the imposition of fines the appendix to the recommendation rec of the committee of ministers to member states on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings adopted by the committee of ministers on july at the meeting of the ministers deputies contains the following principle of particular interest to the present case principle protection of privacy in the context of on-going criminal proceedings the provision of information about suspects accused or convicted persons or other parties to criminal proceedings should respect their right to protection of privacy in accordance with article of the convention particular protection should be given to parties who are minors or other vulnerable persons as well as to victims to witnesses and to the families of suspects accused and convicted in all cases particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling their identification may have on the persons

the case originated in an application no against the kingdom of belgium lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a belgian autonomous public corporation radio-télévision belge de la communauté française rtbf the applicant company on november the applicant company was represented by mr j. englebert a lawyer practising in brussels the belgian government the government were represented by their agent mr m. tysebaert senior adviser federal justice department the applicant company alleged in particular a violation of its right of access to a court under article of the convention and a violation of its right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press and its right to impart information under article on may the vice-president of the second section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided that the chamber would examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article of the convention the applicant company a public broadcasting corporation serving the french community in belgium produced a long-running monthly news and investigation programme called au nom de la loi in the name of the law focusing in particular on legal matters in the broad sense of the term the programme was described as follows on the rtbf website right from the start au nom de la loi sought to operate on the basis of two main principles standing up for the underdog so that ordinary citizens were always given a say and looking for the hidden agenda so that its journalists investigative skills came to the fore. in dr d.b. a specialist neurosurgeon ran a neurosurgery practice together with a colleague including an on-call service at jolimont hospital a number of belgian newspapers both regional la nouvelle gazette in december and may and national le soir in december and la dernière heure in four articles between and december reported on complaints by various patients who had been operated on by dr d.b only two of the articles mentioned his name according to information provided by the parties none of the articles prompted any reaction on the doctor s part the applicant company subsequently decided to devote a segment of its programme au nom de la loi to medical risks and more generally communication and information problems encountered by patients and the rights available to them using as an example the complaints by dr d.b. s patients as reported in the press while preparing the programme journalists from the applicant company contacted a number of patients medical specialists representatives of the council of the medical association ordre des médecins and dr d.b himself the doctor refused to give a televised interview but agreed to answer questions from the applicant company s journalists during a series of meetings lasting several hours in the presence of his lawyers the programme was scheduled to be broadcast on october by a summons served on october dr d.b instituted proceedings against the applicant company before the president of the brussels court of first instance as the judge responsible for hearing urgent applications he sought an injunction preventing the broadcast of the programme in question with a penalty of five million belgian francs each time it was shown on a television channel in the alternative should the injunction not be granted immediately he sought an order requiring a videotape of the programme to be made available for advance viewing on october the president of the court of first instance granted an interim injunction preventing the programme in question from being broadcast with a penalty of two million belgian francs each time it was shown on a belgian television channel the injunction was to remain in place until a decision was given on the merits provided that the claimant himself instituted proceedings on the merits within one month of the injunction failing which it would cease to have effect the injunction stated that there was no cause on the face of it to doubt the good faith and professionalism of the applicant company s journalists or the objective nature of their investigations and that the claimant had a number of remedies by which to seek redress ex post facto for the damage sustained it concluded that an application for prior restraint should not be granted unless it was established with certainty that the scheduled broadcast would damage the claimant s honour and reputation the injunction noted that it was not disputed that the complaints of the patients whom the applicant company intended to feature in the programme had yet to be considered by any court as matters stood no judicial proceedings had even been brought in respect of most of the complaints furthermore professional confidentiality which dr d.b had cited as his reason for refusing an interview meant that he would be unable to give adequate answers and his silence would at the very least raise doubts among the public as to his professional ability the injunction further pointed out that neurosurgery and the post-operative complications to which it might lead were complex matters and that as a result regard should be had to the difficulty in conveying an understanding of the subject to a non-specialist audience in a feature lasting well under an hour the court did not view the programme before giving its ruling dr d.b had requested that a videotape of the programme be made available for viewing by the court s president but the applicant company in both its written and oral submissions refused to accede to the request dr d.b arranged for the injunction of october to be served the same day at p.m in the event the programme was not in fact cancelled but the feature on the alleged medical errors by dr d.b was replaced by a discussion between a journalist and the programme s producer during the discussion and the preceding news broadcast the applicant company commented at length on the injunction of october describing it as judicial censorship of press freedom dr d.b. s name was mentioned several times on october dr d.b requested a right of reply but the applicant company refused his request in a registered letter of october on november the applicant company appealed to the brussels court of appeal against the injunction on november dr d.b instituted proceedings on the merits against the applicant company in the brussels court of first instance concerning the same subject matter as his urgent application at the preliminary hearing the case was adjourned until further notice with a view to its preparation by the date on which the application was lodged with the court the proceedings were still pending in an interlocutory judgment of december the court of appeal ruling on the appeal against the injunction held that article of the constitution was not applicable in the case as it related only to the print media and not the audio-visual media and that neither article of the constitution nor article of the convention prohibited restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression provided that they had a basis in law it observed that article of the constitution and article of the convention which guaranteed the right to respect for private life together with articles and of the judicial code constituted the law in this regard and empowered the urgent-applications judge to order restrictions on freedom of expression as a preventive measure in cases of flagrant violations of the rights of others in the present case the press release announcing the programme had given reason to believe that the broadcast might damage dr d.b. s honour and reputation and interfere with his private life the court of appeal also ordered the resumption of the proceedings and directed the applicant company to produce the recording of the programme in issue it noted in that connection that since prior restraints on freedom of expression entail considerable dangers intervention by the urgent-applications judge will have democratic legitimacy only if it is limited to cases of flagrant violations of the rights of others and held that the way in which the applicant company had announced and described the programme in question indicated its intention to cause unnecessary harm to the honour reputation and private life of the respondent through public disclosure of information that was inaccurate unverified or lacking in objectivity a screening of the programme took place at a hearing on january besides the extracts from interviews with five patients who considered that they had reason to complain about dr d.b. the programme comprised an interview with a medical specialist who explained the medical problem encountered and the anomalies found in the patients medical records dr d.b. s replies to these comments extracts from interviews with specialists a doctor belonging to the council of the medical association a lawyer specialising in medical law and a ministry of health official and lastly footage of a neurosurgical operation with comments by another doctor in a second judgment delivered on march the court of appeal declared the applicant company s appeal unfounded it held that broadcasting the scheduled programme would be likely to damage dr d.b. s honour and reputation thereby causing him serious non-pecuniary harm and as a result significant pecuniary loss it concluded that the preventive measure of a ban had met a pressing social need had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and had been based on relevant and sufficient grounds more specifically the court of appeal observed that the programme included footage of a series of interviews with patients on whom dr d.b had performed surgery involving a total of five operations the interviews were interspersed with explanatory comments dr y.t discussed the specific cases the journalist who had spoken to dr d.b conveyed the answers he had received from him a medical association representative discussed patients rights and the difficulties faced by doctors working at several different sites in remaining available to see them a lawyer explained patients legal rights and a senior adviser to the minister of health outlined the legislative initiatives being taken to ensure better protection for patients the court of appeal considered that the part of the programme concerning the five operations and their consequences was significantly more important than the part informing the audience about patients rights vis-à-vis their doctor it took the view that the clarification provided by the journalist during the programme namely s o was there a medical error or not we can only ask the question we can not give the answer was unlikely to draw the audience s attention to the fact that there was no conclusive proof of a medical error it further noted that there had been no mention of the experience of satisfied patients and that there was no evidence that the five situations discussed were representative of the experiences of dr d.b. s patients as a whole it observed that the applicant company had not referred to any other serious complaint registered by the medical errors association erreurs médicales and held that the five experiences perceived as failures by the patients did not represent a sufficient number to justify targeting dr d.b in a programme relating to patients rights in the event of medical errors or negligence this number appeared all the more insufficient as only one lawsuit had been brought against the doctor concerned in addition the court of appeal noted that the operations referred to had been very different in nature so that it was unreasonable to consider them all together causing the audience to think that they revealed a common pattern of malpractice which the average viewer not being aware of the complexity of each individual case might have tended to do lastly the court of appeal acknowledged that the programme in issue raised serious matters of public concern since it discussed the rights which patients could assert vis-à-vis their doctor and since there was nothing to suggest that the interviewees had not given an accurate account of their own experiences however it considered that the applicant company had lacked objectivity and had not taken into account the manner in which the average viewer was likely to perceive the information and concluded that the applicant company could not rely on freedom of the press in arguing that the surgery performed by dr d.b deserved to be brought to the public s attention for consumer-protection purposes by giving dissatisfied patients the opportunity to air their views in a programme concerning patients rights in particular it stated the following while it is clear that the programme in issue raises serious matters of public concern since it discusses the rights which patients may assert vis-à-vis their doctor complaints by patients concerning the quality of treatment provided by a particular surgeon can not be of interest to the community as a whole unless it can be established with sufficient certainty from the evidence available that the activities of the doctor in question entail serious health consequences quite apart from the fact that there do not on the face of it appear to be a significant number of complaints against dr d.b it has not been established that they are legitimate there is nothing in the material produced to date by rtbf to support the conclusion that the interviewees have reasonable grounds to believe that they were not given the necessary or appropriate treatment or that their accounts correspond to the objective truth this is not disputed by rtbf the brief report by the medical adviser on the complaints submitted to the medical errors association which contains more questions than answers can not serve as proof no other investigative measures appear to have been taken or to have produced results although there is nothing to suggest that the interviewees did not give an accurate account of their own experiences as perceived by them the credibility that can be attached to the patients or their relatives accounts is not sufficient in the absence of conclusive evidence of medical errors or negligence to justify putting these complaints together to form the main theme of a programme that places dr d.b in the spotlight and accuses him of professional incompetence and negligence in all respects of his practice pre-operative counselling quality of the operation post-operative follow-up it should also be noted that the programme lacks objectivity in that the journalist s comments are systematically aimed at reinforcing or provoking criticism of dr d.b. public confidence in a doctor s ability can be destroyed by a television programme that conveys the experiences of a few of his patients or their relatives where as in the present case all the experiences reported on are perceived negatively the opinions expressed during the programme by medical specialists suggest that the surgery performed was unnecessary or inappropriate there is no coverage of the experiences of satisfied patients and no mention of whether the surgery was of a delicate or routine nature the degree of risk each operation entailed and the number of operations carried out by the doctor during the relevant period and no information is provided as to the average failure rates of the types of surgery concerned the damage that could potentially be caused by broadcasting the programme would be exacerbated by the fact that the programme is broadcast during prime time it enjoys a serious reputation and as a result the audience will naturally be inclined to believe not only that the interviewees have objective reasons to complain about dr d.b but also that they represent a significant sample of his patients. on may the applicant company appealed on points of law against the two judgments of the court of appeal it alleged a violation of articles and of the convention and articles and of the constitution in its first ground of appeal it contended that the judgment appealed against in finding that the first paragraph of article of the constitution did not apply to television programmes had breached the provision in question it submitted that at a time when radio and television reached a much wider audience than the print media excluding the former from the scope of article of the constitution amounted to depriving that article of its essential element namely protection of the freedom to impart ideas as opposed to the instrument used for that purpose it added that while it was true that freedom to express opinions was not absolute it could not be subject to prior restraints but only to punitive measures there should at the very least have been an opportunity to express the opinion as the actual wording of article of the constitution indicated when this freedom is used the applicant company inferred from this that article did not allow the authorities to subject the free expression of opinions on any subject to prior scrutiny or to prohibit the broadcast of a television programme in advance the applicant company submitted a second ground of appeal in the alternative should it be found that article of the constitution did not prohibit all prior restraints on the exercise of freedom of expression and that article second paragraph article second paragraph and articles and of the judicial code read in conjunction with article of the convention and article of the constitution constituted a law within the meaning of article of the convention it argued that although article did not guarantee unrestricted freedom of expression even with regard to media coverage of matters of serious public concern and although the exercise of that freedom carried with it duties and responsibilities which were also applicable to the press and were liable to assume significance when there was a risk of undermining the reputation of private individuals or the rights of others the mere interest albeit undeniable of the respondent in protecting his honour and professional reputation was not sufficient to prevail over the important public interest in preserving the freedom of the press to impart information on matters of legitimate public concern in his submissions the advocate-general recommended that the court of appeal s judgments be quashed following a thorough analysis of the case-law of the court of cassation the conseil d etat and the administrative jurisdiction and procedure court cour d arbitrage he submitted that article of the constitution guaranteed freedom of expression in general which could not be hindered by prior censorship he nevertheless pointed out that such freedom was not absolute and could be limited by general restrictions prescribed by law provided that the imperative requirements of article of the convention were satisfied however the wording of that article made it impossible in his view to prohibit the dissemination of information on the basis of prior scrutiny as such a measure would impair the very essence of freedom of expression the advocate-general observed that in the particular context of freedom of expression the courts powers were limited by observance of the constitution which prohibited any preventive measure entailing prior restrictions on freedom of expression nevertheless the advocate-general added that since freedom of expression was not an absolute right it could not prevail over or negate respect for the other rights and freedoms safeguarded by the constitution and international instruments he noted in that connection that prior restrictions of a general nature could be framed in law provided that they satisfied the requirements set forth in article of the convention lastly he expressed the view that articles and of the civil code and articles and of the judicial code satisfied the accessibility and foreseeability requirements laid down by the court in a judgment of june the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law firstly it upheld the court of appeal s judgment as regards the inapplicability of article of the constitution finding that television programmes were not forms of expression by means of printed matter it held that the requirement for the applicant company to produce the recording of the programme in issue did not breach article of the constitution since the urgent-applications judge had provisionally postponed the broadcast of the programme in order to ensure effective protection of the honour reputation and private life of others it further held that articles and of the constitution articles and of the convention and articles and of the judicial code which it had interpreted consistently allowed the restrictions provided for in article of the convention and were sufficiently precise to enable anyone if need be with appropriate legal advice to foresee the legal consequences of his or her acts in particular the court of cassation held as follows under article of the constitution the judiciary is competent both to prevent and to redress unlawful infringements of civil rights similarly the judge dealing with urgent applications as in the present case is empowered under articles and of the judicial code to take any provisional measures in respect of the person responsible for such an infringement that may be necessary to protect personal rights if there are prima facie legal grounds for doing so in particular where there is a serious threat of a violation of a right the urgent-applications judge is authorised by article of the judicial code to order measures aimed at preventing such a violation. secondly the court of cassation held as follows in relation to the objection that the applicant company s second ground of appeal was inadmissible in that it had failed to allege a violation of article of the judicial code in upholding the respondent s claim the impugned judgment of march finds that the respondent ‘ has made out a sufficient prima facie case for obtaining an interim injunction prohibiting the broadcast of the programme in issue which clearly and needlessly undermines his honour and reputation the urgent-applications judge may order interim measures if there are prima facie legal grounds for doing so in merely examining the parties prima facie rights without applying legal rules that could not form a reasonable basis for the interim measures ordered by him the judge has not overstepped the limits of his powers the appellant can not challenge the court of appeal s provisional assessment unless it alleges a violation of article of the judicial code which it has not done. articles former article and of the constitution are worded as follows article freedom of worship its public practice and freedom to manifest one s opinions on all matters are guaranteed but offences committed when this freedom is used may be punished. article everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life except in the cases and conditions provided for by law article the press is free censorship can never be introduced no payment of security can be demanded of authors publishers or printers where the author is known and resident in belgium neither the publisher nor the printer nor the distributor may be prosecuted. article disputes about civil rights fall exclusively within the competence of the courts. the relevant provisions of the civil code are worded as follows article any act that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it. article everyone shall be liable for the damage he has caused not only by his own acts but also by his negligence or carelessness. articles and of the judicial code provide as follows article the interest in bringing an action must be vested and present an action may be allowed where it has been brought even for declaratory purposes with a view to preventing a violation of a right that is seriously threatened. article a judgment is final when it exhausts the jurisdiction of the court in respect of a question in dispute save for appeals provided for by law the judge may before passing judgment order a preliminary measure aimed at investigating the application or settling the parties situation on an interim basis. article the president of the court of first instance shall in respect of all matters except those which the law excludes from the jurisdiction of the courts of justice give a provisional ruling in cases which he recognises as being urgent the matter shall be brought before the president by means of an urgent application or in cases of absolute necessity an ex parte application he may among other things appoint administrators order certificates or expert reports for any purpose even including the assessment of damage and the investigation of its causes order any measures that are necessary for the protection of the rights of those who are unable to ensure such protection themselves including the sale of movable property that has been neglected or abandoned order the examination of one or more witnesses where one of the parties can show that this is of prima facie interest even with a view to future litigation provided that it is established that any delay in the hearing will necessarily prompt concerns that it will not be possible to take the evidence at a later stage. article orders for interim measures shall be made without prejudice to the merits they shall be enforceable immediately notwithstanding an application to set aside or an appeal and without payment of a security if the court has not ordered such payment if a party not appearing in court applies to have the order set aside it shall not be entitled to appeal against the order made in absentia. article the appeal on points of law of which both the original and a copy must be signed by a lawyer authorised to practise in the court of cassation shall include the appellant s grounds of appeal and submissions together with an indication of the statutory provisions alleged to have been breached failure to include any of the above shall render the appeal null and void. in a judgment of december the court of cassation held neither television programmes nor cable broadcasts are forms of expression by means of printed matter article of the constitution current article is therefore inapplicable to them. the judgment further stated although article current article of the constitution like article of the convention guarantees freedom to manifest one s opinions on any subject and accordingly does not allow the authorities to make the exercise of these freedoms subject to prior scrutiny of the opinions in question these provisions nevertheless do not safeguard this freedom to an unlimited extent and in particular do not preclude the regulation or prohibition of commercial advertising in cable television broadcasts where such regulation or prohibition is compatible with the requirements of supranational law there is no basis in law for the ground of appeal to the effect that articles and of the constitution prohibit all censorship prior authorisation or advance prohibition of the expression of a particular opinion and its dissemination by any means whatsoever article of the constitution or more specifically through the press article of the constitution in a judgment of june the court of cassation ruled on the power of the ordinary courts to prevent restrict or regulate the distribution of press publications it held that this power was in principle acceptable on the basis of article of the constitution articles and of the judicial code and article of the civil code in the case before it the urgent-applications judge had issued an injunction subsequently upheld both on an application by a third party to set it aside and on appeal ordering the withdrawal from sale of all copies of the weekly magazine ciné revue which had published notes confiscated from a judge by the chairman of a parliamentary commission of inquiry on child disappearances the court of cassation held that this did not amount to censorship because the publication had already been in circulation in an order of november the president of the brussels court of first instance held that where individual freedoms are concerned in particular freedom of expression prohibition of all preventive measures is the rule accordingly the application for an injunction banning postponing or altering a broadcast is unfounded that approach was confirmed in an order made by the same judge on may three years later in an order of november while not expressly referring to article of the convention the president of the brussels court of first instance relied on article of judicial code to justify prohibiting part of a programme from being broadcast on october an ex parte injunction prohibited a broadcast without giving any further details as to the legal basis for that decision in an order of october the brussels urgent-applications judge dismissed an application for an injunction banning a book relying in particular on articles and of the constitution and article of the convention while also noting that depending on the circumstances he would be entitled under article of the judicial code to take the necessary steps to prevent any irreparable damage several weeks later in an order of december the urgent-applications judge held that article of the judicial code in itself constituted a law within the meaning of article of the convention conversely in an order of august he held that there was no basis in belgian law as it currently stood for the judiciary to take preventive measures restricting freedom of expression in an order of february while acknowledging that it is true that no preventive measures as such exist in belgian law in this sphere television the urgent-applications judge nevertheless held again that article of the judicial code formed a sufficient basis for preventive intervention on his part conversely in an order of january the urgent-applications judge of the brussels court of first instance held that in accordance with article of the convention the belgian legal system prohibited prior restraints however six months later on june the same urgent-applications division ordered restrictions on a broadcast as a preventive measure on september the urgent-applications judge held that article of the judicial code and article of the civil code read in conjunction formed a sufficiently precise legal basis for the purposes of article of the convention on november the president of the brussels court of first instance issued an ex parte injunction prohibiting a broadcast on the basis of article of the judicial code two months later in an order of january the president of the brussels court of first instance held in complete contradiction to his previous decisions that as rightly argued by the defendant article of the judicial code is a general provision conferring jurisdiction which could not justify empowering the urgent-applications judge to take the measure sought and that the applicant is mistaken in basing the application on article of the civil code which concerns redress for existing damage he nevertheless considered that belgian law did indeed contain a law within the meaning of article of the convention namely the other individual rights and freedoms protected by law in an order of april the same judge confirmed his previous decision while taking care once again to point out that it is true that as regards restrictions on freedom of expression belgian law provides only for measures entailing retrospective sanctions two weeks later on april the urgent-applications judge found that article of the constitution by way of exception constituted the law within the meaning of article of the convention ten days later on may the same judge held that on account of the balance to be struck between respect for freedom of expression and respect for the other individual rights and freedoms protected by the law in the broadest sense these other rights and freedoms being enshrined in ‘ law could be taken to be accessible to the citizens concerned by them and framed in precise terms and their safeguarding and hence protection could be deemed to constitute restrictions prescribed by law within the meaning of article of the convention he pointed out that article of the convention article of the constitution and section of the copyright act of june were all laws for the purposes of article of the convention however less than a year later in an order of april on an ex parte application the president of the brussels court of first instance held on the basis of articles and of the constitution that the courts were precluded from taking any preventive measures in matters concerning freedom of expression a fortnight later on april the urgent-applications judge while expressly ruling out the application of article of the judicial code held that he was entitled to take preventive measures under article of the constitution and article of the convention which together constituted the law within the meaning of article of the convention in an order of september he confirmed that position and again justified his power to intervene on a preventive basis under article of the constitution and article of the convention several weeks later in an order of november the same judge relied on the two above-mentioned provisions but nevertheless added that regard should also be had to the right to protection of one s image as established by the courts and to article of the judicial code as to the means of exercising that right in the meantime in an order of october the urgent-applications judge had stated that where there was a risk of a flagrant breach of fundamental rights there was nothing to prevent the urgent-applications judge from taking interim measures however in an order of january the same urgent-applications division ruled that an application for an injunction prohibiting the publication of information from an ongoing criminal investigation was at variance with article of the constitution and declared it unfounded in a judgment of june the brussels court of first instance held that the law is formed by a combined reading of article of the judicial code which is a law conferring jurisdiction rather than a substantive law for the purposes of article of the convention and article of the convention which provides that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life his home and his correspondence after noting that on several occasions the urgent-applications judge has held that belgian domestic legislation did indeed contain a ‘ law allowing freedom of expression to be restricted for the purposes of article of the convention it nevertheless acknowledged that the reasoning in decisions supporting intervention by the urgent-applications judge is not unequivocal as regards the provisions constituting the law in an order of november the urgent-applications judge developed this argument further holding that intervention by the urgent-applications judge as a preventive measure is possible under article of the judicial code a rule of jurisdiction empowering him to intervene in any matter in conjunction with the provisions relating to the rights and freedoms which would be infringed as a result of freedom of expression such as in this instance article of the convention article of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article of the constitution and the right to protection of one s image in an order of may the brussels urgent-applications judge dismissed an application for an injunction banning a book although neither the parties nor the judge took article of the constitution or article of the convention into consideration in an order of october the urgent-applications judge observed that article of the constitution prohibited any prior restraints on freedom of expression including in audio-visual matters lastly in an order of june the brussels urgent-applications judge ruled that article which prohibits censorship was also applicable to the audio-visual media and therefore precluded the courts from taking any kind of preventive measures restricting freedom of expression in a judgment delivered on january in the case of greenpeace belgium v. baggerwerken de cloedt zoon and others the court of cassation explicitly accepted that article of the convention was in principle applicable to proceedings concerning urgent applications heard by the president of the court of first instance in accordance with article of the judicial code in a second judgment delivered on the same day the court of cassation did not give an explicit ruling on this issue but nevertheless did not declare a ground of appeal alleging a violation of article of the convention inadmissible on this account in a judgment of august the conseil d etat held that articles and of the constitution prohibited any prior scrutiny of the use of freedom of expression and freedom of the press the judgment stated as follows the provisions of the constitution relied on by the applicant articles and do not preclude the punishment of press offences or offences committed in connection with the use of freedom of expression they do however prohibit prior scrutiny of the use of these freedoms in other words where printed matter can not be distributed or opinions expressed until a public authority or other third party has determined whether they are lawful in the instant case the post office does in fact reserve the right to examine the content of certain forms of election material from the standpoint of the racism act and to refuse to distribute them where it concludes that there has been an offence whether or not it has sought the opinion of the centre for equal opportunities and combating racism it therefore carries out prior censorship freedom of the press and freedom of expression are devoid of meaning unless they are accompanied by the possibility of distributing printed matter or imparting opinions. the administrative jurisdiction and procedure court in a judgment of october on an application to set aside certain provisions of the anti-discrimination act of february the administrative jurisdiction and procedure court which became the constitutional court on may held that the prohibition of preventive measures in general and of censorship in particular meant that intervention by the courts in banning the distribution of a publication was possible only where distribution had already begun it considered that in such cases the court should ascertain whether the restriction of freedom of expression that might result from the application of section of the act of february was necessary in the specific circumstances whether it met a pressing social need and whether it was proportionate to the aim pursued by that provision in accordance with section of the act in question restrictions could therefore not be imposed on the right of citizens to express their opinions even in the polemical tone that could typify public debate on social phenomena and even where such opinions offended shocked or disturbed the state or any

the case was referred to the court as established under former article of the by the european commission of human rights the commission on march within the three-month period laid down by former articles and of the convention it originated in an application no against the republic of turkey the commission s request referred to former articles and a of the convention and to rule of the former rules of court a the object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under article of the convention

mr wildhaber president of the new court authorised the applicant s lawyer to use the turkish language in the oral proceedings rule as president of the chamber originally constituted former article of the convention and former rule in order to deal in particular with procedural matters that might arise before the entry into force of protocol no mr bernhardt acting through the registrar consulted

in consequence the registrar received the memorials of the government and the applicant on and july respectively subsequently on and september respectively the government sent documents intended to be appended to their memorial and the applicant filed an additional document concerning his claim for just satisfaction article of the convention and rule of the new rules of court after the entry into force of protocol no on november and in accordance with article thereof the case was referred to the grand chamber of the court on october mr wildhaber had decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice a single grand chamber should be constituted to hear the instant case and twelve other cases against turkey namely karataş v. turkey application no arslan v. turkey no ceylan v. turkey no okçuoğlu v. turkey no gerger v. turkey no erdoğdu and i̇nce v. turkey nos and başkaya and okçuoğlu v. turkey nos and sürek and özdemir v. turkey nos and sürek v. turkey no the grand chamber constituted for that purpose included ex officio mr r. türmen the judge elected in respect of turkey article of the convention and rule of the rules of court mr wildhaber the president of the court mrs e. palm vice-president of the court and mr j.p. costa and mr m. fischbach vice-presidents of sections article of the convention and rule and a the other members appointed to complete the grand chamber were mr a. pastor ridruejo mr g. bonello mr j. makarczyk mr p. kūris mrs f. tulkens mrs v. strážnická mr v. butkevych mr j. casadevall mrs h.s greve mr a. baka mr r. maruste and mrs s.

taken in accordance with rule on december the government notified the registry that mr f. gölcüklü had been appointed ad hoc judge rule subsequently mrs botoucharova who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case was replaced by mr k. traja the first substitute judge rule b at the invitation of the court rule the commission delegated one of its members mr h. danelius to participate in the proceedings before the grand chamber in accordance with the president s decision a hearing took place in public in the human rights building strasbourg on march the case being heard simultaneously with the case of karataş v. turkey there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr danelius mr bayraktar mr tezcan and mr özmen mr edip polat a turkish national born in is a writer and lives in diyarbakır in may he published in ankara a book entitled we made each dawn a newroz nevrozladık şafakları in an epic style he related historical episodes marked by kurdish rebel movements in turkey and gave an account with his own comments of facts relating in particular to the life of prisoners in diyarbakır prison and the ill-treatment they had allegedly been subjected to the book was republished in november on december on an application by the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court the national security court the ankara court of first instance ordered the seizure of the copies published as an interim measure in the context of a criminal investigation opened in respect of mr polat in an indictment of april the public prosecutor accused the applicant inter alia of disseminating propaganda against the territorial integrity of the state and the indivisible unity of the nation within the meaning of section of the prevention of terrorism act law no see paragraph below according to the public prosecutor mr polat s book was inspired by hatred of the turkish state and lauded kurdish separatism in reaching that conclusion he noted that both the separatist bandits of the pkk and the rebel troops of sheik said were described in the book as kurdish patriots and that the regime at the time which had put down the insurrection of had been called a fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and was alleged to have implemented an expansionist policy which had led to infringement of the kurds fundamental rights and annexation of their territory he also accused the applicant of contravening section of law no by divulging the identity of the staff of diyarbakır prison who he submitted having been presented as torturers ran the risk of reprisals and the forensic pathologists whose signatures appeared on the death certificates reproduced in the book in support of his submissions the public prosecutor quoted extracts from the book whose confiscation he also sought before the national security court the applicant denied the charges against him he expressed astonishment that he was being prosecuted on account of the republication of his book six months after it had first appeared and submitted in particular that he could not be held responsible for either the terms used in the preface signed pélesor or the quotations incorporated in the text for the rest he contended that he had done no more than comment on the problems of the population of kurdish origin on the basis of an account of actual events which had moreover been discussed in the media and commented on by various politicians he argued that the extracts quoted in the prosecution submissions had to be read in the context of the book as a whole in that connection he maintained that the use of a novelistic style meant that the book could not be seen as revealing an ideological or propagandist intention it should be possible for everything in turkey to be discussed and interpretation of history could not constitute an offence in any event it was not credible that a mere publication or the few quoted sentences could threaten the indivisibility of the state or influence readers minds to such a point that the unity of the turkish nation would be impaired mr polat likewise denied that he had denounced civil servants with the aim of turning them into targets on december the national security court found the applicant guilty of disseminating separatist propaganda within the meaning of law no in its judgment it considered separately the content of each of the six parts of the book alleged to be in breach of the law and in particular quoted substantial passages from the first two parts including the following first part in spring you were not even a seed your parents had no ‘ hélin other parents had a hélin while your grandfather had himself witnessed the destruction of other hélins without suspecting that one day his granddaughter might be given the name hélin how many times did he see other hélins running away or falling in a heap at the bayonet s point that is why years later while you are living through the reality of diyarbakır today you must also learn the history of what your forefathers lived through in the spring of so when people tell you ‘ the history of our people is one of tyranny and torture you will know what they are talking about is there not a saying which goes ‘ he who is ignorant of the past can not understand the present on february the village of piran was raided after a warrant had been issued for the arrest of ten kurdish patriots these patriots preferring to fight rather than surrender to the gendarmes shouldered their rifles and began a guerrilla campaign in the mountains the events you are witnessing all these years later began with that clash on february in the village of piran ten of sheikh said s men who were wanted for ‘ banditry refused to surrender to the gendarmes and fought back with weapons in hand this sparked off an uprising for three weeks the insurgents dominated the situation this uprising which had begun with ten people turned into a serious large-scale insurrection and spread throughout the region scarcely five years after the proclamation of the republic through the turkish national democratic revolution which has remained uncompleted it was impossible for the new administration which had taken over from the ottoman administration to resolve the kurdish problem as it had not been able to bring about the necessary democratic transformations but at the time of the revolution the kurds had been promised that their rights would be recognised and by that means had been dragged into the war against the imperialist occupation following the establishment of the turkish national assembly the kurds waited two years for the promises made about the resolution of the kurdish problem to be honoured that period of silent waiting was brought to an end by the above-mentioned uprising led by sai̇d-i̇ paloyi̇ after the proclamation of the republic as the government had not satisfied the kurds expectations the accumulated anger reached new heights and it was precisely this period of angry waiting which fuelled the insurrection by march the forces of sheikh said had surrounded diyarbakır in the meantime they had dispersed several army regiments and captured the centre of elazığ and the district of palo the insurrection which was spreading did not perhaps succeed in drawing in all kurds on account of its clan-based organisation but it did manage to mobilise a large part of the population of diyarbakır when we look at turkey as it was during the years of rebellion we see that the new state was not yet stable there was an attempt to implement an expansionist policy which involved ignoring the rights of the kurds and denying the existence of their territory which the government wanted to annex there was no doubt that the insurrection of saidi paloyi begun in those circumstances would be bloodily repressed by the fundamentalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie this first event formed part of the reality of diyarbakır it lasted three months the insurrection which had found some support around diyarbakır and in the villages and districts of elazığ had finally reached the centre of diyarbakır the old people still alive today who witnessed this event say that after the insurrection was put down about forty people were tried by independence courts martial i̇stiklâl mahkemeleri and executed mr mazhar müfit the president of the court martial which convicted and ordered the execution of a number of eminent kurds including saidi paloyi spoke as follows after pronouncing sentence ‘ you have all pursued a specific objective namely establishment of an independent kurdistan and in order to bring that about some of you abused one group of the population for your own shameful interests while others among you allowed yourselves to be guided by your political ambitions and to be influenced by provocations which originated abroad. it was not on the manes of the horses of the fallen that the killers wiped their sabres clean those who climbed the scaffold kicked away the chairs under their feet themselves the others were killed by cannonballs fired from the walls when the streets of amed were awash with blood the walls were tinted ash-grey that is how the townspeople came to wear the armband with the three black dots when you were not even a droplet of life when we did not even know whether you would be born in a prison cell as a kurdish girl that is when the seed of the hatred which was to explode fifty-five years later was sown… second part they forbade us to call you ‘ hélin they insisted that we call you ‘ meral on your birth certificate they ordered us to write ‘ meral like the name of your country your first name was proscribed… it was at that time that the commando raids on the villages of the province of diyarbakır began thousands of villagers were crushed under the soldiers rifle butts the men of the villages were exhibited stark naked to their wives daughters and daughters-in-law during operations conducted under the pretext of searching for weapons dozens of villagers were beaten to death … the age-old hatred grew deeper the official files contained reports about how the people of the region had rebelled against tyranny everything that had happened before was known about besides isn t there a saying ‘ crush the serpent s head while it is still small however the ‘ serpent had grown and begun to bite there had to be an explanation of the secret of this seedling because the more it was cut back the more it budded battle was engaged between the ‘ irreconcilable opposites… in the fighting which had until then been rather clan-based reached a higher level like those in the ‘ opposite camp who had put their organisation in order the revolutionary fighters on their side amalgamated the national struggle with the struggle between social classes breaking out from the regional and clan context the kurdish problem moved on towards a common front with class war socialism became the problem of the kurds and the kurdish question that of the socialists… the national security court after rehearsing the historical facts that had led to the events referred to by mr polat ruled that he had given an inexact version of them it emphasised that the turkish state was a single entity that its territory formed a whole and that all its nationals without exception were patriots it went on to say that it was unacceptable to describe as patriots insurgents who had caused the death of thousands of troops it was not true that within turkey there was a kurdish territory or a turkish territory it flew in the face of the facts to give the name kurdistan to a region where citizens of various origins lived and that by going so far as to say that the state of the republic of turkey was expansionist and colonialist mr polat had supported the assertion that there were two nations the kurdish nation whose history had allegedly been marked by tyranny and torture and the turks who were enslavers in the court s view such assertions were unacceptable because they encouraged separatism and the dismemberment of the nation on the subject of the second part of the book the court observed even the opening phrase ‘ like the name of your country your first name was proscribed suggested separatism. it ruled that by discussing the prohibition of the forename hélin the author had intended to allude to the ban on the name kurdistan mr polat had tried to conceal in that way his real intention which had been to assert the existence of a separate country within the territory of the turkish state the court said that during the periods when democracy had been suspended and the army was in power there had been restrictions on certain rights and freedoms and undesirable incidents such as gathering villagers together with a view to collecting hidden weapons had taken place while it was conceivable that from time to time it had been necessary to use force against people who refused to hand over their weapons it was unacceptable for mr polat to present such incidents as acts of torture which had exclusively affected the peasants of diyarbakır thus insinuating that one group of turkish citizens were victims of discriminatory treatment in fact it was mr polat s very approach which constituted discrimination based on region of origin and ethnic considerations as for the other parts of the book the national security court held in the third part the allegations which the author attempts to back up by giving the names of prison staff that repression has become the destiny of the kurdish people and that people of kurdish origin have been imprisoned and tortured to death on account of their struggle for independence are not credible and merely take advantage of people s feelings remarks like those to the effect that the consciousness of nationhood has been strengthened by the inhuman treatment of the kurdish people and that the national struggle is a noble one amount to nothing more than separatist propaganda in the fourth part it is stated that in the prisons female prisoners were woken up in the middle of the night and falsely told that there was a fire but that their fear suddenly transformed itself into a marriage ceremony and they then began to shout out cries of joy tilili the memory of persons who had committed suicide on the evening of may is evoked in such a way as to exploit people s feelings in describing as heroic certain acts inspired by a primitive oriental mentality in choosing to see a simple cry as a marriage ceremony and in presenting suicides as heroic acts the intention can only be to bolster kurdish nationalist sentiment it is obvious that conditions in prison are not ideal however by using demagogic language the defendant misrepresented those conditions to a considerable extent as if they were being used to repress the sacred and noble rebellion of the kurdish people subjected to tyranny and torture such assertions amount to separatist propaganda in the fifth part the defendant discusses certain traditions and customs to which turks and kurds attach importance or a symbolic value he relates among others the following anecdote ‘ according to legend during dersim s rebellion government soldiers burned a village while the village was on fire a child of eight to ten years of age who had escaped from the flames ran up and threw himself into the arms of the soldiers standing round the fire when he suddenly caught sight of the earth-coloured uniforms the child preferred to throw himself into the flames than to stay where he was so he ran back to where he had come from and jumped into the fire the kurds have never throughout history been able to establish a lasting state and their quest for freedom has transformed itself in their hearts into glowing embers that is why the fire of newroz is in fact the fire of their desire for freedom kurdish society is based on a population which has existed for thousands of years in the course of history it remained under the influence of a number of religions languages and cultures every society goes through certain phases and when it moves from one to another some of its customs and traditions live on that is perfectly natural however the defendant likens the fires lit in the mountains during the newroz celebrations to the fire of freedom in people s hearts whereas in turkish society too there are events at which fires are lit that does not mean that the turkish people or the kurdish people intoxicate themselves with the fire of freedom to claim that the kurds are not free is to attribute to them a demand for freedom but what would follow freedom for the kurds is division of the territory and the nation it is precisely that outcome which the author implicitly advocates and seeks as for the legend related by the defendant it constitutes clear and conclusive proof of hostility towards the turks in the sixth part the defendant speaks of prisons and the resistance movements inside them we will not examine each of these movements a full account of them has already been given in the bulletins and statements put out by the pkk among the prisoners there are also members of the pkk s central committee and other leading members we know that when the prosecutors of the military legal service drew up the indictments calling for application of the death penalty a movement of panic sprang up and that to calm the situation down the pkk militants in order to arouse so-called resistance movements used people they had conditioned by saying to them ‘ behold the fascist turkish republic which oppresses you you are treated like soldiers they wake you up at the same time as them they make you take part in sport and they force you to go to sleep at fixed times moreover with regard to m.d who according to the defendant committed suicide even his friends in prison confirmed that he had killed himself after a period of depression furthermore did not one ş.r.g decide to commit suicide in diyarbakır prison when suffering from depression he dressed himself in thick clothes stuffed them with cotton soaked in eau-de-cologne and then set fire to them with a match when his clothes began to burn his skin he started to shout out and call to the other prisoners for help when they had saved him he told those around him how much he regretted what he had done and that he realised how stupid he had been in fact suicides in prisons are committed as a result of depression originating in a feeling of guilt about offences committed misrepresenting all these facts the defendant portrays pkk members as innocent freedom fighters and their resistance as legitimate and just thus making manifest his criminal intent. in short according to the national security court it was clearly and incontestably established that mr polat had disseminated propaganda against the territorial integrity of the republic of turkey and the indivisible unity of the nation which justified sentencing him pursuant to section of law no to two years imprisonment and a fine of million turkish liras trl it held however that although the facts of the case also constituted an offence under section of law no it was not necessary regard being had to article of the criminal code see paragraph below to pronounce sentence separately in respect of that offence in adition the national security court ordered the confiscation of all the editions of the book the applicant appealed to the court of cassation in his statement of the grounds of appeal he submitted that his intention had never been to work towards separatist ends but to set out his thoughts in a critical spirit about real events relating to the kurdish question he contended that the possibility of conducting such an exercise was an indispensable precondition for democracy and freedom of thought he further asserted that the judges at first instance had wrongly based their judgment on their own interpretation of historical events or their own perception of what was allegedly implicit he argued that the national security court had been inconsistent in accepting on the one hand that there was such a thing as kurdish society while denying on the other the possibility that this society might have its own patriotic feelings epics legends and demands for freedom in any event such questions were matters for sociologists or historians not judges the national security court s approach had therefore been more political than legal and was bound to have led to an unfair judgment after a hearing the court of cassation dismissed mr polat s appeal by a judgment of may holding that the assessment of the evidence by the first-instance court had been consistent with the reasons it had given for rejecting the applicant s defence in july mr polat was imprisoned on his release in january he paid the fine of trl that had been imposed on him on october law no of october came into force this reduced the terms of imprisonment prescribed by section of law no but increased the fines it laid down see paragraph below in a temporary provision relating to section law no also made provision for automatic re-examination of sentences pronounced in judgments rendered pursuant to section of law no see paragraph below in accordance with that provision the national security court re-examined the merits of the applicant s case by a judgment of december the text of which reproduced to a considerable extent the wording of the judgment of december see paragraph above it finally sentenced mr polat to pay an additional fine of trl and confirmed the order for the confiscation of his book on appeal by the applicant the court of cassation upheld that decision by a judgment of may on august mr polat complying with an order to pay that had been served on him paid the additional fine the relevant provisions of the criminal code are worded as follows article where the legislative provisions in force at the time when a crime is committed are different from those of a later law the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied. article in the event of conviction the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence… article a person who commits an act which contravenes more than one provision of the law shall be punished pursuant to the article of those relevant that lays down the heaviest penalty. law no of april on the prevention of acts of terrorism was amended by law no of october which came into force on october see paragraph below the relevant sub-sections of sections and provide section it shall be an offence punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million turkish liras to announce orally or in the form of a publication that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person whether or not that person s identity is divulged provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. former section written and spoken propaganda meetings assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the republic of turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited irrespective of the methods used and the intention any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million turkish liras. new section written and spoken propaganda meetings assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the republic of turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million turkish liras the penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. among the amendments it makes to section of law no with regard to minimum and maximum sentences see paragraph above the law of october contains a temporary provision relating to section worded as follows in the month following the entry into force of the present law the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section of the prevention of terrorism act law no and in accordance with the amendment to section of law no shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections and of law no of july the relevant parts of section of the execution of sentence act law no read as follows the term ‘ fine shall mean payment to the treasury of a sum fixed within the statutory limits … if after service of the order to pay the convicted person does not pay the fine within the time-limit he shall be committed to prison for a term of one day for every ten thousand turkish liras owed by a decision of the public prosecutor … the sentence of imprisonment thus substituted for the fine may not exceed three years… the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure concerning the admissible grounds for appeals on points of law against judgments at first instance are worded as follows article an appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness. article unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases where the court is not established in accordance with the law where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating … the government supplied copies of six decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the istanbul national security court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility especially on religious grounds article of the criminal code and of five others withdrawing charges against persons suspected of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the state section of the prevention of terrorism act law in three of these cases where the offences had been committed by means of publications the prosecutor based his decision on the fact that there was no evidence of some of the constituent elements of the offence furthermore the government submitted a number of decisions of the national security courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty these were the judgments of november no and december no march no june no october no october no and december no and january no february no march no april no and june no in the judgments against the authors of works dealing with the kurdish problem the national security courts reached their decisions on account of the absence of propaganda a constituent element of the offence mr polat applied to the commission on november he alleged that his conviction on account of the publication of his book constituted a violation of article of the convention in addition he complained that confiscation of the copies of the book breached article of protocol no on june the commission declared the application no admissible in its report of december former article of the convention it expressed the opinion by thirty-one votes to one that there had been a violation of article examined together with article and that no separate issue arose under article of protocol no unanimously the full text of the commission s opinion and of the partly dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment in his memorial the applicant asked the court to hold that there had been violations of articles and of the convention and complained in substance of a violation of article he also requested the court to award him just satisfaction under article and to order the respondent state to declare his conviction null and void and return the confiscated books to him in their memorial the government asked the court to dismiss mr polat s application in support of their arguments they also

the case originated in an application no against the kingdom of norway lodged on september with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by bergens tidende a norwegian newspaper and two norwegian nationals mr einar eriksen the newspaper 's former editor-in-chief and mrs berit kvalheim a journalist employed by the paper the applicants the applicants complained that a judgment by the norwegian supreme court in defamation proceedings instituted by a cosmetic surgeon requiring them to pay him approximately norwegian kroner damages and costs plus interest had unjustifiably interfered with their right to freedom of expression under article of the convention on october the commission second chamber decided to give notice of the application to the norwegian government the government and invited them to submit their observations on its admissibility and merits the government submitted their observations on december and june to which the applicants replied on march and august respectively following the entry into force of protocol no to the convention on november and in accordance with the provisions of article thereof the application was examined by the court the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule mrs h.s greve the judge elected in respect of withdrew from sitting in the case rule the government accordingly appointed mr s. evju to sit as an ad hoc judge article of the convention and rule by a decision of june the chamber declared the application admissible furthermore the chamber decided to hold a hearing in accordance with rule the registrar received the applicants claim for just satisfaction on september and the government 's comments on october on and october respectively she received the government 's and the applicants pre-hearing briefs the hearing took place in the public in the on november there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by mr ryssdal and mr lorentzen for the applicants and mr elgesem for the government and also their replies to questions put by the court and by several of its members individually on and november the government and the applicants variously produced additional observations and documents in response to certain questions put at the hearing moreover on and december the applicants and the government filed additional observations in the light of the court 's judgment in another case the first applicant bergens tidende is a daily newspaper published in and is the largest regional newspaper of the norwegian west coast the second applicant mr einar eriksen is its former editorinchief and the third applicant mrs berit kvalheim is a journalist employed by the newspaper they were born in and respectively and both live in dr r. is a specialist in cosmetic surgery and received his training at in in the as from he worked in this field from his privately owned practice in on march following the opening of a new clinic by dr r. bergens tidende published an article prepared by the third applicant which described dr r. 's work and the advantages of cosmetic surgery subsequently the newspaper was contacted by a number of women who had undergone such operations by dr r. and who were dissatisfied with the treatment received on may bergens tidende published on its front page a text entitled beautification resulted in disfigurement which included the following passage 'we paid thousands of norwegian kroner nok and the only thing we 've achieved is to be disfigured and ruined for life bergens tidende has spoken with three women who have an almost identical story to tell about their experiences at a cosmetic surgery clinic in all three underwent breast surgery at the clinic and the results were extremely bad they are warning other women. the caption under a photograph of a woman 's bust read this woman was tormented by her large breasts surgery resulted in disfiguring scars and a disproportionate bust. the inside of the paper contained together with a large colour photograph showing a woman 's breasts with disfiguring scars the following article women ruined for life after 'cosmetic surgery' these are the statements of three different women interviewed by bergens tidende all of them aged between and and resident in share in common the fact that they have undergone cosmetic breast surgery performed by dr r. one of two specialists in plastic surgery with a private practice in the three women who wish to remain anonymous describe their ordeal as nightmarish they all have internal and external scarring which they will have to live with for the rest of their lives swollen bust squirting prosthesis the doctor 's receptionist finally managed to get in touch with dr r. on the telephone in explained the gravity of the situation and made him travel directly from the airport to his office the night he returned home the woman 's husband sat in the waiting-room listening to her cries of pain the whole treatment took thirteen minutes and there was no talk of a rest afterwards it was just a case of getting up from the operating table and walking out three months sick-leave 'he gave us the feeling the whole time that we were an inconvenience and were taking up his precious time it took a long while for the woman to recover from her traumatic experience she had to report sick and was away from work for three months her husband too was obliged to apply for leave from his job to stay at home with her for a period of time during this time she had a prosthesis in only one breast and despite the daunting experiences she had been through she contacted dr r. again to have a silicon implant inserted in the empty breast this was repeatedly postponed and she finally decided to terminate her relationship as a client of dr r. and contact another plastic surgeon in doing so she demanded her money back for the unsuccessful operation and after some discussion he agreed to reimburse half of the costs no receipt he did so with the following comment i hope now that we are finished with one another for good you have never been a patient here and i have never seen you since then the woman has also reacted to the financial side of dr r. 's activities she had been informed beforehand that she would have to present the money nok in cash on the day of the operation even a cheque would be unacceptable and she was not given a receipt painful infection a woman tells a similar story disfiguring scars the infection that occurred immediately after the operation caused the stitches to open and septic sores developed once the wounds had healed she was left with abnormally large disfiguring scars which prompted her to contact dr r. again and ask for the damage to be repaired he agreed to do so and a new operation was scheduled the woman who had asked for three days off work in connection with the surgery arrived at the agreed time but found the doors to the clinic locked she returned home with the matter unresolved when she called him privately later that day he was impertinent and threatened her directly and the conversation ended with him slamming down the receiver the woman said after this she gave up and she has not had any contact with the doctor since waste this woman too says that she was asked to pay cash and was not given any form of receipt deformed the third woman interviewed by bergens tidende had a similar experience the woman says i had a breast augmentation done and the very first day after the operation i discovered that something was wrong with one of my breasts it was uneven pointed to the right and was rock-hard and sore it 's still hard and uneven almost two years later i feel completely deformed and i dare not even think of showing myself on a beach for example complications this woman too experienced complications after surgery chiefly in the form of constantly recurring so-called 'capsules i.e part of the prosthesis hardened and had to be broken up again she is also deeply shocked about what she feels is the offhand and nonchalant way in which she was treated on her first visit to the doctor 's bitter regrets unbearable the woman has made no effort to get back the money she paid i could n't bear the thought of fighting because i knew it would be a struggle almost two years have passed since the calamitous surgery but she has not yet been able to collect herself sufficiently after the frightening experience and contact another doctor to have her breasts operated on again articles similar to the one of may quoted above accompanied by large colour photographs were published on and may describing in detail how women had experienced their situation after allegedly failed operations and a lack of care and follow-up by dr r. some of the articles invited women to complain to the health authorities and to institute proceedings against the doctor one article stated that the health directorate helsedirektoratet would commence an investigation that dr r. might lose his licence to practise and that the question of a police investigation had been raised brief summaries of the contents of the articles may be found in the judgment of march of the norwegian supreme court høyesterett quoted in paragraph below in an editorial of may entitled medical power bergens tidende stated it is of course with satisfaction that we see health authorities now carry out a thorough investigation of the activities which the breast doctor has been performing for many years this is the least that one could expect it must be in the interest of all the patient 's the authorities and also the doctor 's to have clarified whether the methods of treatment applied meet professional standards the fact that the case has serious implications also because it has aesthetic moral but also basically down-to-earth economic consequences serves to underline the need for a thorough investigation it is nevertheless a puzzle that it took a whole series of newspaper articles powerful notices and assertive journalism to make the medical health bureaucracy react complaints to the doctors own professional association have not produced results and neither the regional nor the municipal health authorities have taken any initiative before the patients in despair came out with their stories of suffering to bergens tidende again one wonders what is required in order to break down the strong professional ties within the medical profession and to preserve the interests of patients in any event it justifies the reflection that patients over many years feel threatened by fear of 'reprisals irrespective of whether this fear is imaginary or real it is telling of the relationship of power which still exists between doctors and patients breaking down the myths and building confidence are crucial conditions for the process of healing therefore it is important to have a full clarification of the case in all its dimensions unfortunately the initiative for this investigation does not originate from the medical milieu but from the weakest party the patient. on may bergens tidende had also produced at the bottom of the page containing the impugned article mentioned in paragraph above an article containing an interview with dr gunnar johnsen plastic surgeon at a bergen hospital entitled demanding form of surgery small margins between success and failure it stated information is important technically demanding the issue of may also contained an interview with dr r. entitled there will always be dissatisfied patients which read it is dr r. who states this to bergens tidende in his comments to the complaints from the three women according to the third applicant 's statement to the high court in the proceedings mentioned below when approaching dr r. in connection with the above interview she had invited him to comment on the three women 's allegations and had informed him that they had given their consent to release him from his duty of confidentiality he had replied that he was bound by his general duty of medical confidentiality which applied irrespective of whether the patient had given such consent dr r. in those proceedings denied the third applicant 's version of the facts stating that he was absolutely sure that she had not informed him that the patients had lifted his duty of secrecy on may bergens tidende published two articles commenting on the critical articles published earlier that month in the first article entitled the press the pillory of today ms k. thue recalled the history of witch-hunts during the middle ages and described bergens tidende 's coverage of the accounts by dr r. 's dissatisfied patients as a modern form of witch-hunt conducted by the press she stated that the doctor was unable to reply being prevented by his duty of secrecy he could not refer to the large group of patients who were satisfied and could not substantiate that they constituted the vast majority of patients the second article written by mr r. steinsvik and entitled there are always two sides to a case stated we are concerned with the recent focusing on dr r. 's business we are a group of thirty persons who all have in common that we are or have been patients of dr r. we are satisfied with the treatment received not least the service and care provided during post-surgery treatment and follow-up a case always has two sides and by these words we hope that we have conveyed our views on and experiences of this doctor. following the publication of the articles by bergens tidende seventeen former patients submitted complaints against dr r. to the health authorities on october mr eskeland the medical expert appointed to evaluate the situation concluded that there was no reason to criticise dr r. 's surgical treatment of the patients mr eskeland stated that the complications complained of were common in surgery and were bound to occur from time to time but were not due to shortcomings in dr r. 's surgery in one case he criticised dr r. for having travelled abroad without informing a relatively newly operated patient mr eskeland observed that in the light of the large number of patients treated by dr r. approximately between and the number of complaints had been moderate bearing in mind that the articles published by bergens tidende had invited dr r. 's former patients to complain it was surprising that not more patients had done so on november the health directorate decided not to take any further action finding that dr r. had not performed improper surgery after the publication of the newspaper articles dr r. received fewer patients and experienced financial difficulties he had to close down his business in april in the meantime on june dr r. instituted defamation proceedings against the applicants claiming damages by judgment of april the bergen city court ordered the applicants to pay dr r. a total of nok in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages and costs the court considered that dr r. 's economic loss would amount to several million kroner and that an assessment had to be made on a discretionary basis it observed that while the criticism against dr r. had been made in an unjustified manner destroying the public 's confidence in him as a surgeon the criticism had been caused mainly by his own conduct the court deemed it appropriate to make an award corresponding to less than the amounts claimed the applicants and dr r. appealed against the judgment to the gulating high court lagmannsrett which found for the applicants stating inter alia after hearing the evidence the high court finds that the articles give an essentially correct rendering of the women 's experiences as they themselves lived through them as witnesses they gave the impression to some extent that the newspapers had moderated their accounts the high court finds them credible and finds no reason to believe that their subjective experiences are not commensurate with what objectively took place in other words they had reasonable grounds for feeling the way they did and as described by the newspaper the high court does not exclusively base itself on these three women 's statements it finds it also proven that the newspaper was contacted by a number of other women giving similar stories subsequently after the article of may had been published together with an appeal by n.h. to women to join in filing an action many more women got in touch the high court finds it established that the number of women who did so was more than one hundred this is based mainly on statements taken from the second and third applicants and n.h. and some of these women have also appeared as witnesses before the high court and have given statements these constitute only a minor part of all the women who contacted bergens tidende and n.h. a total of fourteen dissatisfied women have given statements as has the husband of one woman however it is largely the same story that is repeated again and again in the statements complications did occur or the result was bad and the follow-up treatment provided by dr r. was felt to be unsatisfactory and seemed rushed with little interest some irritation and unwillingness several women told how dr r. seemed insensitive to their mental as well as physical pain and discomfort some had the feeling that dr r. would rather be finished with them after he had operated and had not organised post-operative treatment properly some of the women were worried that dr r. might not have given them proper post-operative treatment what is also being repeated by many of the women is that they were struck by the fact that dr r. was keen when it came to the financial side he wanted payment in advance was unwilling to take cheques and gave no receipt unless especially asked to do so on the basis of the above the high court finds it proven that dr r. ran his practice in such a way that many of the women who suffered complications had experiences that gave them reasonable grounds to feel themselves exposed to poor care and to feel anxiety about the treatment they were given and in several instances had reason to feel offended by dr r. 's behaviour moreover the high court finds that the experiences described in the article of may are representative of those made by many other women thus the high court finds that the three women referred to in the article of may had not been especially sensitive and had not had exaggerated expectations but that their stories were sober and reasonably subjective accounts of what had happened having regard to the information at hand about complaints made by other women the high court also finds that this is not simply a case of one or two odd exceptions as far as dr r. is concerned it can reasonably be established that it is a question of unsatisfactory behaviour which occurred quite often in the cases where something happened to necessitate an extra effort after the operations that is not to say that he behaved in an unsatisfactory way in most cases or in a particularly large number of them it is hardly a question of more than a minority of the cases and it must be stressed that nothing has been said to prove that there really was a failure as regards r. 's surgical competence but the fact that the unsatisfactory behaviour occurred in a number of cases must provide a basis for allowing criticism of dr r. to come to light in the newspaper reference is made to what has been said above about the right of the general public and the consumer to be kept informed and their right to react by staying away to be on the safe side it should be pointed out that the people who contacted the newspaper at the outset did so as a reaction to bergens tidende 's article on march an article which presented a picture of r. 's business without mentioning the drawbacks bergens tidende claims that in view of the article of march it felt obliged to let their criticism be heard which the high court finds very understandable on may bergens tidende ran an article in which n.h. described her own experience of treatment at dr r. 's clinic and urged women in a similar situation to join forces in suing the doctor the high court finds it proven in the same way as for the three women who were described on may that n.h. 's experiences were recounted correctly and that her subjective feelings were reasonably grounded on what had occurred the same applies to what was stated on may about the experience of a lady the high court is also satisfied that what was stated on the same day about telephone calls to n.h. 'storm of telephone calls is correct as far as the rendering of the women 's experiences is concerned what was stated in bergens tidende is thus in all essentials correct and their subjective experiences were liable to give a picture of how treatment by dr r. could turn out not only in rare exceptional cases the striking part about the statements that dr r. has challenged is that they report in strong language on the results of treatment provided by dr r. 'disfigurement 'ruined for life 'mutilated and the like it is sufficiently clear that the statements are here describing the result of dr r. 's treatment but there is nothing in the statements suggesting a lack of surgical ability on dr r. 's part and one must assume that newspaper readers were aware that a poor result of an operation need not be due to a lack of surgical skill it has been submitted that the use of expressions like 'ruined 'was disfigured etc. brings to mind actions that are aimed at ruining and disfiguring and that the reader is therefore immediately made to believe that some person i.e dr r. is guilty of such conduct the high court does not find that from a linguistic point of view the statements apply to anything other than the purely objective result another question is whether the statements are misleading because they give the impression that the consequences were more serious than they actually were the high court can not see that this is the case especially when bearing in mind that it is the manner of reporting of the women 's subjective opinions which is at stake 'disfigured means having an ugly mark of some significance on one 's body and in the opinion of the high court the women who use this expression according to bergens tidende had good reason for doing so much the same can be said about 'mutilated presumably 'ruined must be understood as bearing a somewhat stronger expression but must be justified in the case of women whose breasts have large scars or have become lopsided hard different or tender to touch in view of the effect this must have had not only on the woman 's relationship with her husband but also in many other respects one can imagine what it must mean not to be able to give one 's child or grandchild a hug because of tender or hard breasts according to what the court finds established on the witness evidence it was amongst other elements against the background of such results that the newspaper had used the expressions while the statements thus could not be said to amount to a direct allegation that dr r. lacked surgical abilities bergens tidende did not make it clear either that there was no lack of ability and both the individual statements and the articles in their entirety give the impression that it is being questioned whether dr r. always provided treatment which was medically up to standard in the light of the women 's information however this was a natural question to ask several of the women mentioned it and anyone who reads the accounts alone would be inclined to ask that question it can therefore not be unlawful for bergens tidende to air this question dr r. also complains that bergens tidende conducted a veritable campaign and persecution against him the high court does not consider this to be the case in particular the newspaper should have the right to believe that women should think twice about consulting dr r. and to write articles with this in mind in brief the opinion of the high court can be summarised as follows in dr r. 's practice there were a not inconsiderable number of cases of poor followup and behaviour and the like which gave many women reasonable grounds for feeling disappointed and badly treated the high court bases this assessment of evidence essentially on the women 's statements and comportment in court bergens tidende was entitled to write about this and to repeat the women 's subjective experiences of the treatment the newspaper did this in a manner which in all essentials was correct in so far as the newspaper articles might have given the impression that there could be reason to question dr r. 's professional ability this was no more than a suspicion for which his behaviour gave reasonable grounds and which it must therefore have been right to report on if this led to financial losses for dr r. it was because of the extremely sensitive nature of the activities he was engaged in the applicants are therefore discharged from liability to pay damages and the high court will not go into the question of the extent of dr r. 's financial losses moreover the high court does not find it possible to allow the claim for non-pecuniary damage and referring to what has been stated above does not find that any of the coverage of dr r. by bergens tidende was unlawful. dr r. appealed against the above judgment to the supreme court in his submission the city court 's judgment was in principle correct except that no reduction should have been made of the award on grounds of shortcomings on his part in his opinion even if the high court 's assessment of the evidence concerning lack of care and follow-up were to be accepted this could only have a marginal effect on the amount of compensation he maintained inter alia that the newspaper articles had amounted to a public execution of him as a plastic surgeon by their strong emphasis on unsuccessful operations and by giving the readers the impression that he was incompetent furthermore he had not been given a proper opportunity to reply to the criticism before the publications were printed in his view the defendants conduct had been grossly negligent the applicants emphasised that the impugned news coverage concerned above all the situation of quite a large number of women with whom the newspaper had been in contact directly or indirectly and who had complained about lack of care and follow-up after unsuccessful operations they had also complained about a lack of information before the operations the articles conveyed the women 's feelings and frustrations as expressed in their own words whether dr r. was a good or a bad surgeon had not been decisive on december the appeals selection committee kjæremålsutvalget of the supreme court dismissed the appeal in so far as it concerned the high court 's assessment of the evidence relating to the issue of dr r. 's lack of care and follow-up of his patients and allowed the appeal for the remainder to proceed in a judgment of march the supreme court found in favour of dr r. and awarded him amounts totalling nok in respect of damages and costs mr justice backer stated inter alia on behalf of a unanimous court by way of introduction i note that newspapers of course have a right to emphasise questionable aspects of cosmetic surgery and to illustrate their presentation with information about unfortunate incidents they should also be able to pinpoint critical aspects of an individual surgeon 's business and here the journalist in question must be granted a wide leeway for subjective considerations but outright incorrect factual information of a negative character must be considered defamatory the fact that the newspaper just repeats the accusations made by others will according to established case-law not in principle constitute a defence accordingly it will be necessary to consider the individual articles in order to establish their contents in relation to the rules on defamation in interpreting the articles one should take as a starting-point the impression which they as a whole will make on the ordinary reader while attaching greater weight to the headlines and the introductions than to the text presented in normal characters the high court considered that the particularly interested reader would read the entire news report meticulously and thereby obtain a more balanced view than the reader who only takes a cursory look at the news report i find it difficult to attach particular importance to this consideration even those who read the news report as a whole would easily be influenced by value judgments in headlines etc furthermore the news report addresses the general public and will thus affect the doctor 's reputation as such unlike the high court i can not see that one can generally assume that readers would be aware that a bad result of an operation is not necessarily due to a lack of surgical skills the news report of may was based on the positive articles of march and the comments the newspaper had received from dissatisfied patients it describes the situation of three women who had undergone a breast operation involving silicon implants and who had subsequently experienced problems on page one there is a two-column headline 'beautification resulted in disfigurement followed by a picture of a woman 's breasts disfigured by scars in quotation marks it reads 'we paid thousands of kroner and the only thing we 've achieved is to be disfigured and ruined for life inside the newspaper an entire page is reserved for the news report there is a headline covering seven columns 'women ruined for life after cosmetic surgery the same picture as on the front page is printed over five columns below the picture it is written 'enormous scars wrinkled breasts and a long painful inflammation were the consequences of the cosmetic surgery on this woman the article commences with three points in bold print which read in the article it appears from the women 's statements that they contacted dr r. following an inflammation and other complications and that they were unhappy with the treatment they received i understand this to relate both to the service and the result of the treatment at the bottom of the page there is an interview with dr r. with the headline 'there will always be dissatisfied patients in the course of the proceedings it has been submitted that the third applicant had contacted dr r. on april and had asked him to comment stating that the three women had told her that they had released dr r. from his obligation to observe professional secrecy however referring to this obligation dr r. had refused to comment on specific cases at the bottom of the page there is furthermore an interview with another specialist in cosmetic surgery with the headline 'demanding form of surgery small margins between success and failure the following day on may a new article appeared on the front page a headline covering two columns reads 'action against the breast doctor inside the newspaper there is a headline covering five columns 'institute proceedings against the doctor it is the former patient n.h. who appears and explains about experiences similar to the three women from the articles published the day before she invites everybody in the same situation to get together in a case against dr r. there is also an interview with the chief county physician fylkeslegen who states that dissatisfied patients may complain to him furthermore there is an article covering five columns with the headline 'the doctor must provide receipts here the complaint is made that dr r. allegedly requested payment without providing receipts therefor it is indicated that this might interest both the tax authorities and the social authorities in the article of may the front page contains a one-column headline 'nok breasts ruined the headline is repeated over seven columns inside the newspaper with a small amendment without importance to its contents here a woman explains how she underwent two breast operations by dr r. with a bad result further there is a headline covering four columns 'control virtually impossible followed by an article in which the chief county tax inspector fylkesskattesjefen is interviewed covering two columns there is a framed article with the headline 'telephone storm to the extent i could not sleep it is n.h. who recalls how she received telephone calls from a number of women who recounted very 'strong stories about their experiences with dr r. in the articles of may this is followed up the front page shows a headline covering four columns 'telephone storm from the persons operated on furthermore there is a picture covering two columns of one of the breasts of a former patient g.s. where the point is that the stitches were not removed in addition to disfiguring scars inside the newspaper there is a headline covering five columns 'telephone storm following criticism against fashion doctor had no idea we were so many n.h. recalls in an interview that she has talked to at least fifty persons who all have frightening experiences to contribute three of these cases are explained further there is a threecolumn picture of g.s 's breasts connected thereto is a four-column headline g.s was operated on in the stitches are still there the article explains that she contacted dr r. 's office after the operation in order to have the stitches removed but was told to do this herself as a pair of appropriate pincers was not available further there is an article with the headline covering three columns 'probably no investigation in which the state prosecutor is interviewed in the last articles of may the front page contains a headline covering four columns 'breast doctor is being investigated it is stated that according to the acting health director the health directorate would immediately contact the chief county physician in order to carry out a thorough investigation of dr r. and his practice and the newspaper draws attention to the question whether the doctor may lose his licence inside the newspaper there is a four-column headline related to the same operation furthermore there is a similar headline can not do anything advokat å.h of the norwegian doctors association tells the newspaper that the association can not examine complaints about the doctor 's medical practice but only complaints which relate to the doctor 's behavioural and humane treatment of patients the first question which arises when evaluating the series of articles is whether the criticism of dr r. may be characterised as an accusation and what its contents may be on the one hand dr r. maintains that he is accused of malpractice and that insufficiencies in respect of his work as a surgeon will be of central importance the defendants maintain on the other hand that the criticism does not concern this but relates to a lack of information care and follow-up treatment which is a part of the medical treatment the high court found that evidence had been submitted proving that deficiencies in care and follow-up treatment had occurred since the appeal concerning the evaluation of evidence on this point has been refused the supreme court is bound by the evaluation made by the high court the articles concern the situation of women who have experienced complications after an operation or when the original operation failed they are in despair due to the result of the treatment and complain about the reluctance and carelessness on the part of dr r. as regards rectifying what went wrong in my opinion the articles in the newspaper appear at the same time to be a strong attack on dr r. 's qualifications as a cosmetic surgeon without taking sufficiently into account the usual risk of unsuccessful operations the statements that the women were disfigured and ruined for life and the many other strong statements in particular in the articles of may which set the tone for the other articles can hardly be understood otherwise than as referring to a great extent to the result of the treatment where the surgical element is essential this is also how the chief county physician the health directorate and professor e. understood the articles initially it appears that the newspaper was of the same opinion in an editorial of may satisfaction is accordingly expressed with the fact that the health authorities would now make a thorough examination of a 'breast doctor from in order to 'clarify whether the methods of treatment which are used comply with professional standards since it must have been apparent that the articles would completely destroy his business it may also be questioned whether the newspaper 's series of articles concerning dr r. could be explained in any other way than that they reflected the newspaper 's opinion that the circumstances involved reckless surgical activity which ought to be brought to the attention of the public in these circumstances contrary to the findings of the high court i have reached the conclusion that the articles contain an accusation against dr r. that he performed his surgical activities in a reckless way an accusation which i must hold to be incorrect the next question is whether the resulting defamation should for special reasons not be considered to be unlawful among other things the newspaper has referred to its particular duty to attend to the interests of consumers and to the fact that the accusation against dr r. as a whole concerning improper treatment was nevertheless to a great extent correct however dr r. has criticised the newspaper 's handling of the case and has furthermore referred to article of the penal code when a newspaper makes such strong criticism as in this case i consider that dr r. ought to have had the possibilities of a proper defence no time element prevented this when approached on april dr r. could not make any statements about the concrete cases without being released by the patients themselves from his duty to maintain professional secrecy and he did not have a duty to contact the patients himself for that purpose i also find that the third applicant and the newspaper must be criticised for a lack of balance in the articles and for using unnecessarily strong and to some extent misleading expressions that the third applicant was quoting the interviewees is no excuse for completely disregarding dr r. 's right to the protection of privacy that the women had a subjective and strong emotional point of view to what they had experienced is understandable but it is another matter to publish their statements to a large group of readers who would expect that these at least in their essentials covered the objective truth even though there is reason to give a wide scope to freedom of expression in order to enable newspapers to fulfil their function in society i can not but reach the conclusion that the line has been overstepped i see no reason to go into the issue of article the submission that the main content of the accusation has been proven is based on the high court 's assessment of the evidence as far as lack of care and follow-up are concerned the high court 's assessment of the evidence on this point can be seen from remarks spread over several pages of its judgment especially at pp to on p. it stated furthermore at p. it held in these circumstances i must conclude that the essential elements of the accusations to be found in the articles concerning dr r. have not been proven since the alleged deficiencies as regards the surgical activities as set out in the articles clearly overshadow the deficiencies concerning care and follow-up treatment furthermore the accusations are unlawful in my opinion there can be no doubt that the articles have caused considerable financial losses in addition to non-pecuniary damage for dr r. it would have been strange if his clinic had survived the very negative comments in the articles of the newspaper from a commercial point of view cosmetic surgery is very sensitive to anything which might shatter the potential patients faith in the operating doctor the defendants must have been aware of this the calculation of dr r. 's loss involves many elements of uncertainty in no circumstances could he automatically rely on continuing a thriving and profitable business as a private cosmetic surgeon for the rest of his life until reaching the age of retirement even a neutral objective and from any point of view appropriate criticism would have been very damaging to him dr r. shall be granted compensation under section of the damage compensation act skadeserstatningsloven law no of june from the first applicant in respect of damage loss of future income and suffering as regards the two last points the court has a wide discretion according to the applicable legislation but also as regards the first point dr r. 's own conduct may be taken into consideration i have reached the conclusion that the compensation for the damage done i.e loss of income plus interest from until this judgment ought to be fixed at nok as regards the other requests for damages submitted by dr r. i consider that this should be fixed on an equitable basis at nok compensation in respect of loss of future income is fixed at nok further the non-pecuniary damage to be paid by the first applicant is fixed at nok when fixing reparation regard has been had to the exceptional pressure which dr r. has endured over a long period of time due to the series of articles the non-pecuniary damage to be paid by the second and third applicants is fixed at nok each. finally the supreme court ordered that the first applicant pay dr r. nok and that the second and third applicants each pay him nok for his costs in the domestic proceedings plus certain interest with respect to dr r. 's costs in the city court in accordance with the latter the first applicant paid an additional nok and the second and third applicants each paid nok in interest under norwegian defamation law there are three kinds of responses to unlawful defamation namely the imposition of a penalty under the provisions of the penal code an order under article of that code declaring the defamatory allegation null and void mortifikasjon and an order under the damage compensation act skadeserstatningsloven law no of june to pay compensation to the aggrieved party only the latter was at issue in the present case section of the aforementioned act reads a person who has injured the honour or infringed the privacy of another person shall if he has displayed negligence or if the conditions for imposing a penalty are fulfilled pay compensation for the damage sustained and such compensation for loss of future earnings as the court deems reasonable having regard to the degree of negligence and other circumstances he may also be ordered to pay such compensation for non-pecuniary damage as the court deems reasonable if the infringement has occurred in the form of printed matter and the person who has acted in the service of the owner or the publisher thereof is responsible under the first subsection the owner and publisher are also liable to pay compensation the same applies to any redress imposed under the first subsection unless the court finds that there are special grounds for dispensation conditions for holding a defendant liable for defamation are further set out in chapter of the penal code articles and of which provide article any person who by word or deed unlawfully defames another person or who is accessory thereto shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months article any person who by word or deed behaves in a manner that is likely to harm another person 's good name and reputation or to expose him to hatred contempt or loss of the confidence necessary for his position or business or who is accessory thereto shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year if the defamation is committed in print or in broadcasting or otherwise under especially aggravating circumstances imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years may be imposed. a limitation to the applicability of article follows from the requirement that the expression must be unlawful rettstridig while this is expressly stated in article article has been interpreted by the supreme court to include such a requirement in a civil case concerning pre-trial reporting by a newspaper the supreme court found for the newspaper relying on the reservation of lawfulness rettsstridsreservasjonen even though the impugned expressions had been deemed defamatory it held that in determining the scope of this limitation particular weight should be attached to whether the case was of public interest having regard to the nature of the issues and to the kind of parties involved regard should be had to the context in which and the background against which the statements had been made moreover it was of great importance whether the news item had presented the case in a sober and balanced manner and had been aimed at highlighting the subject matter and the object of the case norsk retstidende p. further limitations on the application of article are contained in article the relevant part of which reads punishment may not be imposed under articles and if evidence proving the truth of the accusations is adduced at the hearing on

the case was referred to the court by the european commission of human rights the commission on july within the three-month period laid down by article para and article art art of the convention it originated in an application no against the lodged with the commission under article art by a greek national mr constantinos hadjianastassiou on december the commission s request referred to articles and art art and to the declaration whereby recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the court article art the object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent state of its obligations under articles and art art of the convention in response to the enquiry made in accordance with rule para d of the rules of court the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him rule the chamber to be constituted included ex officio mr n. valticos the elected judge of greek nationality article of the convention art and mr r. ryssdal the president of the court rule para b on august in the presence of the registrar the president drew by lot the names of the other seven members namely mr j. cremona mr thór vilhjálmsson mr j de meyer mrs e. palm mr i. foighel mr r. pekkanen and sir john freeland article in fine of the convention and rule para art subsequently mr s. k. martens substitute judge replaced mr cremona who had left the court on the expiry of his term of office and whose successor had taken up his duties before the hearing rules para and para mr ryssdal assumed the office of president of the chamber rule para and through the registrar consulted the agent of the greek government the government the delegate of the commission and the applicant s lawyer on the organisation of the procedure rules para and pursuant to the order made in consequence the registrar received the applicant s memorial on february and the government s memorial on february on june the secretary to the commission informed the registrar that the delegate would submit oral observations on march the commission had produced various documents as the registrar at the government s request had asked it to do in accordance with the president s decision the hearing took place in public in the on june the court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant the court heard addresses by the above-mentioned representatives and by mr hadjianastassiou in person as well as their answers to its questions mr hadjianastassiou a greek national is an aeronautical engineer at the material time he was a captain in the air force as the officer in charge of a project for the design and production of a guided missile he submitted in a report to the air force technological research centre k.e.t.a on the missile on which he had been working in january he communicated to a private company elfon ltd another technical study on guided missiles which he had prepared himself on july a chamber of the permanent air force court of athens diarkes stratodikeio athinon charged the applicant and another person with disclosing military secrets article of the military criminal code see paragraph below on october the court found mr hadjianastassiou guilty of having transmitted to elfon a series of ten items of information together with all the technical and theoretical data appearing in the k.e.t.a report it sentenced him to two years and six months imprisonment the applicant and the prosecutor at the epitropos tou anatheoritikou dikastiriou appealed from that judgment following a hearing held on february and march the appointed two experts professors at the who with two other experts designated by the applicant compared the two studies in their report of september the two professors concluded as follows in our opinion the two studies for the k.e.t.a and elfon follow different methods the two missiles are different and the second is not a copy of the first nevertheless some transfer of technical knowledge inevitably occurred it is not possible to determine the extent of such transfer beyond what is mentioned above under b c and d because the elfon study and even more so the k.e.t.a report were shoddily drafted and were full of imprecisions and omissions it should be stressed that in both studies the aerodynamic data are erroneous they noted that mr hadjianastassiou had some technical knowledge acquired during his studies in the however his participation in the k.e.t.a project had enriched his experience the components of the missile and some of the theoretical data contained in the two studies could be found in various manuals included in the file and regarded as available literature these manuals were not classified as secret but it was not established that they were accessible to private individuals at a new hearing held on and november the took evidence from nineteen witnesses on whether the two studies contained common data whether the information which had formed the basis of the studies was freely available in scientific literature and whether the k.e.t.a study had been classified as a military secret after the hearing the deliberated in private and considered the following questions formulated by its president is constantinos hadjianastassiou guilty of having between october and march unlawfully and intentionally communicated and disclosed to third parties military plans and information classified as secret and which had to remain secret in the military interests of the in particular is he guilty of having in october after having contacted the company elfon ltd with a view to preparing and drawing up for the latter s benefit a study on guided missiles for a financial consideration to be agreed with the said company when the work was in progress unlawfully and intentionally a communicated to the above-mentioned company general information concerning the guided missile which was being designed at the k.e.t.a and its technical characteristics although as project officer for the k.e.t.a missile he knew that such information was secret and that the military interests of the greek state required that it be kept secret b transmitted to the same company several elements deriving from the study relating to the project and on the same subject-matter of the k.e.t.a and from the whole production programme of the greek guided missile laser kit which existed at the centre and which concerned principally the dimensional diagram of the missile its external geometry its perimetric plan its aerodynamic elements its nd-yag laser type its dynamic model its dome its schematic diagram its seeker s fairing its basic electronics data as well as any other theoretical or technical elements contained in the elfon ltd study which was elaborated entirely on the basis of the information transmitted and disclosed by him to the company and derived from the corresponding k.e.t.a project and study although he knew in his capacity as project officer that the information was secret and that the military interests of the required that it be kept secret has it been established that when he disclosed these military secrets the accused believed erroneously that he was entitled to proceed in such a way or on the other hand that he reasonably believed that having drawn up the k.e.t.a study and used his own knowledge he was entitled to elaborate a new study and submit it through the intermediary of the company elfon ltd to the weapons industry department was this belief justifiable has it been established that the military secrets thus disclosed namely the general information which the accused communicated to the elfon company concerning the guided missile and its technical characteristics were of minor importance should certain factors be taken into account in mitigation namely that prior to committing the above- mentioned act the accused had led an honest and well-ordered private family and professional life according to the record of the deliberations the replied in the affirmative to questions a four votes to one and unanimously and in the negative to questions b four votes to one and three votes to two giving judgment in mr hadjianastassiou s presence on november it sentenced him for disclosure of military secrets of minor importance article para of the military criminal code see paragraph below to a suspended term of five months imprisonment from which it deducted the four months and fourteen days which he had spent in detention on remand the president of the read out the judgment which did not refer to the questions put to the members of the court in order to obtain the text of these questions and the replies given the applicant asked on november to see the record of the hearing the registrar allegedly told him that he would have to wait for the finalised version of the judgment on november within the five days prescribed in article para of the military criminal code see paragraph below mr hadjianastassiou appealed to the court of cassation in his appeal which was a page long he alleged the erroneous application and interpretation of the provisions under which he had been convicted namely article para of the military criminal code he received a copy of the appeal judgment on december it was very short and did not state the grounds on which it was based merely referring to the fixing of sentence on december the applicant again demanded that the record be communicated to him he received it on january this document which was detailed and reproduced in full the six questions and the replies obtained ended as follows the court by four votes to one finds the accused hadjianastassiou guilty of disclosing military secrets which offence was committed in attica between october and march by three votes to two the court dismisses the defence request that article para of the criminal code not guilty in the event of mistake be applied the court unanimously accepts that the military secrets communicated are of minor importance the court unanimously accepts the factors pleaded in mitigation article para a of the criminal code having regard to the following articles article para taken in conjunction with paragraph and with article e articles of the military criminal code having regard to the gravity of the acts carried out to the accused s personality to the damage caused by the offence to the specific nature of the offence to the specific circumstances under which the offence was committed to the degree of criminal intent on the part of the accused to his character to his personal and social situation and to his conduct before and after the commission of the offence the court sentences the accused to five months imprisonment and orders him to pay the costs it deducts from the above-mentioned term the period of four months and fourteen days spent in detention on remand and sets at sixteen days the term still to be served in view of the fact that the accused has no previous convictions and has never been sentenced to prison and having regard to the circumstances under which the offence was committed the court considers it appropriate to suspend the remainder of the sentence for these reasons having regard to articles and of the criminal code the court orders that the outstanding term of imprisonment be suspended for a period of three years the hearing in the court of cassation areios pagos took place on april on april mr hadjianastassiou filed a memorial in support of his oral pleadings in his submission the wording of his appeal was sufficient to rule out any danger of its being dismissed for lack of precision he complained of the shortness of the time-limit for appealing against the decisions of the military courts and the fact that it was impossible for the persons concerned to gain access in good time to the contents of the contested judgments he also challenged the ground on which his conviction rested the communication of general information on the k.e.t.a missile the charge which the courts-martial appeal court found to be proved did not justify the application of article of the military criminal code as that provision concerned the disclosure of secret information of military importance a charge of which the courts-martial appeal court had acquitted him by its reply to question b see paragraph above in his view at the most his case might fall under article see paragraph below on june the court of cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on the following grounds by the appeal before the court in which it is sought to have judgment no of the athens courts-martial appeal court set aside the applicant challenges the aforesaid judgment on the ground of erroneous application and interpretation of the provisions under which he was convicted namely article para of the military criminal code however this sole ground of appeal as formulated above is vague inasmuch as it does not identify any concrete and specific error in the contested judgment which could constitute the basis of the complaint alleging the erroneous application and interpretation of the above-mentioned provision the appeal must therefore be declared inadmissible by virtue of articles para and para of the code of criminal procedure the military criminal code provides as follows article communication of military information any serviceman or any person employed by the armed forces who without the consent of the military authorities communicates or makes public by any means whatsoever information or assessments concerning the army shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six

provisions of the present paragraph and the date of their entry into force shall be specified by statute according to the consistent case-law of the court of cassation the failure to give reasons in the decisions of the military courts does not render them void the application to these courts of article para of the constitution requires under the terms of article para the adoption of special laws and this has not yet happened judgments nos nomiko vima p. and it is sufficient that such a decision answers the questions put by the president the questions must indicate accurately all the offences

in question as found by the military courts of first or second instance judgments nos and the following texts are relevant here article formulation of questions principal question the president shall

the case originated in an application no against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by redaktsiya gazety orlovskaya iskra hereinafter orlovskaya iskra or the applicant organisation on july the applicant organisation was represented by mr d. krayukhin the russian government the government were represented by mr g. matyushkin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights the applicant organisation complained under article of the convention about the classification of the articles it published as election campaigning material and about the fine imposed in the administrative offence case on april the application was communicated to the government the applicant is a non-governmental organisation that publishes orlovskaya iskra a newspaper in the orel region as of march the orel branch of the communist party of the russian federation and the orel branch of the people s patriotic union of russia a nationwide movement were listed as the applicant organisation s founders this information was specified on the front page of the newspaper pursuant to the articles of incorporation the founders were in charge of setting up an editorial board and determining the editorial policy in the case of disagreement on the editorial policy the matter was to be resolved by a meeting of the founders representatives during the election campaign for the state duma the lower chamber of parliament on december the applicant organisation expressed to the electoral committee of the orel region see paragraph below its intention to accept proposals for publication for a fee and as required by law published the fees applicable to the publications on behalf of political parties roubles rub per page the applicant organisation specified that the above fee was not applicable to the newspaper s founder the applicant organisation signed a contract with the communist party for this purpose for publications on and november the contract mentioned a fee of rub per page the total amount of the contract was rub for ten pages some of the publications in the applicant organisation s newspaper on these dates did mention the party s sponsorship others did not see paragraph below apart from the publications mentioned above on and november the applicant organisation s newspaper also published in the same weekly issues two articles written by its staff correspondent ms o both articles were critical of mr stroyev the then governor of the orel region and the former chairman of the federation council the upper chamber of the russian parliament governor stroyev was a candidate at those elections he was no on the regional list of united russia единая россия a political party aligned with president putin and dominant in the state duma the communist party was one of the main opposition parties at those elections the first article was entitled ‘ hatred stroyev style it can be summarised as follows it described governor stroyev as a person consumed by hatred towards people who oppose him the journalist referred to the decision of the governor to wind up a publicly owned newspaper gorod orel according to journalist o. that decision was a direct consequence of a conflict between mr stroyev and the newspaper s former editor-in-chief who kept criticising stroyev s policies the speaker of the municipal council who was politically weak owing to a corruption scandal involving municipal land was unable to oppose the decision of the governor to close the newspaper most of the regional journalists under stroyev became servile those few who like the editor-in-chief of gorod orel remained independent and refused to flatter mr stroyev were subjected to pressure and fell victim to mr stroyev s hatred the article then turned to the story of two deputies of the regional legislature they were elected as members of the communist party and were originally in opposition to mr stroyev but later they both became members of united russia one of them was a businessman the author suspected that the first deputy had changed political sides because of very serious pressure exerted by the stroyev administration on local businessmen the second deputy was a history professor the article suggested that his decision to leave the communist party was also forced the journalist ironically supposed that in fact mr stroyev did not want united russia to win the elections since he was doing everything to make the electorate angry with the ruling party in the town population voted in large numbers for the communist party which was in fact a vote of disapproval of mr stroyev s policies however the journalist supposed that mr stroyev s personal interests always prevailed over those of the united russia party the town mayor tried to protect himself by joining united russia but this was a weak defence against mr stroyev s hatred the only people mr stroyev loved and defended were his own relatives and protégés the article cited the example of mr stroyev s nephew a businessman suspected of abuse of public funds and fraud his case was still pending the article suggested that regional law-enforcement agencies being discouraged from pursuing the investigation actively the article then turned to the dismissal of the head of the regional public audit chamber who reported on abuses of funds allocated for road maintenance the newly appointed head of the audit chamber who was mr stroyev s man came to the opposite conclusion namely that the manipulation of the road funds had been perfectly in order nevertheless the money had been spent as a result the federal authorities had had to allocate additional funds for road maintenance in the orel region mr stroyev tried to get credit for that funding but it was not united russia s money that had been used as they claimed but taxpayers money in the opinion of the author by trying to present the whole situation as his personal achievement mr stroyev was making a fool of president putin and of the population of the orel region the article had a long post-scriptum it cited the european court s findings in the case of chemodurov v. russia no judgment of july that case concerned a defamation claim lodged by a governor of another russian region against a journalist of a local newspaper the case ended with a finding of a violation of article of the convention by the court the author alluded to similarities between her criticism of mr stroyev s policies and the situation in the chemodurov case the second article was entitled ‘ stroyev sues people people sue stroyev it also concerned several topics it opened with the statement that the electorate of orel region did not trust the authorities and at the and elections preferred to support the communist party next it touched upon the story of ms ch. a former forest inspector who was dismissed from her job as a result of a reorganisation of the forestry authority forty-two other workers of the forest authority also lost their jobs the article alleged that the reform of the forest authorities was initiated by governor stroyev in breach of federal legislation it suggested that the reform was driven by the need to facilitate industrial tree-cutting ms ch sued the regional authorities and at the relevant time the proceedings were pending however in the opinion of the journalist there was little hope for impartiality on the part of the regional courts the article then turned to the case of ms g. who had made statements critical of the governor during a public rally and had been prosecuted for slander the article then analysed recent public statements of the governor who had criticised the policy lines of former president yeltsin whereas he himself during that period had been chairman of the federation council and therefore the second most important statesman in the country according to the journalist the proceedings in the case of mr g. were adjourned probably because governor stroyev wanted to avoid a scandal before the date of elections the article closed with the suggestion that president putin should not have associated himself such controversial figures as governor stroyev on november the working group on informational disputes of the regional electoral committee examined both articles the working group concluded that the articles contained elements of electoral campaigning агитация the working group concluded as follows the publications contained negative purposeful systematically published information about a member of the high political council of the united russia political party mr e. stroyev the above-mentioned publications have created a negative attitude on the part of the voters towards united russia although the text of the articles does not call for people to vote for or against united russia all the electorate understand that this is in fact counter-campaigning against mr stroyev the publications did not correspond to the current information policy of the organisations editing mass media which the policy was aimed at informing the voters about the development of the electoral campaign and about the political parties participating in it those articles in the opinion of the electoral committee fell outside the information space created by the political parties during the ongoing electoral campaign the publication of those articles was not paid for from the official campaign fund of any party participating in the campaign contrary to section of the electoral rights act of consequently in the opinion of the electoral committee publication of those articles amounted to a breach of electoral law punishable by a fine in accordance with article of the federal code of administrative offences cao the official of the electoral committee compiled an administrative offence record against the applicant organisation referring to the legislative provisions defining campaigning see paragraph below the applicant organisation has committed an administrative offence publications on and november containing elements of election campaigning as defined in sections and of the state duma deputies elections act liability for this offence is prescribed under article of the cao. the case was then submitted to a justice of the peace on november the justice of the peace examined the case at the hearing the editor-in-chief of the newspaper explained that both articles were informational in essence and were not a part of the election campaign they reflected the author s opinion of governor stroyev consequently there was no need for those articles to be paid for from any candidate s campaign fund the judge held that according to the state duma deputies elections act of taken in conjunction with the electoral rights act election campaigning meant publications where information about one of the candidates prevailed and was combined with negative comment about him or her having studied the impugned articles the judge agreed with the electoral committee that they primarily concerned candidate stroyev and secondly were negative the judge concluded that those articles were in substance election campaigning such material should either have been paid for from the campaign fund of one of the candidates or have been published free of charge in any event the newspaper had been required to indicate who had sponsored the publication no such mention had been made in the articles consequently the publication of both articles amounted to a breach of the electoral law the applicant organisation was therefore found guilty of the administrative offence described in article of the code of administrative offences of hereinafter the cao the justice of the peace ordered the applicant organisation to pay a fine of roubles rub equivalent to euros eur at the time the applicant organisation appealed to the zheleznodorozhny district court of orel on december it heard the applicant organisation s representatives and rejected the appeal the relevant extract from the judgment reads as follows having regard to the fact that the publication of the above articles took place during an election campaign period the judge considers that the above-mentioned articles contained elements of election campaigning and therefore could be described as campaign literature this conclusion is supported by the words of the representatives of the newspaper who acknowledged that the articles contained criticism of governor stroyev the appeal decision entered into legal force on the same date on unspecified dates the applicant organisation received a copy of this decision and lodged a supervisory-review application with the president of the orel regional court the scope of that application remains unclear without holding a hearing on january the acting president of the court issued a decision dismissing the application the reasoning of the decision of the acting president was identical to that of the lower courts on an unspecified date the applicant organisation received a copy of the acting president s decision the applicant organisation then lodged a supervisory-review application with the president of the supreme court of russia the scope of this application remains unclear on june the vice-president dismissed it on an unspecified date the applicant organisation received a copy of this decision on an unspecified date the applicant organisation introduced an individual application before the constitutional court of russia arguing that the impugned provisions of the electoral rights act and the state duma deputies election act ran counter to freedom of the press the acts de facto regarded any critical material published during a pre-election period as campaigning and imposed additional requirements on such publications by a letter of october the registry of the constitutional court informed the applicant organisation that its application was not allowed because in substance it was merely challenging the factual and legal findings made by the courts in the administrative offence case on an unspecified date the applicant organisation resubmitted its application to the constitutional court on december a panel of judges of the constitutional court issued a decision определение refusing examination of the application it held as follows in its ruling of october the constitutional court made the following statement of principle concerning a distinction between information for voters and pre-election campaigning to protect the right to free elections freedom of expression on the part of the mass media may be restricted provided that the balance of constitutional values has been respected the electoral rights act distinguishes between information for voters appearing in the mass media and pre-election campaigning by them both information and campaigning can influence voters to make certain choices thus the obvious and only criterion to distinguish between them would be the existence of a particular aim namely to incline voters to support or oppose a certain candidate without such an aim in mind there would be no dividing line between information and campaigning to the effect that all information would amount to campaigning this would go against the constitutional guarantees of freedom of information and freedom of expression it is incumbent on the courts and other authorities to establish that there is a campaigning aim in each case thus in view of the above statement of principle the impugned legislative provisions can not be considered to have violated the applicant organisation s rights or freedoms establishment of the specific circumstances whether or not the information provided by the applicant organisation concerned the electoral campaign rather than the reporting on the candidate s professional activity as a governor are beyond of the constitutional court s competence under the cao depending on the subject matter decisions concerning administrative offences could be issued by a non-judicial authority or a court chapter of the cao at the relevant time chapter of the cao contained provisions concerning review of such decisions review could be sought by the person or legal entity accused of the administrative offence the victim of the offence or their representatives article if the decision on the administrative offence concerned a legal entity or a person engaged in entrepreneurial activities it was reviewed by a commercial court according to the rules of commercial procedure article an ordinary appeal against a decision on an administrative offence could be lodged within ten days or fifteen days for some offences following receipt of the copy of the decision article the appeal should be examined within ten days or within shorter periods for some offences following receipt of the case file to the reviewing court or authority article the reviewing authority or court was not bound by the scope of arguments and reviews in the case in its entirety article article gave a prosecutor a right to seek review of a decision on an administrative offence within the procedure and time-limits set in articles of the cao until december article of the cao provided for supervisory review of final court decisions taken in respect of administrative offences a regional prosecutor or his deputy the prosecutor general of the russian federation or his deputy had a right to apply for such a review pursuant to the ruling no of march by the plenary supreme court of russia those prosecuted in administrative offences cases also had a right to lodge a supervisory-review application if a supervisory-review judge had doubts about the lawfulness of the impugned court decisions he or she could request the case file and then examine the case in its entirety going beyond the grounds for review raised by the author of the supervisory-review application of the ruling of march supervisory review was to be carried out by the president of the regional court or their deputies and by the president of the supreme court of russia or her deputies reviewing this provision the constitutional court of russia stated that the reviewing court was to inform the person concerned by the administrative offence proceedings about the application for review lodged by the victim decision no of april concerning the constitutional interpretation of article of the cao this decision was officially published in july the constitutional court also stated that until legislative amendment of the cao concerning the scope of review grounds for review the reviewing courts powers time-limits for seeking review and the procedure for such a review the reviewing courts were to be guided by the relevant provisions of chapter of the code of commercial procedure article of the cao was deleted in december article provided that first-instance and appeal judgments which had become final could be challenged by way of review before regional courts and the supreme court of russia apparently the decision no of april was not applied by some regional courts see decision no of august by the chelyabinsk regional court and a contrario decision no of november by the rostov regional court some regional courts stated that this decision was no longer applicable following the deletion of article of the cao during the legislative reform in december see decision no of december by the chelyabinsk regional court under article of the russian constitution everyone has a right to freedom of expression and a right to freely seek receive transfer produce or disseminate information by any lawful means the freedom of mass information свобода массовой информации is also protected russian citizens have a right to elect and to be elected to public office and to

the exercise of electoral rights by the citizens section of the state duma deputies election act regional and local mass media outlets are required to inform a regional electoral committee about their intention to publish campaigning material submitted by political parties and about the related fees and other relevant conditions section article of the federal code of administrative offences was entitled violation of the procedure for participation of the mass media in the information support of the elections or referenda this article punished violations of the procedure for publishing materials including campaigning material that were related to an electoral campaign and elections it concerned chief editors of the mass media or its editorial board legal entities dealing with broadcasting as well as other organisations that disseminate material for mass consumption in the constitutional court of russia examined several individual applications and an application from a group of members of the state duma on october the constitutional court issued ruling no concerning sections and and of the electoral rights act see paragraph above the ruling was published in october and november in several official bulletins and journals the constitutional court found as follows in order to secure free elections the federal legislator is empowered to set in place procedures and conditions for information support информационное обеспечение for the elections free elections also require protection of the right to information and the freedom to express opinions therefore the legislator must protect citizens rights to receive and disseminate information about elections while striking a balance between two constitutional values namely the right to free elections and freedom of information and expression avoiding inequality and disproportionate restrictions mass media outlets carry out a social function consisting in information support for elections and should accompany the free expression of the citizens choice and transparent elections the exercise of the freedom of mass information is accompanied by particular duties and a particular responsibility on the part of mass media outlets thus while acting on the basis of editorial independence and the rules of self-regulation the representatives of the mass media outlets must take ethical and balanced stances and cover election campaigns in a fair balanced and impartial manner distinguishing between two elements of information support for elections namely information and campaigning the electoral rights act is intended to exclude representatives of mass media outlets from campaigning activities this distinction is aimed at securing open elections and at ensuring the process of formation формирование of the free expression of the citizens choice unlike information campaigning is not subject to the requirement of objectivity limitation on the freedom to express opinion aims at protecting the right to free elections which is one of the foundations of the constitutional regime including the process of formation of the citizens free expression of their choice restrictions or limitations on the freedom of mass information must be necessary and proportionate to the constitutionally recognised aims where constitutional rules allow such restrictions the regulation should not impinge upon the very essence of the right or freedom being restricted and should not empty it of its real content the state should not use excessive measures the regulatory legislation should be clear and precise without room for extensive interpretation of the allowable restrictions and arbitrary application all the above corresponds to the case-law of the european court of human rights in relation to the scope of the freedom of expression and right to information in the context of elections bowman v. the united kingdom february reports of judgments and decisions both campaigning and information may induce the electorate to vote in favour of one choice or another the only criterion for distinguishing between them is the presence of a special goal inherent in campaigning that is to induce voters to vote in one specific direction and to provide support whether that is for or against a candidate if this were not so the line between information and campaigning would be blurred to the extent that all information disseminated in this period would be classified as campaigning in view of the prohibition on mass media outlets campaigning this would entail unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information while also breaching the principles of free and open elections as such the expression of a positive or negative opinion about a candidate does not amount to campaigning and thus can not entail administrative offence liability on the part of the mass media outlet a special purpose consisting in the support or opposition to a specific candidate is necessary expression of preference is a manner of expressing an opinion thus expression of a preference by a representative of a mass media outlet can not be classified as an offence in the absence of a campaigning purpose the relevant provisions of the act did not permit an extensive interpretation of the notion of pre-election campaigning in so far as the ban concerns the professional activities of mass media the relevant provisions mean that unlawful campaigning includes only the premeditated acts listed in section which are directly aimed at such campaigning and differ from providing information to the voters the constitutional court also ruled that section should not be interpreted as providing a basis for prohibiting the mass media from expressing their opinions or from comment outside specific news bulletins the constitutional court stated that other actions beyond those listed in section aimed at inducing voters to vote for candidates lists of candidates or against them against all candidates or against all lists should not be treated as pre-election campaigning the constitutional court concluded that this constitutional interpretation of the relevant provisions of the electoral rights act excludes any other interpretation in judicial practice and also any other interpretation of similar provisions of other legislation the constitutional court also stated that this constitutional interpretation of the legal provisions was mandatory for everyone and excluded any other interpretation by the courts in respect of the same provisions or similar provisions of other legal acts furthermore the constitutional court concluded in respect of the individual applicants that their cases were to be re-examined unless there were obstacles to doing so judge gadzhiyev expressed a separate opinion noting that in bowman v. the united kingdom cited above the european court assessed the freedom of expression in the light of the right to free elections which means that neither has priority over the other this is the only kind of approach which makes it possible to seek a balance between these equally valued fundamental rights the exercise of one right creates inherent boundaries for the other right having regard to article of the russian constitution which defines russia s international treaties as an integral part of its legal system the choice between the relevant legitimate aims may be used to set limits on a protected right in line with the european convention given the aims listed in article of the european convention only some of the aims listed in article of the russian constitution may be referred to when limits are set on the freedom to express opinions judge kononov also expressed a separate opinion as follows while upholding the majority s restrictive interpretation and application of the campaigning regulations the judge noted that some provisions of the electoral rights act could not but be assessed as absurd and utterly lacking reasonable grounds all possible and justified restrictions on the freedom of the mass media are listed in section of the mass media act there is no reason to treat an electoral campaign as an emergency situation that would justify wider limitations on rights and freedoms quite to the contrary the voters need to receive and disseminate information to express opinions and to know about views held in society are greater during an election campaign print broadcast and other media serve as a necessary means of exercising the right to free choice without losing their autonomous and independent role in society freedom to express opinions should be given a wider possible interpretation in the constitutional court of slovakia declared a similar statute unconstitutional dismissing the argument justifying the restriction in the interest of free competition among political actors that court held that democracy not being a form of government instituted exclusively for the sake of political parties denial of fundamental rights and freedoms for the benefit of parties equals denial of democracy judge kononov concluded that there were no compelling reasons for opposing freedom of expression and freedom of choice and thus no justification for putting in place special limitations on the mass media during an election period before the constitutional court the russian authorities referred to the need to counter black pr or negative paid-for publications rather than to the need to ensure free choice for voters one of the election commission officials admitted that if there had been an efficient mechanism to supervise payment for publications there would have been no need to create restrictions on the wording of campaigning by the mass media in judge kononov s view the issue of paid-for publications should have been resolved by other more appropriate means rather than by restricting fundamental freedoms in his separate opinion judge yaroslavtsev considered that the impugned provisions of the electoral rights act violated freedom of expression and the principle of free elections free elections require free expression of the citizens choice which is achievable if there is a choice available and also unhindered expression of preferences by way of free expression of opinions for or against a candidate the free expression of choice requires access to information which should be truthful and objective referring to the european court s judgment in bowman cited above the majority overlooked that a conflict between freedom of expression and the right to free elections arises only in certain circumstances so that usually restrictions on freedom of expression would not be acceptable in the absence of any pressing social need during a pre-election period varied opinions and information including information containing preference for a candidate should be allowed to circulate freely the requirements of objectivity and truthfulness apply so that the relevant information will guide voters irrespective of the preference expressed within the text of the information in the constitutional court examined an application concerning the provisions contained after in section of the electoral rights act it issued an inadmissibility decision no dated april the court stated as follows as stated in the ruling of october it was necessary to distinguish between campaigning and information because without such a distinction there would be adverse consequences for the mass media in that the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and information would be unlawfully restricted it would also violate the principle of free and open elections the primary criterion for distinguishing between campaigning and information had to be the presence of a particular campaigning aim namely to incline voters in one direction to secure either support for or opposition to a specific candidate or electoral bloc the constitutional court also found in its ruling on the provisions of the electoral rights act concerning the procedure for giving information that news bulletins and printed publications must confine their information about pre-election events to one separate information note without comment and without giving preference to any one or electoral bloc the constitutional court held in the ruling that the above provisions should not be interpreted as banning the mass media from expressing opinions or from commenting outside the scope of the information note thus assessing the impugned legislative provision within the scope of the current regulatory framework and the above-mentioned statements of principle by the constitutional court and taking into account the special role of the mass media in the electoral process the impugned provision could not be perceived as giving preference to the mass media over other participants in the electoral process thus the impugned provision did not violate the applicant organisation s rights in the relevant aspect by ruling no of june the constitutional court examined various provisions of the electoral rights act including its sections and in so far as it allegedly prevented citizens who were not themselves candidates or representatives of candidates or electoral groups from engaging in election campaigning for or against a candidate or a list of candidates and thereby incurring expenses outwith election funds the constitutional court held as follows having regard to the need for free expression for citizens during elections held at reasonable periods and the need for such elections to be of a competitive and transparent nature the federal legislature had to put in place a set of criteria for information flow including rules for election campaigning and its funding to reconcile the exercise of electoral rights freedom of expression and freedom of mass information the federal legislature had discretion to choose appropriate methods and means that take account of the historical conditions that prevail at a particular stage of the country s development to reconcile any conflict between these competing rights and freedoms the legislature was to maintain the balance of constitutional values and not put in place disproportionate restrictions that would not be necessary in a democratic society and that would impinge upon the very essence of the protected rights the exclusion of russian citizens from election campaigning and the absence of legislative safeguards would mean in substance refusing them a realistic opportunity to influence the electoral process confining them to the action of casting a vote the absence of free political discussion and opportunities for a free exchange of opinions including both candidates and citizens during the elections would make it impossible to consider such elections as free the legislature had to ensure adequate exercise of the citizens right to receive and impart information about elections under the electoral rights act information flow was ensured by the provision of information about candidates dates and the procedural for electoral acts as well as by election campaigning aimed at inducing voters to vote for or against a candidate candidates were allowed to put in place campaign funds and to incur expenses from such funds for campaigning purposes and to have broadcast time and access to the print media both paid and free of charge other citizens were allowed to engage in election campaigning without incurring expenses by way of public gatherings or otherwise they could also make contributions to campaign funds within the limits prescribed by law at that stage of russia s development the need to ensure transparent financing of elections required reinforced safeguards therefore also taking into account the current realistic possibility of control over the financing of elections the applicable regulatory framework including sections and of the electoral rights act pursued a legitimate aim and did not upset the balance of constitutional values it also complied with the criterion of being necessary in a democratic society and was not disproportionate vis-à-vis the constitutionally protected aims judge kononov issued a separate opinion noting that a political discussion could not be a dispute about objective facts opinions and comments by their nature contain value judgments and the potential to induce a choice or a preference moreover it is frequently difficult to determine the exact intention behind an utterance thus exclusion of value judgments from the notion of information their arbitrary classification as campaigning and the removal from ordinary citizens of the opportunity to express their attitude toward a candidate and his or her policy choices significantly impinged upon the constitutional rights set out in article of the constitution recommendation no r of the committee of ministers to member states on measures concerning media coverage of election campaigns appendix to recommendation no r scope of the recommendation the principles of fairness balance and impartiality in the coverage of election campaigns by the media should apply to all types of political elections taking place in member states that is presidential legislative regional and where practicable local elections and political referenda these principles should also apply where relevant to media reporting on elections taking place abroad especially when these media address citizens of the country where the election is taking place measures concerning the print media freedom of the press regulatory frameworks on media coverage of elections should not interfere with the editorial independence of newspapers or magazines nor with their right to express any political preference measures concerning the broadcast media general framework during electoral campaigns regulatory frameworks should encourage and facilitate the pluralistic expression of opinions via the broadcast media with due respect for the editorial independence of broadcasters regulatory frameworks should also provide for the obligation to cover electoral campaigns in a fair balanced and impartial manner in the overall programme services of broadcasters such an obligation should apply to both public service broadcasters as well as private broadcasters in their relevant transmission areas in member states where the notion of pre-electoral time is defined under domestic legislation the rules on fair balanced and impartial coverage of electoral campaigns by the broadcast media should also apply to this period paid political advertising in member states where political parties and candidates are permitted to buy advertising space for electoral purposes regulatory frameworks should ensure that the possibility of buying advertising space should be available to all contending parties and on equal conditions and rates of payment the public is aware that the message is a paid political advertisement member states may consider introducing a provision in their regulatory frameworks to limit the amount of political advertising space which a given party or candidate can purchase measures concerning both the print and broadcast media day of reflection member states may consider the merits of including a provision in their regulatory frameworks to prohibit the dissemination of partisan electoral messages on the day preceding voting measures to protect the media at election time non-interference by public authorities public authorities should refrain from interfering in the activities of journalists and other media personnel with a view to influencing the elections recommendation cm/rec of the committee of ministers to member states on measures concerning media coverage of election campaigns the committee of ministers under the terms of article of the statute of the council of europe noting the important role of the media in modern societies especially at the time of elections considering the constant development of information and communication technology and the evolving media landscape which necessitates the revision of recommendation no r of the committee of ministers on measures concerning media coverage of election campaigns aware of the need to take account of the significant differences which still exist between the print and the broadcast media considering the differences between linear and non-linear audiovisual media services in particular as regards their reach impact and the way in which they are consumed stressing that the fundamental principle of editorial independence of the media .assumes a special importance in election periods underlining that the coverage of elections by the broadcast media should be fair balanced and impartial recalling the basic principles contained in resolution no adopted at the ministerial conference on mass media policy prague december and recommendation no r of the committee of ministers on the guarantee of the independence of public service broadcasting noting the emergence of public service media in the information society as elaborated in recommendation rec of the committee of ministers on the remit of public service media in the information society considering that public service media are a publicly accountable source of information which have a particular responsibility in ensuring in their programmes a fair balanced and thorough coverage of elections which may include the carrying of messages of political parties and candidates free of charge and on an equitable basis noting that particular attention should be paid to certain specific features of the coverage of election campaigns such as the dissemination of opinion polls paid political advertising the right of reply days of reflection and provision for preelection time stressing the important role of self-regulatory measures by media professionals themselves for example in the form of codes of conduct which set out guidelines of good practice for responsible accurate and fair coverage of election campaigns recognising the complementary nature of regulatory and self-regulatory measures in this area convinced of the usefulness of appropriate frameworks for media coverage of elections to contribute to free and democratic elections bearing in mind the different legal and practical approaches of member states in this area and the fact that it can be subject to different branches of law acknowledging that any regulatory framework on the media coverage of elections should respect the fundamental principle of freedom of expression protected under article of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as interpreted by the european court of human rights recalling recommendation of the committee of ministers on the right of reply in the new media environment which allows the possibility for easy-to-use instant or rapid correction of contested information recommends that the governments of the member states if they have not already done so examine ways of ensuring respect for the principles stated hereinafter regarding the coverage of election campaigns by the media and where necessary adopt appropriate measures to implement these principles in their domestic law or practice and in accordance with constitutional law principles general provisions non-interference by public authorities public authorities should refrain from interfering in the activities of journalists and other media personnel with a view to influencing the elections protection against attacks intimidation or other types of unlawful pressure on the media public authorities should take appropriate steps for the effective protection of journalists and other media personnel and their premises as this assumes a greater significance during elections at the same time this protection should not obstruct the media in carrying out their work editorial independence regulatory frameworks on media coverage of elections should respect the editorial independence of the media member states should ensure that there is an effective and manifest separation between the exercise of control of media and decision making as regards media content and the exercise of political authority or influence professional and ethical standards of the media all media are encouraged to develop self-regulatory frameworks and incorporate self-regulatory professional and ethical standards regarding their coverage of election campaigns including inter alia respect for the principles of human dignity and non-discrimination these standards should reflect their particular roles and responsibilities in democratic processes transparency of and access to the media if the media accept paid political advertising regulatory or self-regulatory frameworks should ensure that such advertising is readily recognisable as such where media is owned by political parties or politicians member states should ensure that this is made transparent to the public measures concerning broadcast media paid political advertising in member states where political parties and candidates are permitted to buy advertising space for election purposes regulatory frameworks should ensure that all contending parties have the possibility of buying advertising space on and according to equal conditions and rates of payment member states may consider introducing a provision in their regulatory frameworks to limit the amount of political advertising space and time which a given party or candidate can purchase regular presenters of news and current affairs programmes should not take part in paid political advertising. opinion no by the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission on the federal law on the election of the deputies of the state duma of the russian federation adopted by the council for democratic elections at its meeting venice march and by the venice commission at its plenary session venice march as paragraph of the code of good practice in electoral matters states democratic elections are not possible without respect for human rights in particular freedom of expression and of the press an open debate of ideas is vital in a democratic system especially in an election period actually freedom of the press is more vital in campaigning than in any other moment of political life since it permits to express opinions on candidate programs and to criticize public powers voters can not form their will properly without free debate of ideas not only between candidates but also by journalists and citizens in the media as established by the case-law of the european court of human rights restrictions of these freedoms must have a basis in law be in the public interest and comply with the principle of proportionality according to this principle fewer restrictions may be admitted concerning private media than public media however there are a number of limitations on media that can restrict freedom of speech disproportionately for example article imposes neutrality on public or private media and prohibits any comments or information given on election campaigning events article defines as election campaign any action performed by members of the press if their professional actions are repeatedly performed to encourage voters to vote for or against some federal list of candidates it is true that the restrictions cited above are in the public interest since their aim is to guarantee equality however these limitations put the proportionality principle at risk because the damages caused to freedom of expression are heavier than the benefits generated to equality it must be added that similar ends could be reached with less dangerous means for the freedom of the press article prohibits campaigning by a number of categories of people if such restrictions may favour neutrality of the state when applied to public officials they do not appear as justified concerning members of the press article opinion no code of good practice in electoral matters guidelines and explanatory report adopted by the venice commission at its session venice october equality of opportunity equality of opportunity must be guaranteed for parties and candidates alike this entails a neutral attitude by state authorities in particular with regard to the election campaign coverage by the media in particular by the publicly owned media public funding of parties and campaigns freedom of voters to form an opinion state authorities must observe their duty of neutrality in particular this concerns media billposting the right to demonstrate funding of parties and candidates explanatory report equality of opportunity equality of opportunity should be ensured between parties and candidates and should prompt the state to be impartial towards them and to apply the same law uniformly to all in particular the neutrality requirement applies to the electoral campaign and coverage by the media especially the publicly owned media as well as to public funding of parties and campaigns this means that there are two possible interpretations of equality either strict equality or proportional equality strict equality means that the political parties are treated without regard to their present strength in parliament or among the electorate it must apply to the use of public facilities for electioneering purposes for example bill posting postal services and similar public demonstrations public meeting rooms proportional equality implies that the treatment of political parties is in proportion to the number of votes equality of opportunity strict and/or proportional applies in particular to radio and television airtime public funds and other forms of backing certain forms of backing may on the one hand be submitted to strict equality and on the other hand to proportional equality,case originated application russian federation lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention redaktsiya gazety orlovskaya iskra

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by falter zeitschriften gmbh the applicant company on july the applicant company was represented by mr a. noll a lawyer practising in the austrian government the government were represented by their agent mr f. trauttmansdorff head of the international law department at the federal ministry for foreign affairs the applicant company complained about a breach of its rights under article of the convention on may the court decided to give notice of the application to the government under the provisions of article of the convention it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility the applicant company is the owner and publisher of the weekly newspaper falter it has its seat in in the autumn of the police officer mr kleindienst revealed that he and some colleagues had repeatedly transmitted data from the central police computer to officials of the austrian freedom party fpö subsequently criminal investigations were commenced against several persons amongst them mr kabas leader of the branch of the fpö on suspicion of having assisted in abuse of authority amtsmissbrauch on may the vienna public prosecutor 's office closed the file against mr kabas and criminal proceedings against him were discontinued in the autumn of the landesgericht convicted mr kleindienst and the fpö official mr kreiβl and sentenced them to six months imprisonment suspended on probation subsequently in its issue of falter of september the applicant company published the following article spineless justice comment informer trial ends with guilty verdicts shadow cast over public prosecutor 's office the informer affair the case about whether fpö politicians obtained secret data from the police computer system in return for money over a period of many years has provisionally come to a close josef kleindienst the former fpö police trade unionist who set the case in motion with a full confession and the police officer michael kreißl the former right-hand man of the leader of the vienna branch of the fpö hilmar kabas were given six-month suspended prison sentences among other things they had disclosed official secrets concerning a drugs raid allowing the vienna fpö the time to publish press advertisements stirring up feelings against nigerians the judgments are not yet final the trial was highly instructive at the hearing the public prosecutor michael klackl spoke for the first time of revealing insight into the handling of sensitive police data and criticised the alarming networking between politicians he presumably did not dare to say fpö ed and the police josef kleindienst whose detailed statements on the informing system within the fpö were nevertheless considered much too vague by the ministry of justice headed by mr haider 's friend dieter böhmdörfer to justify bringing charges against high-ranking fpö politicians was described by the independent criminal judge kurt wachsmann in the reasoning of the judgment as a person of absolute credibility how strange why then were no other high-ranking fpö politicians put in the dock why were the proceedings against jörg haider ewald stadtler karl schnell and other accused fpö officials not energetically pursued even though the credible kleindienst had so heavily incriminated them why were the proceedings against the beneficiaries of the informers services the politicians discontinued at a time when not even all the witnesses had been examined why did they never have to appear in a public arena before an independent judge even though they had boasted in parliament that they had access to secret police files could it have been because of political pressure because of threats by the fpö leadership against public prosecutors judges and investigators the public prosecutor 's office is not required to justify itself the notes it keeps in its so-called journals are secret the informer affair involves much more than just a few corrupt police officers and a web of officials journalists and politicians who for years went unpunished in downloading secret material about political opponents from the police computer system and distributing it among themselves with a view to making public attacks especially in the kronen zeitung on people they did not like the facts of the case suggest that the public prosecutor 's office allowed itself to be intimidated that it made such extensive use of its discretionary powers in assessing a witness 's credibility that independent judges were left out of the picture at no time did the prosecutors entrust the preliminary investigation of the case to an independent investigating judge as they would in the case of any common shoplifter they constantly sought to remain in charge of the proceedings in the context of preliminary inquiries the public prosecutor 's office was anxious about digging its teeth into the angry fpö senior politicians whose counsel as the minister for justice was also the highest representative of the state prosecution service it will not bite barking dogs the bourgeois revolutions of the nineteenth century spawned the institution of the independent judge the search for justice was henceforth supposed to take place in the courtrooms and not in political cabinets to this day judges can not be removed from office are not subject to any instructions and are supposed to represent a third branch of state power which can treat everyone the same above all even the king without having to fear personal consequences however austrian criminal law in practice deprives this fundamental principle of all effect what comes before a judge is decided by the public prosecutor who is subject to instructions from the private office of the minister of justice prosecutors know that their career may depend on the click of a minister 's fingers that turns them into cowering vacillators rather than energetic investigators instead of raking through the muck and carrying out painstaking investigative work they look upwards so as not to fall down justice ministers from all parties know why they do not wish to relinquish their right to issue instructions this brings us to the case of the leader of the branch of the fpö hilmar kabas initially the fraud squad actually wanted him to be detained on remand kleindienst had not only stated that he had been bribed by kabas he also confessed to having handed him a secret file on nuclear crime subsequently according to kleindienst they celebrated this coup over boiled beef in the plachutta restaurant together with a krone reporter the judge believed kleindienst 's version of events and convicted him of abusing his office kabas should really also have been convicted by this stage as the person receiving the file kabas admitted having met at plachutta but denied having taken possession of a file the justice system also believed this version resulting in a grotesque situation in which the person who had handed over the secret file was convicted but the high-ranking official who had received it walked away free at the hearing at which kabas gave evidence under oath as a witness although he could have asserted his right not to do so the fpö agitator was unable to remember any files being handed over the judge observed this is the question can he kabas ed no longer remember after all he does have other things to deal with at present. rarely can possibly false evidence have been downplayed so elegantly the public prosecutor 's office should now at least become active again and investigate kabas either for giving false testimony or for abusing his office the accusations against other leading politicians likewise appear in a new light now why should kleindienst have appeared credible in one case but not in his many other confessions in any event the public prosecutor mr klackl will have another thorough look at the case concerning kabas as a spokesman for the public prosecutor 's office confirmed one thing has become clear after the trial however in proceedings conducted in public by an independent judge the justice system can probe closer to the truth than in secret preliminary proceedings under the sole control of public prosecutors who are subject to instructions the informer affair may be resumed informally at any time all that is required is the political will to allow the judges to do their work the fact that political will is needed for the justice system to start working properly is frankly unacceptable. upon appeal the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht acquitted mr kreiβl and mr kleindienst on february on september mr kabas instituted proceedings claiming compensation and publication of the judgment under section of the media act mediengesetz with the vienna regional criminal court landesgericht für strafsachen he submitted that the following passages of the above article were in violation of his right to be presumed innocent the 'informer affair involves much more than just a few corrupt police officers and a web of officials journalists and politicians who for years went unpunished in downloading secret material about political opponents from the police computer system and distributing it among themselves with a view to making public attacks especially in the kronen zeitung on people they did not like kabas should really also have been convicted by this stage as the person receiving the file a grotesque situation in which the person who had handed over the secret file was convicted but the high-ranking official who had received it walked away free the public prosecutor 's office should now at least become active again and investigate kabas either for giving false testimony or for abusing his office the discontinued these proceedings on october it noted that mr kabas had been subject of preliminary investigations vorerhebungen relating to the police information affair which had been discontinued under section of the code of criminal procedure strafprozeβordnung however the guarantees of presumption of innocence under section of the media act concerned only a person who was suspected of a criminal offence and was not yet convicted by final judgment it did not apply once the criminal proceedings had been discontinued as from this time onwards any statement of a private person which was in violation with the presumption of innocence of another person constituted defamation under section of the media act upon mr kabas complaint the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht on june quashed this decision and remitted the case to the it noted that section of the media act protected any person suspected of a criminal offence regardless of the state of criminal proceedings and whether the person was suspected by official authorities having regard to the article as a whole and the impugned passages in particular the court found that the conditions of applying section of the media act to the present case were met having held a hearing the on july found that the impugned passages were in breach of the presumption of mr kabas innocence as guaranteed under section of the media act it therefore ordered the applicant company to pay euros eur in compensation to mr kabas to publish the judgment and to pay mr kabas costs of the proceedings it found that the article taken as a whole was based on the assumption that there were persons whose guilt was established but only some of them were prosecuted the article 's statements concerning the misconduct of the public prosecutor 's office and the minister of justice could only be understood in the way that the public prosecutor 's office against its better judgment had refrained from prosecuting clearly guilty criminal offenders the article suggested that mr kleindienst 's statement heavily charged mr kabas and conveyed that if everything was perfectly above-board mr kabas should now also be convicted by calling the situation that mr kabas was not convicted grotesque the article not only established the juridical not maintainable presumption that a person who had received a file obtained in abuse of office had also committed an offence but also suggested that this dealing with the matter was against all legal practice the article conveyed to the reader that under duly conducted criminal prosecution the filing of an indictment against mr kabas and his conviction would merely be a matter of form this message was presented as quasi established fact which was strengthened by the repeated reference to the judge who had considered mr kleindienst 's statements as absolutely credible the reader was given the impression that mr kabas was undoubtedly guilty and that his conviction was inevitable the article had therefore crossed the threshold of the simple utterance of suspicion against mr kabas on october the applicant company appealed against the judgment referring in particular to article of the convention on march the vienna court of appeal confirmed the 's judgment it noted that the expression of an opinion about the public prosecutor office 's role in the informer affair proceedings and criticism on the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings against mr kabas fell under the applicant company 's right under article of the convention but in the present case the impugned article went further and portrayed mr kabas as established guilty section of the media act mediengesetz is entitled protection of the presumption of innocence schutz der unschuldsvermutung and as in force at the relevant time read as follows a person suspected of having committed an offence but not yet convicted by final judgment who is portrayed in a medium as being guilty or as the perpetrator of the offence and not only as a suspect is entitled to claim compensation from the media owner for the insult suffered the amount of compensation shall not exceed eur there shall be no right to compensation if a true report about a hearing at a public session of the national assembly the federal council the federal assembly the diet of a land or a committee of these general representative bodies is concerned a true report about a

the case originated in an application no against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr maksim sergeyevich rebechenko the applicant or mr r. on december the applicant was represented by mr a. zabaznov the russian government the government were initially represented by mr g. matyushkin representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights and then by his successor in that office mr m. galperin on september notice of the application was given to the government the applicant was born in and lives in voronezhskaya krasnodar region in summer ms f. the head of the ust-labinskiy district and of the non-governmental organisation human rights defender spoke at a television talk show on the situation in the eastern region of ukraine and relations between russia and ukraine on july the applicant published on youtube a video with the title kolkhoz tv on ukrainian crisis колхозное телевидение об украинском кризисе where he made comments on ms f. s speech as follows ms f. nobody in the whole world has ever thought that russia would become such a strong country and that russia would reach new horizons the applicant mr r. nodding ironically showing the brochure life of a galley slave ms f. would organise worldwide renowned olympic games mr r. nodding ironically showing brochure winter olympic games in subtropics ms f. and would host the eurovision competition and at the same time would become a leading leader among gases станет лидирующим лидером среди газа mr r. yet today according to the latest reports of the mendeleyev international rating agency russia has reached the top of the list drawing ahead of such gases as carbon hydrogen and oxygen ms f. there is a war against russia which has become a first-rate power and everybody is annoyed by this fact they want us to die of drug and alcohol abuse and poverty etc mr r. but it is not true that we die of alcohol drugs and poverty poverty ms f. ukraine is so to say our russian belly mr r. i am afraid of asking what the far east is ms f. and that s why we must certainly help these people who have found themselves in a horrible situation because kyiv to be honest does not need these people it needs gas mr r. but who is ‘ the leading leader among gases that means they need russia ms f. so slavyansk means gas mr r. slavyansk means gas as we know gas means russia this proves that slavyansk belongs to us on lawful grounds in fact it does not ms f. we must not get involved in a war mr r. wait you have said that a war has been declared on us how can we not get involved in the war if we have been drawn into the war as everybody knows by bulgarians ms f. we may not interfere with what is happening in ukraine yes we are sorry yes people die there as has previously been said what if our people go there and die mr r. i would recommend that this woman go to mothers of russian soldiers in particular those who had been dismissed from the service or who were on leave and who returned from ukraine in coffins so she could tell them that we did not interfere and that we do not have troops there ms f. and if now the economic situation in the country worsens and russian people seek to rebel we are already under pressure from various religious conventions конвенций which have infiltrated the country even in krasnodar region there are many such protestant so to say religious cults as i call them which influence people s minds mr r. what beep you are talking about ms f. i guess they are now trying to convince us ideologically that if we are not happy with regional authorities decisions we need to organise rallies revolutions etc i believe that we must not take the bait mr r. because this breaks with long traditions and principles to stay in a horsebox and eat all this sh coming from the television ms f. we all including all human rights defenders need to work together as a team mr r. a person who claims to be a human rights defender must know what human rights are now you have an idea of what is happening inside the heads of those who watch television next patient please on january ms f. brought an action against the applicant stating that he had offended her and had harmed her reputation on january the ust-labinskiy district court of the krasnodar region allowed her claim the court held as follows the applicant disseminated untrue statements about ms f. which damaged her honour dignity and reputation because these statements referred to unethical behaviour on her part the court has established that the defendant used abusive and obscene language in his video therefore the applicant intended to humiliate ms f. and damage her reputation ms f. the head of the ust-labinsk district has sustained damage of a nonpecuniary nature due to emotional distress caused by the defendant s defamatory and discrediting statements and allusions to her unethical conduct in accordance with the principle of reasonableness taking into account the seriousness of the wrongful acts the nature of the offence and the contents of the publication the degree of suffering involved and that the information concerned a public activist and was available for the general public the court allows the plaintiff s claim for nonpecuniary damage in part and awards roubles ‘ rub on february the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of january he submitted that he had not offended ms f. but had rather commented on her statements regarding the situation in ukraine nor had he disseminated any untruths relating to ms f. as to obscene words the applicant had used only one word meaning prostitute however this word had been an interjection rather than an offence and had been bleeped out the applicant emphasised that the first-instance court had established that ms f. was a public person who should tolerate critics but had still issued a decision violating freedom of political speech on may the krasnodar regional court upheld this decision on appeal stating that the applicant had failed to provide any proof in respect of statements about ms f. used in his video and that he had used vulgar and obscene words humiliating ms f. on august and november the krasnodar regional court and the supreme court of russia dismissed the applicant s cassation appeals article of the russian constitution guarantees freedom of expression under article of the civil code of russia

activity of journalists of the criminal code and transferred to the sabail district prosecutor s office on january the applicant was questioned by the investigator in charge of the case the applicant stated that he had been beaten with truncheons by a group of police officers while he was observing the demonstration as a journalist the applicant also stated that he did not know the police officers who had hit him although he did know the police officers who were in charge of the police unit the applicant submitted a photo of an officer a.v who was the head of the riot police regiment of the baku police office the applicant s version of the events was also confirmed by statements from two other journalists e.m. and n.a. who were present at the relevant time at the place of the incident according to the government on january the investigator ordered a forensic examination of the applicant but the applicant did not appear for this examination no copy of any decision in this respect was submitted by the government to the court the applicant alleged that he had not been informed of this decision by the investigator by a letter of february the investigator in charge of the case requested the sabail district police department to identify the police officers who had hit the applicant in reply to the investigator s letter on february the head of the sabail district police department wrote that they had not been able to identify the relevant police officers however they would continue to take measures in this respect and inform the investigator of any result on march the investigator heard a.v. who denied involvement in the applicant s beating a.v stated that neither he nor the police officers under his supervision had done anything unlawful to the applicant in his presence on march the sabail district prosecutor s office investigator issued a decision suspending the criminal proceedings until the perpetrators of the beating had been identified the investigator relied on the fact that the police officers allegedly involved in the applicant s beating had not been identified as to a.v. s alleged involvement the investigator relied on a.v. s statements noting that the latter had not carried out any unlawful actions against the applicant the applicant was not provided with any information concerning the criminal investigation until may on may the applicant contacted the sabail district prosecutor s office investigator and inquired about the state of the proceedings the investigator informed him that the criminal investigation had been suspended on march but did not provide the applicant with a copy of the decision suspending the investigation on may the applicant lodged a complaint with the sabail district court he complained that the investigator had failed to provide him with a copy of the decision suspending the investigation thus making it impossible for him to lodge a proper complaint against it he also asked the court to quash this decision and remit the case for investigation he insisted in particular that the group of police officers who had hit him had been under a.v. s command and that the photo of a.v taken at the time of the incident had been submitted to the police on may the sabail district court dismissed the applicant s complaint finding that the decision suspending the investigation had been lawful and had been sent to the applicant on march the decision was silent as to a.v and his alleged role in the applicant s beating it appears that the court did not hear any witness at the hearing on june the applicant lodged an appeal reiterating his previous complaints in particular he argued that the suspension of the investigation for which the reason given was that it was impossible to identify the policemen who had beaten him was wrong and that the investigation authorities knew who the perpetrators were in this connection he noted that he and other journalists had specifically identified a.v. who was present at the scene of the incident at the relevant time on june the court of appeal dismissed the applicant s appeal and upheld the sabail district court s decision of may on november the applicant lodged a separate civil action against the ministry of internal affairs asking for compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by his beating on october he relied on articles and of the convention on november the sabail district court refused to admit the action for non-compliance with the formal requirements the court held that the applicant had failed in particular to provide a forensic report showing the cause of the injuries and had not supplied a copy of any document showing that a police officer had been found responsible for the applicant s beating the court also noted that the applicant had failed to identify actual individuals rather than the ministry of internal affairs in general as defendants on december the applicant appealed

the case originated in an application no against the swiss confederation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a swiss national mr daniel monnat the applicant on june the applicant was represented by mr c. poncet a lawyer practising in the swiss government the government were represented by their agent mr p. boillat former deputy director of the federal office of justice in charge of the human rights and council of europe section on october the court decided to give notice of the application to the government under the provisions of article of the convention it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility the applicant was born in and lives in he is a journalist with the swiss radio and television company at the material time he was responsible for the current affairs programme temps présent present tense on and march as part of that programme the swiss radio and television company broadcast on its channel for french-speaking switzerland tsr télévision suisse romande a report by the applicant entitled switzerland s lost honour concerning s position during the second world war the report began by discussing the history of during the second world war as supposedly experienced by the people at the time and taught for many years in schools had been portrayed as a brave country which despite its neutrality had been on the side of democracy and thus of the allies after this recounting of the myth the journalist stated there has been a somewhat rude awakening. the programme continued with severe criticism of s position by prominent figures and with contrasting opinions of swiss citizens who had lived through the war the journalist said that historians had made efforts to uncover a significant part of the truth the programme then described the attitude of switzerland and its leaders emphasising their alleged affinity with the far right and their inclination towards rapprochement with this was followed by an analysis of the question of anti-semitism in switzerland and of the country s economic relations with germany focusing on the laundering of nazi money by and on the role of swiss banks and insurance companies in the matter of unclaimed jewish assets the programme provoked objections from groups of citizens who filed complaints under section of the federal radio and television act see paragraph below with the independent complaints authority for radio and television the complaints authority in the course of its investigation into the complaints the complaints authority interviewed two historians it subsequently upheld the complaints on october and asked the swiss radio and television company to inform it within ninety days of being notified of its decision of the measures taken to redress the breach it had found in accordance with section of the federal radio and television act see paragraph below the swiss radio and television company appealed against the decision on december the federal court allowed the appeal holding that there had been a breach of the right to a hearing quashed the decision appealed against and referred the case back to the complaints authority for a fresh decision on august the complaints authority after holding a hearing with the parties in private again upheld the citizens complaints it observed that where the events in issue are part of history their presentation by journalists is bound to involve difficulties witnesses are increasingly rare certain aspects of the social context that might have explained the conduct of the time become blurred the complaints authority held that the programme had breached the broadcasting regulations deriving from section of the federal radio and television act by which current affairs programmes were bound by a duty to report objectively in such a way as to reflect the plurality and diversity of opinion it pointed out that the second subsection of section also provided that personal views should be identifiable as such the complaints authority accordingly found against the swiss radio and television company requesting it to indicate the measures taken to redress the breach in accordance with section of the federal radio and television act on january the swiss radio and television company the applicant and a historian who had been involved in the report applied to the federal court to have the decision of august set aside in a judgment of november served on december the federal court declared the application inadmissible in respect of the applicant on the ground that although he had produced the report he was not entitled to take part in the proceedings since he was not personally a victim of the decision of august in respect of the swiss radio and television company the federal court considered the application on the merits it held that although politically committed journalism was not prohibited in itself it should be identifiable as such in the present case the journalist had conveyed his support for one particular viewpoint through harsh criticism in short the federal court did not object to the programme s content but rather to the fact that the method used namely politically committed journalism had not been identified as such it pointed out that journalism of that nature was subject to particularly stringent rules of diligence which the programme had not observed the journalist should have informed viewers that the report was not presenting an indisputable truth but rather one possible interpretation of relations between switzerland and the federal court accordingly dismissed the swiss radio and television company s application the relevant parts of the judgment read as follows b the impugned programme concerns a historical subject s position during the second world war which has returned to prominence on account of the issue of unclaimed assets by broadcasting a programme on a matter of public debate the swiss radio and television company was performing the role assigned to it and it has rightly not been criticised on that account because of its historical aspect the programme in issue was faced with a problem regarding sources witnesses to the events recounted are becoming increasingly rare and certain elements that might have explained the conduct of the time are becoming blurred as was noted in the decisions complained of accordingly the explanation of historical facts relies on hypotheses that may serve as a basis for the construction of theories in such circumstances journalists must test their hypotheses and where appropriate adjust them even if they are not expected to reveal an absolute truth they must abide by the rules of journalistic diligence accordingly in this context they must in particular indicate any persisting doubts point out contradictions between witness accounts and mention the differing interpretations supported by some historians on account of its topical nature the programme in issue contributes to a debate and may be described as politically committed journalism in the sense referred to above it has to satisfy particularly stringent requirements of journalistic diligence since it expresses criticism that may be especially painful it is necessary to assess whether the rules of diligence applicable in the present case have been complied with bearing in mind that such an assessment must take into account the situation obtaining at the time when the impugned programme was broadcast a the impugned programme entitled ‘ switzerland s lost honour begins by discussing the history of switzerland during the second world war as supposedly experienced by the people at the time and taught for many years in schools had been depicted as a small brave country which had resisted the demoniac forces of nazism despite being neutral in their hearts the swiss had been on the side of democracy in other words the allies they had deterred the nazis from attacking them through their determination to resist if necessary with the help of the réduit a kind of impregnable fortress in the alps they had displayed generosity by welcoming more than people who had fled the extermination camps and by temporarily receiving child war victims had introduced banking secrecy so that jews could store their savings safely in the country after this recounting of the ‘ myth the journalist states ‘ there has been a somewhat rude awakening. the programme continues with severe criticism of switzerland s position during the second world war by prominent figures most of them jewish and with contrasting opinions of swiss citizens who lived through the period and young people who know about it only through the ‘ myth the journalist then asserts that in the past twenty-five years historians studying the period have uncovered a significant part of the truth next the programme describes the attitude of switzerland and in particular its political and military leaders during the second world war emphasising their alleged affinity with the far right and their inclination towards rapprochement with germany the question of swiss anti-semitism is then examined along with the economic and financial relations between switzerland and the programme alleges that the réduit served germany s economic interests and focuses on the laundering of nazi money by and on the role of swiss banks and insurance companies in the matter of unclaimed jewish assets the journalist concludes by saying ‘ the experts of the volcker commission and the historians of the bergier commission will no doubt confirm that the swiss political and economic elite in this difficult period adapted to the circumstances rather too well their biggest mistake was probably their failure to acknowledge and come to terms with that attitude after the war to acknowledge that the swiss were not heroes but normal people caught up in events who succeeded in taking advantage for themselves and their descendants of the most appalling global crisis of the twentieth century. b the complaints authority which did not criticise the content of the programme in issue found that the swiss radio and television company had breached section of the federal radio and television act by using a method described as politically committed journalism in the decisions under review which had not allowed viewers to form their own opinion the company had not observed the principles of journalistic diligence since it had never suggested that there were differing views among the historians who had distanced themselves from the ‘ myth that had built up with regard to switzerland s position during the second world war c the swiss radio and television company disputes that the programme in issue can be regarded as politically committed journalism which is subject to particularly stringent rules of diligence it argues that in any event the programme complied with such rules the company also complains of a misuse of discretionary power it accuses the relevant authority of having reaffirmed the conclusions of its decisions of october despite the fact that the additional investigation had virtually demolished the reasoning on which they were based and of having acted arbitrarily by assuming the role of the ultimate authority on historical science a as the complaints authority noted the programme in issue sets the ‘ myth against the ‘ truth which historians have brought to light without indicating the disagreements existing between them in various spheres such as the basis of switzerland s economic relations with nazi germany the purpose of the réduit or the explanation of switzerland s independence it makes no reference to differing views despite the fact that opinion on these matters is far from unanimous as the complaints authority showed similarly the decisions under review observe that the programme in issue merely provides one explanation for the conduct of a prominent figure such as general guisan without mentioning that there are other explanations that are just as valid if not more so while accusing the swiss authorities at least implicitly of having deceived the population for some fifty years with a ‘ myth the impugned programme without admitting as much also gives its own interpretation which is no less categorical this impression is moreover reinforced by interviews in which ordinary men and women who lived through the events under discussion defend the ‘ myth expressing their emotions with varying degrees of articulacy while historians who are expected to have a rigorous grasp of their subject provide the ‘ truth as the complaints authority rightly pointed out the programme in issue ridicules the wartime generation by showing recollections that are incorrect or exaggerated or convey a misplaced sense of self-satisfaction contrasting with the cold logic of the historians this leaves the impression that the interpretation put forward in the programme is corroborated by all specialists and thus reflects the sole historical truth there is therefore a risk that one myth might be replaced by another and only the observance of strict rules of journalistic diligence can prevent such a lapse furthermore the programme does not always place the events it describes in their historical context as precisely as is desirable it takes insufficient account of certain important aspects for example the threats switzerland faced as a result of being surrounded by the axis powers and the position of other neutral or even allied powers for viewers to be able to form an opinion or plays down their significance lastly it does not always enable facts to be distinguished from comment see the speech given on may by kaspar villiger b the swiss radio and television company wrongly asserts that the complaints authority should have had regard to its programmes as a whole in assessing whether the diversity of opinions among historians had been reflected it refers in that connection to the special programme of february on general guisan ‘ switzerland in torment and the debate broadcast on may ‘ switzerland neutral or cowardly in addition it announces that the programme in issue will be followed up in the light of the findings of the commissions set up by the federal council it must be noted however that the impugned programme appears to be self-contained it does not refer to the previous programme of february or to the subsequent one of may furthermore these three programmes were not advertised by the swiss radio and television company as forming a coherent whole and viewers of the programme in issue could not have suspected that it was part of a series if indeed it was c the impugned programme adopts an extremely critical approach towards s position during the second world war as is legitimate however it neglects to mention that it is not revealing ‘ the truth but one of several different interpretations of relations between switzerland and during that period accordingly viewers are not provided with all the material enabling them to form their own opinion furthermore the programme in issue lacks objectivity and transparency in that it never mentions either the existence or the essence of other interpretations of s position during the second world war whereas the version it presents is not unanimously supported by historians the complaints authority emphasised the cultural role assigned to the swiss radio and television company the autonomy it enjoys and the conflicts that may arise between these two aspects on that basis it reached the conclusion that the programme in issue had not breached section d of the federal radio and television act the complaints authority then referred to the principles applicable to the provision of information laying particular emphasis on the principle of journalistic diligence it pointed out the difficulties inherent in programmes dealing with historical subjects it also gave a precise definition of its power of review having thus delimited the scope of its intervention the complaints authority undertook an analysis of the impugned programme it examined the programme s structure and the method used to present the subject in addition it conducted research into whether the diversity of views had been reflected with sufficient accuracy following a thorough examination the complaints authority found that the programme in issue had breached section of the federal radio and television act the complaints authority did not exceed or misuse its discretionary power indeed it remained within the scope of the powers conferred on it being precluded as it emphasised itself from stating a position on historical events and their interpretation or on the validity of the views expressed by the historians appearing on the programme in question its criticisms of the swiss radio and television company moreover do not concern the content of the programme but solely the manner in which it presented s position during the second world war to viewers in the final analysis the complaints authority can not be criticised for finding in accordance with federal law that the programme in issue breached section of the federal radio and television act by which article bis paragraph of the former constitution is given statutory expression moreover it is not surprising that the complaints authority should have reached the same conclusions as in its previous decisions of october the additional investigations made it possible to clarify some points regarding the content of the impugned programme without having any bearing on its form or style d the swiss radio and television company is also wrong to complain that its independence has been undermined freedom of opinion of the media and of science it overlooks the fact that the freedom it enjoys is not absolute but is limited by section of the federal radio and television act which the complaints authority is required to apply the complaints authority s review of compliance with that provision can not therefore in itself undermine the company s independence a the swiss radio and television company alleges that the decisions complained of infringe article of the european convention on human rights echr this provision guarantees freedom of expression which includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas article echr this freedom is not absolute article echr b according to the case-law restrictions on the freedom of expression enshrined in this provision are acceptable if they are prescribed by law based on a legitimate aim under article echr and necessary in a democratic society to achieve that aim see the unreported judgment of january in the case of b. v. direction générale de l entreprise des ptt suisses point b furthermore with regard to freedom of expression article echr does not guarantee any greater protection than unwritten constitutional law atf judgments of the swiss federal court ia point p. point p. ia point p. the federal court has also pointed out that article echr does not afford more extensive protection than section of the federal radio and television act to broadcasters in so far as they are entitled to rely on it the freedom it affords to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority includes the freedom of radio and television broadcasting but this freedom is not unlimited atf ii point p. c the swiss radio and television company s complaint must be dismissed the complaints authority s criticisms of the company pursue a legitimate aim under article echr since they seek to protect the right of viewers to receive objective and transparent information in the light of the foregoing the applications must be refused in so far as they are admissible. in a letter of february the swiss radio and television company informed the complaints authority of the measures taken in accordance with section of the federal radio and television act as a result of the complaints authority s decision of august upheld by the federal court in its judgment of november further to this procedure two preliminary remarks must be made as a result of the procedure conducted in by the complaints authority following the federal court s judgment of december the swiss radio and television company had the opportunity to put forward its point of view and no factual errors could be identified in the programme in question see also the federal court s judgment of november p. since the criticisms no longer related to the content of the programme in addition the complaints authority emphasised the critical function that broadcasters by their very nature are also required to perform as the federal court also confirmed in its judgment of november p. and the difficulty inherent in the genre of programmes on historical subjects further to the decisions by your authority as upheld by the federal court we hereby give you formal notice of the following measures taken in accordance with section subsection of the federal radio and television act as instructed in your decisions the decisions have been communicated to the news editors conference which has taken note of them the conference has drawn attention to the manner in which sensitive subjects of a highly emotive nature are to be dealt with and to the need to take into account the public impact using as an example the procedure and decisions in question here it has also been specifically agreed that in the coverage of sensitive subjects as in the programme in question where there are ‘ differing views among historians or other participants see the federal court s judgment of november pp and the authority s decisions paragraphs and such differences are to be appropriately indicated although as the authority itself states in its decisions paragraph this does not require the ‘ tiniest nuances to be taken into account lastly the decisions have been incorporated into all the swiss radio and television company s training courses in its reply of march the complaints authority stated that it found the measures taken to be adequate and would no longer propose taking the measures referred to in section of the federal radio and television act it thereby declared the procedure closed on may the competent bailiff of the city of geneva drew up an official report attesting that the broadcast had been placed under a legal embargo and that as a result it was not possible to obtain a copy of it from the tsr sales department or from any european or foreign television channel article of the federal constitution provides article radio and television legislation on radio and television and on other forms of

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a french association named ekin the applicant association on january the applicant association was represented by its counsel the french government the government were represented by their agent the applicant association alleged a violation of article of the convention taken alone and in conjunction with article on account of the application of section of the law of july as amended under which the sale of one of its publications was prohibited throughout for a period of more than nine years relying on article of the convention the applicant association further complained that the proceedings had been excessively lengthy it also alleged a violation of article of the convention on the ground that it had not had access to an expedited procedure before an administrative court whereby the court could review the ban on the book and if necessary promptly lift it on september the commission decided to give notice of the application to the government the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the third section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule mr j.-p. costa the judge elected in respect of withdrew from sitting in the case rule the government accordingly appointed mr g. braibant to sit as an ad hoc judge on september the chamber decided to invite the parties to present oral observations on the admissibility and merits of the application at a hearing the hearing took place in public in the on january rule there appeared before the court the court heard addresses by them after the deliberations held following the hearing of january the chamber declared the application admissible note by the registry the court s decision is obtainable from the registry the applicant association and the government each filed written observations on the merits of the case rule in the applicant association published a book entitled euskadi at war there were four versions basque english spanish and french and the book was distributed in numerous countries including and according to the applicant association this was a collective work containing contributions from a number of academics with specialist knowledge of the basque country and giving an account of the historical cultural linguistic and socio-political aspects of the basque cause it ended with a political article entitled euskadi at war a promise of peace by the basque national liberation movement the book was published in the second quarter of on april a ministerial order was issued by the french ministry of the interior under section of the law of july as amended by the decree of on june the applicant association lodged an administrative appeal against the ban when this was implicitly rejected it appealed to the on november the held that it did not have jurisdiction and so referred the case to the conseil d etat by a decision of january the president of the judicial division of the conseil d etat remitted the case to the in a judgment delivered on june after a public hearing in the presence of both parties the rejected the applicant association s appeal on the following grounds it has been established that the book at issue entitled euskadi at war was printed in that four of its five chapters were written by authors of spanish nationality and that the documentation used for the preparation of the publication was mainly of spanish origin therefore and notwithstanding the fact that the book was published by the applicant association which is based in the offending book must be regarded as of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions accordingly the minister of the interior was legally entitled to prohibit the book s circulation distribution and sale in taking the view that the book at issue could pose a threat to public order since it argued particularly in chapter that the violence of the spanish state justified the eta terrorist organisation s ‘ proportionate counter-offensive the minister of the interior did not make any obvious error in assessing the evidence under article of the european convention on human rights ‘ e veryone has the right to freedom it is the task of the administrative courts to assess whether any restriction of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the above-mentioned article is proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued and to assess whether the ban on a publication of foreign origin is in keeping with that aim in the instant case the evidence does not show that the general prohibition of the book at issue was disproportionate to the public-order objectives being pursued the applicant association lodged an appeal against this judgment with the conseil d etat on august in its further observations it asked the conseil d etat to find that section of the law of july as amended was incompatible with articles and of the convention taken together on july the conseil d etat ruled that section of the law of as amended was not incompatible with articles and of the convention on the following grounds under section of the law of july as amended by the decree of may ‘ the circulation distribution or sale in of newspapers or texts written in a foreign language whether periodicals or not may be prohibited by a decision of the minister of the interior newspapers and texts of foreign origin written in french and printed abroad or in may also be prohibited in the absence of any statutory provision establishing the conditions circumscribing the legality of decisions taken on the basis of this provision any restrictions of the minister s power derive from the need to reconcile the general interests for which he is responsible with the respect due to public freedoms particularly freedom of the press when an appeal against such a prohibition order is lodged with an administrative court it is duty-bound to assess whether the banned publication poses such a threat to these general interests that it warrants an infringement of public freedoms contrary to the applicant association s assertions the power thus exercised by the minister of the interior under the supervision of the courts is not incompatible with the combined provisions of articles and of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms … on the other hand the conseil d etat quashed the judgment and the ministerial order of april on the following grounds by the impugned order the minister of the interior prohibited the circulation distribution and sale of the collective work euskadi at war which must be viewed as a written text of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned section of the law of july having regard to the interests that the minister is responsible for protecting in particular public safety and public order the court finds that the content of this publication does not provide sufficient legal justification for the serious infringement of press freedom embodied in the impugned decision it follows from the above considerations that the association ekin has good grounds for maintaining that the pau administrative court was wrong to reject by means of the impugned judgment the association s application to set aside the decision of april taken on the basis of the aforementioned section of the law of july by which the minister of the interior prohibited the circulation distribution and sale in france of the book entitled euskadi at war published by the association in a registered letter with recorded delivery received by the ministry of the interior on december the applicant association presented the minister with a claim for compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the application of the unlawful order of april for more than nine years according to the applicant association the implementation of this order amounted to tortious conduct on the part of the authority it estimated the overall losses it had sustained at french francs frf including frf resulting from the financial loss deriving directly from the prohibition of sales of the book throughout to date it has not had any reply from the minister of the interior under the rules of french administrative proceedings this silence counts as a refusal of the applicant association s claim the general rules governing the freedom of the press guaranteed by article of the declaration of the rights of man and the citizen which has constitutional status are mainly based on the law of july as amended which established a repressive system so called because any offences that may have been committed are punished and any damage caused is made good ex post facto this is the principle laid down by the law of july as amended when it states in section that anyone may print or sell books and other publications and in section that any newspaper or periodical may be published without prior authorisation or the payment of any security the french rules governing publications do nonetheless include forms of prior intervention which can lead to bans or seizures but are always subject to respect for the principle that they must be proportionate to the facts which prompt them such measures are justified only by the need to protect public order against any unrest caused or liable to be caused by the distribution or sale of a publication the conseil d etat ruled on july abbé de kervenoael d.p that the provisions of sections et seq of the law of july do not prevent mayors from taking measures under their general policing powers for the preservation of order and calm and that it is therefore their duty to prohibit the distribution on the public highway of written documents likely to cause unrest nonetheless as was established in a judgment of the jurisdiction disputes court of april l action française d.p conclusions by josse note by waline these means may only be deployed if there is no other way of preserving or restoring public order they must also be proportionate to the disorder and limited in their duration and geographical scope to what is strictly necessary under section of the law an investigating judge may order the seizure of written or printed documents placards or notices under the conditions laid down in the code of criminal procedure and in the cases contemplated in sections and and of the law these cases are incitement to or vindication of crimes section inciting military personnel to disobey orders section and insulting heads of state and government and foreign diplomats sections and section of the law states if there is a conviction the court may in the cases contemplated in sections and and order the confiscation of any written or printed documents placards or notices seized and at any event order the seizure and suppression or destruction of any copies put on sale distributed or displayed in public suppression or destruction may however apply only to certain parts of the seized copies. in addition section of the law of july as amended adds that in cases of sentences passed under sections and or –penalising incitement to or vindication of crimes and penalising the offence of spreading false news the suspension of the newspaper or periodical may be ordered in the same judgment for a period not exceeding three months administrative review has also been introduced in respect of certain specific types of publication the main categories concerned are publications intended for young people or which may pose a threat to young people and publications which are of foreign origin or drafted in a foreign language this is chiefly the result of implementing the law of july which established the specific rules governing publications intended for young people which may be applied to all publications posing a threat to this type of reader these rules which stem from a desire to protect young people are in fact twofold in nature since they relate both to publications mainly intended for children and adolescents and to publications of all types that may pose a threat to young people a system of administrative supervision also operates pursuant to section of the law of july as amended by the decree of may which reads as follows the circulation distribution or sale in of newspapers or texts written in a foreign language whether periodicals or not may be prohibited by a decision of the minister of the interior newspapers and texts of foreign origin written in french and printed abroad or in may also be prohibited when performed knowingly the sale distribution or reproduction of banned newspapers or written texts shall be punishable by a one-year prison sentence and a fine of francs the same applies if the publication of a banned newspaper or written text is resumed under a different title in this case however the fine shall be increased to francs all copies and reproductions of banned newspapers and written texts and of any which resume publication under a different title shall be liable to administrative seizure. case-law has fleshed out the conditions for the application of this rule it has both defined the concept of foreign origin and established the grounds on which publications can be banned wherever they are not laid down by statute the test used by the administrative courts to determine whether a publication is of foreign origin is made up of a number of strands woven together into the theory of convergent evidence according to the submissions of mr genevois the government commissioner in the case of the minister of the interior v. s.a. librairie françois maspero conseil d etat ce ass. june a.j p. the conseil d etat takes account of both material and intellectual factors the material factors are those relating to the conditions in which the text was printed even if it was printed abroad a book written in french by a french author can be considered to be of foreign origin only if it is established that foreign assistance made possible or helped to make possible its production or publication the intellectual factors relate to the inspiration and the content of the book it was on the basis of such factors that the conseil d etat held that a publication which presented itself either as the french edition of a foreign publication or as the french edition of the texts and articles contained in that publication should be regarded as being of foreign origin within the meaning of section even though the publishers were french ce ass. november s.a. librairie françois maspero p. the conseil d etat has regarded all the following factors as indications of a publication s foreign origin the author s nationality and place of residence ce july monus p. the fact that the publication was a translation ce february sté les editions de la terre du feu p. the nationality of the publisher and the country in which the text was published ce ass. november cited above the country in which it was published or printed ce sect. july alata p. the fact that foreign assistance was provided ce sect. june barbier p. or foreign documentation and inspiration none of these factors suffices alone for instance the fact that the author is a foreign national is not enough in itself for section to be applicable the status of the publication is decided on by considering all of these indications taken together although the law did not indicate the grounds on which it should be applied the case-law of the conseil d etat has established the rule that section can be applied only for certain reasons relating to the public interest and public order initially the administrative courts did not carry out any review of the assessment of the facts warranting the measure nor a fortiori did they consider the proportionality of the measure they checked whether the reasons given by the authorities to justify the use of section were legitimate by ensuring that they duly came within the law s scope see for example ce june joudoux and riaux a.j p. and ce december société olympia press d.j. p. concl braibant the main grounds which the conseil d etat has considered to be among those which can justify in law a measure taken under section of the law of as amended are as follows the protection of public order see for example ce ass. november cited above the immoral nature of the publication concerned see for example ce december cited above and the need to combat racist ideology in particular the revival of national-socialist ideology ce april sté les editions des archers p. applications for judicial review of decisions taken by the minister of the interior under section of the law of may be made to the administrative courts and subsequent appeals lie to the administrative courts of appeal set up by the law of december the minister s decisions can also be quashed by the conseil d etat which acted as the appellate court in such cases before the reform on the other hand stays of execution of bans on publications are not granted by the administrative courts since they consider that the damage caused by the application of such bans is not irreparable and accordingly is not of a nature to justify a stay of execution ce april sieur alata and société des éditions du seuil adja july-august p. the administrative courts begin by carrying out a review of the outward legality of the measures taken under section in other words they consider whether the authorities have respected the rules of jurisdiction procedure and form in so doing they pay particular attention to the grounds for the measure which must comply with the law of july and verify that the rights of the defence as set out in section of the decree of november have been respected this decree which applies to the authors of publications covered by section of the law of as amended and to those whose writings are covered by the law on publications intended for or posing a threat to young people provides that save in exceptional or emergency situations and subject to the requirements of public order such decisions may legally be taken only once the party concerned has been given the opportunity to submit written observations anyone concerned must be heard if he or she so requests by the official responsible for the case or failing that a person authorised to record his or her oral observations such persons may be assisted or represented by a lawyer of their choice secondly the administrative courts also review the internal legality of the measures concerned the scope of which changed on promulgation of the legislative decree of may the conseil d etat has always made sure that the authorities have had good grounds to describe the publication as being of foreign origin that they have made no legal error in the application of the law that they have not based themselves on factually inaccurate evidence and that they have not abused their powers however in their earlier decisions the administrative courts did not review the assessment of the threat posed to public order or the public interest by the publication at issue a major development in the case-law on this matter has occurred since initially in its judicial assembly judgment of november s.a. librairie françois maspero cited above the conseil d etat decided to broaden its review of the legality of ministerial decisions taken under section of the law by extending it to cover manifest errors of judgment that is by checking that a serious error of judgment had not led to a manifest disproportion with the facts that had prompted them then when the applicant association brought the instant case before it the conseil d etat decided to depart from its previous case-law and broaden the scope of its review the effect of the conseil d etat s ruling of july is that the administrative courts must conduct a full review of the grounds for the decision in its judgment the conseil d etat held that it is the administrative courts duty to consider whether the banned publication is likely to cause such damage to the general interests for which the minister is responsible as to

new leadership the applicant was elected general secretary on june the union lodged a complaint against a.p and r.v. former managers and m.m. former secretary of the union who were all teachers alleging theft misappropriation and fraudulent conversion the union complained that the individuals in question had refused to return the union 's property and accounting documents when the new leadership took up its duties and had used them to form a new trade-union organisation in a letter of october the applicant requested on behalf of the union information from the bucharest public prosecutor 's office about the progress of the investigation but received no reply in a further letter of december he renewed his enquiry of the same public prosecutor 's office and also complained about the slowness of the criminal investigation he received no reply to his letter on february the public prosecutor gave a decision discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the union 's complaint lodged against a.p. r.v and m.m that decision was sent on january only to those three individuals in the applicant in his capacity as representative of the union took out a summons against r.v in the court of first instance of the second district of bucharest seeking an order under articles and of the civil code governing civil liability to return to the union romanian lei rol in union subscription fees on an unknown date the applicant had a conversation with a journalist during which he expressed his dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the criminal investigation on march the following article was published in the tineretul liber free youth newspaper the primary and secondary school teachers union of the second district of bucharest is the most militant union because it battles against everyone to ensure respect for the law and teachers rights those are the assertions of mihail constantinescu a teacher at m.s school who tells us i have lodged a complaint against the bucharest schools inspectorate inspectoratul for failure to comply with the collective bargaining agreement the hearing has been listed for april we will be lodging a complaint against the police and the public prosecutor 's office who are engaging in anti-union activities by slowing down the criminal investigation in respect of certain delapidatori persons found guilty of fraudulent conversion r.v. a.p. m.m. teachers in the second district we have at our disposal against them written evidence and confessions by two of them to being in possession of a sum of money belonging to the union

of the third district of bucharest the trial took place on february the single-judge court delivered its judgment on march after hearing evidence from six witnesses for the plaintiff and three for the defence from the applicant and from the three teachers the judge acquitted the applicant he noted that on the date on which the article in question had appeared the three teachers had been the subject of a criminal investigation in connection with a charge of fraudulent conversion and that they had not been informed of the decision discontinuing the proceedings until after the article had appeared that is on january furthermore the judge noted it was not disputed that the teachers had not returned certain sums of money belonging to the union accordingly he considered that the applicant had not had any intention of libelling the teachers but merely of informing the public that his union was going to lodge a complaint against the police and the public prosecutor 's office accused of slowing down the criminal investigation concerning the three teachers a.p. r.v and m.m appealed to the bucharest county court which upheld their appeal the court quashed the decision of march and decided to re-try the case on the merits the trial took place on september the court can not establish from the documents in its possession whether the applicant 's lawyer was able to make oral submissions however his lawyer submitted in the written pleadings in defence that his client had expressed himself on behalf of the union that the aim pursued was that of reconstituting the union 's assets and that the new trade-union organisation formed by the three teachers had been declared illegal by the courts he referred to the evidence given by the witnesses before the court of first instance testifying to negligence on the part of the three teachers in the administration of the union 's property and to their refusal to return certain sums of money and documents he added that the article had distorted the applicant 's statements to the journalists but that the applicant did not want to sue the press although the applicant was present at the trial the court did not hear submissions from him no evidence was adduced the record of the hearing did not mention the public prosecutor 's submission allegedly requesting the applicant 's acquittal but merely indicated that the parties lawyers had been able to address the court the decision was reserved until october and then until october on which date it was delivered in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer the court held that the applicant had intended to injure the honour and reputation of the three teachers contrary to article of the criminal code since his remarks had been published in the newspaper after the decision of february discontinuing the proceedings the court also noted that after that date the applicant had gone to the schools at which a.p. r.v and m.m taught and accused them of running off with the union 's money the applicant was convicted of criminal libel fined rol and ordered to pay rol to each of the three teachers for non-pecuniary damage the applicant appealed on october on november the bucharest court of appeal declared his appeal inadmissible on the ground that no appeal lay against the decision in question and that it was final on an unknown date the applicant paid the three teachers the sums which he had been ordered to pay them on march he paid the rol fine on an unknown date the applicant requested the procurator-general at the supreme court of justice to lodge an application to have the judgment of october set aside on may the applicant was informed that the procurator-general had refused to lodge an application to have the judgment set aside in a judgment of january the bucharest county court after examining the case ex officio and in camera delivered a judgment rectifying the clerical errors in the record of the hearing of september and the judgment of october the court amended the record of the hearing of september to record the presence of the public prosecutor l.s. who had requested in his written pleadings that the teachers appeals be upheld and that the applicant be sentenced to a fine for criminal libel and ordered to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage furthermore according to the court the applicant had addressed it last on september the court also decided to rectify the judgment of october so as to record the adjournment of delivery date from to october and the presence at delivery of the public prosecutor l.s the parties were not summoned to attend and were not present at delivery of the judgment on january in a judgment of march the bucharest court of first instance upheld the action for damages brought by the union against r.v in and ordered r.v to return rol plus interest the court noted that r.v had been the treasurer of the union from to and that in that capacity she had received rol in subscriptions from the members of the union during that period the court also noted that after leaving her post r.v had refused to return to the union the documents relating to the deposit of the said sum at the bank so that the union had never been able to retrieve it on january the government provided the commission at its request with a copy of the bucharest county court 's hearings register for and october the register mentions only the adjournment of delivery from to october and the finding of guilt in respect of the applicant in a letter of december the government informed the commission that they could not provide it with a copy of the notes taken by the registrar caietul grefierului during the hearing of september because pursuant to the ministry of justice 's circular no ordinul ministrului registers containing the registrar 's notes are sealed and archived for three years on december the procurator-general at the supreme court of justice lodged an application to have the judgment of october set aside he requested that the applicant be acquitted on the ground that the constituent elements of the offence of libel had not been made out at the hearing on march the government submitted to the court a decision of february of the supreme court of justice granting the application lodged by the procurator-general to have the decision of october set aside and acquitting the applicant on the ground that intent to defame a constituent element of the offence of libel had not been established the government also submitted to the court a copy of a letter of

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr genri markovich reznik the applicant on february the applicant was represented by mr a. makarov a lawyer practising in the russian government the government were represented by mr p. laptev and ms v. milinchuk former representatives of the at the european court of human rights the applicant alleged in particular that his right to freedom of expression had been violated on september the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the applicant was born in and lives in he is a lawyer and president of the moscow city bar on october mr khodorkovskiy a co-owner of the yukos company was charged with criminal offences and placed in custody on october he was transferred to special-purpose remand centre in moscow operating under the authority of the ministry of justice of the hereinafter the remand centre on october a lawyer ms a. accepted to represent mr khodorkovskiy in the criminal proceedings on november ms a. visited her client in the remand centre on leaving the centre she was stopped by a prison inspector mr b. who accused her of carrying unauthorised material that mr khodorkovskiy had given her it appears from a personal inspection report протокол личного досмотра of the same date that mr b examined the belongings and clothing of the lawyer ms a. and seized two documents a printed document concerning the case against mr khodorkovskiy s co-defendant and a torn handwritten note the report was signed by mr b. ms a. and two prison officers who were present during the search the parties agreed that one of them had been a man mr f. the identity and sex of the second officer was in dispute the government claimed that it had been a woman l-va the applicant insisted that it had been a man l-vich the investigators claimed that the note had contained instructions about exercising influence on witnesses and interfering with the investigation on december the ministry of justice asked the moscow city bar to disbar ms a. for acting in breach of the law and the lawyers code of ethics the applicant as president of the moscow city bar publicly criticised the request by the ministry of justice on december the ntv channel invited the applicant and mr buksman the director of the moscow department of the ministry of justice to the talk show the country and the world « страна и мир » for a discussion of the incident involving ms a the debate was broadcast live at about p.m in the first few minutes of the discussion the applicant asked mr buksman about his view on the events and the grounds for making the request for disbarment mr buksman did not give specific answers stating that the issue was not within his competence the presenter then asked the applicant about the relationship between the moscow city bar and the ministry of justice implying that it was rather strained the applicant denied that any tension existed and added i have to say that we have now examined the matter of lawyer a there was no attempt to pass any note from mr khodorkovskiy outside the remand centre there were no grounds for carrying out a search обыск which by the way was performed by men who rummaged шарили about the body of the woman lawyer evidence obtained by criminal or unlawful means has no legal value there is nothing absolutely nothing in ms a. s records that could warrant her disbarment. the presenter then gave the floor to mr buksman who said that there existed a normal professional relationship between the moscow city bar and the ministry of justice the show ended on january remand prison and warders mr b. and mr f. lodged defamation claims against the applicant and the ntv television company with the cheremushkinskiy district court of moscow they claimed that the applicant had falsely stated that male officers had rummaged about ms a. s body and carried out a search on her whereas they had merely inspected her documents since the domestic law made a distinction between a search обыск and an inspection досмотр the applicant s statement amounted to an allegation of a breach of the russian law that was false and damaging both to the professional reputation of the remand prison and to the honour and dignity of its officers they sought a rectification and compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage in the defamation proceedings the district court heard many witnesses and in particular the warders of the remand prison who had taken part in the incident involving counsel a one of them mr l-vich testified as follows i received a phone call and i was invited to take part in the drafting of a report when i arrived ms a. mr b. and mr f. were in the office b. was drafting the report a. snatched a piece of paper and began tearing it apart we removed the document from her i signed the report and left. ms a. described the way in which the documents had been removed from her i was subjected to a humiliating procedure as a woman and as a lawyer they took the materials of the defence away from me by force how is it possible to take the materials without touching me while i was holding onto them could there be any contact other than bodily contact if i was clutching the materials to my chest and the prison employees were tearing them away from me it was not just my hands that they touched they touched the clothing that was covering my body. in the meantime on february the council of the moscow city bar formally rejected the ministry s request for ms a. s disbarment it found in particular that the inspection досмотр carried out on the person of ms a. on november and the seizure of her materials had been unlawful on june the district court gave judgment on the defamation claim finding as follows it was established at the court hearing that on december a televised discussion between mr buksman and the lawyer mr reznik had been broadcast live on the ntv channel the presenters did not edit the text of the interventions by mr buksman or mr reznik mr buksman was connected with the presenter via a direct link the defendant mr reznik was present in the studio it can be seen from a video recording which the court examined that mr buksman and the defendant made statements of a controversial nature the participants put questions to each other and replied to questions from the presenters the court considers that the statements by the defendant mr reznik were simply an expression of his opinion on an event that had attracted public attention and was widely discussed at the time during the show the country and the world on december a public official and a lawyer held a discussion in which they expressed different opinions on the same event the statements by the defendant mr reznik were not offensive and did not damage the plaintiffs honour dignity or professional reputation the defendant in his reply to the presenter s question did not mention either remand prison no or the plaintiffs f. and b the plaintiff remand prison no alleged a violation of the rights of individuals rather than those of prison no in the instant case the statements by the defendant mr reznik did not contain allegations about the plaintiff remand prison no nor did mr reznik s statements damage its reputation it follows that the claims by remand prison no are unlawful and unjustified because the plaintiff seeks the rectification of allegations concerning its employees the claims by the plaintiffs f. and b. are likewise unjustified because the statements by the defendant did not mention any names still less the plaintiff s names moreover there was no mention of their place of work or place of residence or of their appearance or characteristic features their rank or their position the discussion was not accompanied by any photographs or video footage of the plaintiffs nor were their voices broadcast it follows that the defendant s statements did not contain any information damaging to the honour or dignity of mr f. or mr b the court rejects as unfounded the arguments by remand prison no to the effect that the discussion was preceded by footage showing a building with its postal address which could have enabled television viewers to recognise matrosskaya tishina remand prison no neither mr buksman nor mr reznik mentioned remand prison no in their replies moreover it was the ntv channel that decided to broadcast the footage featuring the building with its address at the beginning of the show but the plaintiffs have lodged no defamation claim against the channel having regard to the above-stated the court finds that the claims are unjustified and must be rejected. the remand centre mr b. and mr f. all lodged statements of appeal on august the moscow city court quashed the district court s judgment and granted the defamation claims by all three plaintiffs finding as follows the conclusion of the district court to the effect that the statements made by the defendant in a live television show did not damage the reputation of the plaintiffs is not correct the statements did damage the honour and dignity of the prison officers f. and b. and the professional reputation of remand prison no because they actually contained an accusation that the male prison officers had searched the female lawyer in a degrading manner it can be seen from the statements by the witnesses mr l-vich and mr t. the personal inspection report and the conclusions of the qualifications panel of the moscow city bar that the prison officers did not carry out a search on ms a. contrary to what mr reznik alleged but the district court did not take this fact into account the law distinguishes between the terms ‘ inspection and ‘ search and the defendant mr rezink a professional lawyer could not have been unaware of that distinction although he had at his disposal reliable information that the prison officers had carried out an inspection of ms a. s documents rather than searched her he made untrue statements in a live television show further the city court can not agree with the district court s conclusion that the defendant mr reznik did not identify any of the plaintiffs by name that conclusion contradicted the operative part of the judgment in which the district court found that the incident had taken place on the premises of remand prison no and concerned the removal of a note from ms a the ntv channel showed the building at and the defendant mr reznik later made the contested statements in those circumstances the professional reputation of remand prison no had been undermined and it had standing to seek judicial protection from defamation the plaintiffs f. and b. who were employees of the remand prison and who had taken part in the inspection of ms a. s papers also had standing to sue in defamation. the city court ordered the applicant to pay russian roubles rub to each of mr b. and mr f. in respect of compensation for non-pecuniary damage the ntv channel was ordered to broadcast a rectification article guarantees freedom of thought and expression together with freedom of the mass media article provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of statements that are damaging to his or her honour dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness the aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements a personal inspection личный досмотр or an inspection of personal belongings may be carried out with a view to uncovering instruments or objects of an administrative offence article of the

statement according to which he had incited people to racist agitation rassistische hetze and any similar statements he further requested that the applicant be prohibited from inviting people to send small gifts in response to their racist agitation together with the publication of the names telephone numbers and addresses of members of the plaintiff 's political party the applicant submitted that it had never identified itself with the leaflet at issue and had merely published it out of journalistic interest and in order to inform the public moreover the words racist agitation were not a statement of fact but a value judgment and were meant as a critical comment of the opinion poll austria first which the plaintiff had initiated and which was directed against immigration without control on april the granted the injunction it found that the impugned statement about racist agitation was not a value judgment but a statement of fact such a statement contained a reproach of a criminal offence namely incitement to hatred verhetzung under article of the austrian criminal code strafgesetzbuch and not only damaged the plaintiff 's reputation rufschädigung but also amounted to an insult ehrenbeleidigung in order to avoid the injunction the applicant therefore needed to prove the truth of its statement however it had failed to do so even accepting that the plaintiff was more or less a right-wing politician there was no evidence that he had attempted to incite hatred verhetzen against aliens or had attacked their human dignity as regards the invitation to send small gifts the court observed that a part of the applicant 's readership was for political reasons prepared to use violence and anarchistic methods in this respect the court noted that in the december issue of tatblatt a letter to the editor had been published which read as follows we organised in the night of to november our first action against haider 's referendum and have smashed several windows of the fpö headquarters in this was only the beginning according to another letter to the editor published in the january issue of tatblatt an fpö party office in had been visited the words racism stinks had been sprayed on the walls windows smashed and butter acid thrown into the office the then quoted further letters of this kind which had appeared in various issues of tatblatt the court found that against this background the invitation to send small gifts constituted an attack on the plaintiff 's personality rights persönlichkeitsrechte which had to be respected accordingly the court granted the injunction in this respect also on august the applicant appealed against the injunction on january the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht dismissed the appeal it confirmed the 's view that the statement according to which the plaintiff had incited people to racist agitation was a statement of fact which the applicant had failed to prove in this respect the court found as follows but since as we have already outlined in dealing with the complaint concerning the facts the meaning of the term 'racist agitation could be established on the basis of general experience and since the defendant has failed to submit any concrete allegations to the effect that the plaintiff had shown conduct corresponding to what is generally known as 'racism and 'agitation the court of first instance without there being a mistake of law rightly concluded that the defendant was unable to prove the truth of its allegations as regards the applicant 's argument that this statement was covered by its right to freedom of expression the court of appeal found that the interests of the applicant and the plaintiff had to be balanced against each other however the applicant 's statement could not be justified by referring to freedom of expression because the statement went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism by reproaching the plaintiff with a criminal offence moreover the impugned statement was untrue and therefore not protected by article of the convention the court of appeal confirmed the decision of the in respect of both statements on march the applicant introduced an extraordinary appeal on points of law außerordentliche revision against the court of appeal 's decision in so far as it concerned the prohibition to repeat the statement that the plaintiff had incited people to racist agitation on april the supreme court oberster gerichtshof declared the extraordinary appeal inadmissible as it found that the qualification of the statement at issue as a statement of fact was in accordance with its previous case-law article of the austrian civil code allgemeines bürgerliches gesetzbuch provides as follows everyone who has suffered material damage or loss of profit because of an insult may claim compensation the same applies if anyone disseminates statements of fact which jeopardise another person 's credit gain or livelihood and if the untruth of the statement

the case originated in an application no against the french republic lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a french national ms anne-marie couderc and hachette filipacchi associés a company incorporated in france the applicants on august the applicants were represented by ms m.-c. de percin of the paris bar the french government the government were represented by their agent ms edwige belliard director of legal affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs the applicants alleged that there had been an unjustified breach of their freedom of expression on march the application was communicated to the government the applicants are the publication director and the publisher respectively of the weekly magazine paris match ms anne-marie couderc is a french national and was born in the company hachette filipacchi associés a legal entity incorporated under french law has its registered office in levallois-perret on may the british newspaper the daily mail published claims by ms c. alleging that albert grimaldi reigning prince of monaco since his father s death on april was the father of her son the article referred to the forthcoming report in the paris match magazine and reproduced the main points of that report together with three photographs one of which showed the prince holding the child in his arms on may having been informed that an article was about to appear in paris match prince albert served notice on the applicants to refrain from publishing the article in question in spite of the notice to refrain the weekly magazine paris match in its edition no of may copies of which were printed published an interview in which ms c. presented her son a. as having been born from her intimate relationship with the prince who had succeeded his father on the previous april publicised on the magazine s cover under the headline albert of monaco a. the secret child albert de monaco a. l enfant secret the ten-page article entitled a is albert s son says his mother included several photographs showing the prince beside ms c. or the child those of the prince and the child had been taken by ms c. with the prince s consent ms c. who had sole parental authority had handed them over to paris match for publication the article in which ms c. replied to the questions put by a journalist gave details about the circumstances in which she had met the prince their meetings their intimate relationship and feelings the way in which the prince had reacted to the news of ms c. s pregnancy and how he had behaved on meeting the child it noted that the boy had been born on august and that the prince had formally recognised him before a notary on december but had requested that this fact should not be made public before the death of his own father prince rainier iii on may the prince brought proceedings against the applicants in the nanterre tribunal de grande instance on the basis of article of the convention and articles and of the civil code seeking compensation for invasion of privacy and infringement of his right to protection of his image through the publication of the above-mentioned article on may on june the court allowed the prince s claim awarding him euros in damages and ordering that details of the judgment be printed in a full-page feature on the magazine s front page on pain of a daily fine and at the publisher s expense under the headline court order made against paris match at the request of prince albert ii of monaco the judgment was immediately enforceable in allowing the prince s claims the court noted in particular that from the first page onwards the magazine disclosed the prince s paternity through the headline albert of monaco a. the secret child accompanied by a photograph showing him holding the child it added that the ten-page article dealt with the issue of the prince s father-son relationship with the child by means of questions which led the child s mother to discuss her relationship with the prince the feelings of those involved the prince s private life and reactions and the child s recognition child before a notary it added that numerous photographs clearly taken in the context of the intimacy of the protagonists private life had been deliberately chosen to illustrate and lend support to the disclosure they were accompanied by the magazine s own captions which also referred to the prince s emotional life analysing his conduct his reactions to the young woman and the child and speculating as to his feelings with regard to this secret child the court considered that the entire article and the accompanying pictures came within the most intimate sphere of emotional and family life and that they were not apt to be the subject of any debate of general interest it added that the claimant s accession to the throne of the principality of monaco did not deprive him of the right to respect for his private life nor of his right to protection of his own image in the face of mere rumours concerning the civil status of a child which could not serve as a legitimate pretext for providing information to a prying and curious public about the lives of public figures their feelings and their private conduct in addition the court held that a newspaper could not seriously claim to take the place of the courtroom where the rights of children and women were lawfully defended the court concluded that the impugned article which treated rumours in a sensational manner both in its wording and through the completely irrelevant accompanying pictures amounted to a serious breach of the claimant s fundamental personality rights the latter having specifically served notice by a bailiff on the publishing company to respect those rights on may the applicants appealed against that judgment and obtained a suspension of the judgment s immediate enforceability on july the prince issued a statement in which he publicly recognised the child the notarised document was entered in the register of births deaths and marriages during the same period on november the versailles court of appeal gave judgment it noted that through the interview with the child s mother the impugned article focused on revealing the birth of the child who was presented as having been born from the intimate relationship she had conducted with the prince since furthermore on the date of the article s publication both his birth and his father s identity were unknown to the public the court of appeal emphasised that emotional love or family life and issues of paternity and maternity came within the sphere of private life and were protected by article of the civil code and article of the convention which according to the court made no distinction between anonymous persons and public figures whatever their civil political or religious functions it noted that the fact of the prince s fatherhood had never been publicly recognised that the monegasque constitution made it impossible for a child born outside wedlock to accede to the throne and that the prince had not given his consent to the disclosure of his possible paternity of the child having on may indicated to the applicant company his opposition to the publication of those facts in consequence it concluded that the applicant company had deliberately breached the provisions of article of the civil code and of article of the convention it considered that this offence could not be justified by the requirements of current affairs reporting the legitimacy of the information or readers right to information which did not cover the prince s secret paternity even if he had become the reigning prince of the principality since his father s death in april the court of appeal further noted that the article did not merely disclose the existence of a secret child it also contained numerous digressions derived from the confessions made by the child s mother concerning the circumstances of their meeting the prince s feelings his most intimate reactions in response to the news of the pregnancy and his attitude towards the child during private encounters it considered that this could not be justified by the concomitant publication of these facts in a german magazine or by the media impact caused by the content of the article or by the fact that other publications had subsequently repeated these reports which had become common knowledge through the fault of the publishing company or by the alleged legitimacy of such a disclosure the child had no official status which would have rendered his birth and the disclosure of the father s identify a subject which the media as part of their duty to provide information were required to bring to the public s attention it found that although the photographs which accompanied the article and showed the respondent with the child had been taken by the latter s mother and with the prince s consent he had not consented to their publication and that consequently she was at fault the court of appeal concluded that the publication in question had caused the prince irreversible damage in that the fact that he was the child s father which he had wished to keep secret and which had remained so from the child s birth until publication of the impugned article had suddenly become public knowledge against his wishes the non-pecuniary damage thus caused justified the issuing of an order for publication as supplementary compensation which in view of the nature of the breach and the seriousness of its consequences was in no way disproportionate to the competing interests and on the contrary represented the most adequate redress in such circumstances the versailles court of appeal upheld the contested judgement in particular the payment of euros in damages and merely varied the conditions of the order for publication which was no longer to appear under a headline and occupy one third of the front cover thus the court ordered that in the first issue to be published in the week following service of the judgment a box covering the lower third of the front page and containing the following text was to be printed on a white background failing which the applicant company would be fined euros per issue by a judgment of the versailles court of appeal upholding the judgment delivered by the nanterre tribunal de grande instance the company hachette filipacchi associés in issue no dated may of the newspaper paris match in an article entitled ‘ albert of monaco a the secret child has been found to have invaded the privacy and infringed the right to his own image of albert ii of monaco. this statement was published on the front cover of edition no of the magazine dated january under the following editorial commentary albert of monaco the truth is condemned paris match disclosed the existence of his son a the courts have penalised freedom to impart information the international press reacts to support us. the applicants appealed on points of law in their further pleadings they relied in particular on article of the convention given that the disclosure of the prince s paternity was a matter of public life and was justified by the requirements of imparting information in view of the functions that he occupied as sovereign of a principality with a hereditary monarchy by a judgment of february the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on the grounds inter alia that every person whatever his rank birth property or present or future functions is entitled to respect for his private life the judgment notes on the one hand that on the date on which the article was published the child s existence and his family relationship were unknown to the public and that on the other the principality s constitution rules out the possibility of his accession to the throne since he was born outside wedlock a situation that moreover the company did not allege to be a subject of debate in french or monegasque society or of examination in the impugned publication and lastly that the article contained multiple digressions on the circumstances in which ms c. and prince albert met and about their relationship the prince s reactions to the news of the pregnancy and his subsequent attitude towards the child in the light of these findings and considerations the court of appeal correctly noted the lack of any topical news item or any debate on a matter of general interest which justified its being reported at the time of the impugned publication on the grounds of legitimate imparting of information to the public moreover the publication of photographs of a person to illustrate subsequent content which amounted to an invasion of his privacy necessarily infringes his right to control of one s own image. the interview with ms c. and the disputed photographs were also published in the german weekly magazine bunte of may having brought urgent proceedings against this magazine in order to prevent any further publication the prince s case was dismissed on july by a judgment of the freiburg regional court landgericht upheld on november by the karlsruhe court of appeal oberlandesgericht the german courts placed the public s right to information over the prince s interests in protection of his private life having regard to his status as sovereign of a european principality they described him as an undeniable figure of contemporary society and considered that the issue of a male descendent was of decisive importance in a constitutional hereditary monarchy given that a change to the rule prohibiting a child born out of wedlock from claiming the monegasque throne could not be ruled out in the future they considered that it was for the child s mother and not for the prince who had not recognised him to decide whether the disclosure of the child s existence fell within the protected private sphere however the karlsruhe court of appeal ordered that a photograph showing the prince in ms c. s company was not to be published the civil code the relevant provisions of the civil code provide as follows article everyone has the right to respect for his private life judges may without prejudice to a right to compensation for the damage sustained order any measures such as seizure attachment and others that may prevent or cause to cease an interference with the intimate side of private life in the event of urgency such measures may be ordered on an interlocutory application. article any act that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it. the relevant passages of resolution adopted by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on june read as follows the assembly recalls the current affairs debate it held on the right to privacy during its september session a few weeks after the accident which cost the princess of wales her life on that occasion some people called for the protection of privacy and in particular that of public figures to be reinforced at the european level by means of a convention while others believed that privacy was sufficiently protected by national legislation and the european convention on human rights and that freedom of expression should not be jeopardised in order to explore the matter further the committee on legal affairs and human rights organised a hearing in paris on december with the participation of public figures or their representatives and the media the right to privacy guaranteed by article of the european convention on human rights has already been defined by the assembly in the declaration on mass communication media and human rights contained within resolution as ‘ the right to live one s own life with a minimum of interference in view of the new communication technologies which make it possible to store and use personal data the right to control one s own data should be added to this definition the assembly is aware that personal privacy is often invaded even in countries with specific legislation to protect it as people s private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media the victims are essentially public figures since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales at the same time public figures must recognise that the position they occupy in society in many cases by choice automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy public figures are persons holding public office and/or using public resources and more broadly speaking all those who play a role in public life whether in politics the economy the arts the social sphere sport or in any other domain it is often in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right to freedom of expression which is guaranteed in article of the european convention on human rights that the media invade people s privacy claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures certain facts relating to the private lives of public figures particularly politicians may indeed be of interest to citizens and it may therefore be legitimate for readers who are also voters to be informed of those facts it is therefore necessary to find a way of balancing the exercise of two fundamental rights both of which are guaranteed in the european convention on human rights the right to respect for one s private life and the right to freedom of expression the assembly reaffirms the importance of every person s right to privacy and of the right to freedom of expression as fundamental to a democratic society these rights are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order since they are of equal value however the assembly points out that the right to privacy afforded by article of the european convention on human rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities but also against interference by private persons or institutions including the mass media the assembly believes that since all member states have now ratified the european convention on human rights and since many systems of national legislation comprise provisions guaranteeing this protection there is no need to propose that a new convention guaranteeing the right to privacy should be adopted,case originated application french republic lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr igor gennadyevich kabanov the applicant on february the russian government the government were initially represented by ms v. milinchuk former representative of the russian federation at the european court of human rights mr a. savenkov first deputy minister of justice of the russian federation and subsequently by mr g. matyushkin representative of the russian federation at the european court of human rights the applicant alleged in particular that his disbarment had amounted to an infringement of his right to freedom of expression and that the domestic court which had considered his case on appeal had not been impartial on april the president of the first section decided to give notice of the application to the government under the provisions of former article of the convention the court decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility the government objected to the joint examination of the admissibility and merits of the application having examined the government 's objection the court dismissed it the applicant was born in and lives in the applicant an advocate at the time acted as defence counsel for a mr r. on august the primorskiy district court of arkhangelsk chaired by judge v. removed the applicant from his position as mr r. 's counsel the district court found that the applicant had acted contrary to the code of criminal procedure and the advocate 's code of ethics the court noted in particular persistent and repeated voluntary statements made by the applicant that he provided legal advice to witnesses n. and s. and at the same time acted as counsel for defendant r. show that the applicant in violation of the formal requirements of the russian code of criminal procedure provided legal advice and acted as counsel in respect of persons whose interests were in conflict therefore it is not possible for the applicant to continue to participate in the trial as legal counsel for defendant r. or to provide legal advice to n. and s. on september the district court found mr r. guilty as charged on december the quashed mr r. 's conviction and remitted the matter for fresh consideration the court also upheld on appeal the decision of august on december the applicant asked the presidium of the for supervisory review of the judicial decisions to remove him from being mr r. 's representative on february judge a. of the dismissed the above complaint in particular the judge noted as follows i hereby return your complaint against the decisions of august and december without having considered it on the merits the reason for this is that the primorskiy district court of the arkhangelsk region opened r. 's trial on january and it is impossible to verify the lawfulness and inconsistency of the decisions in question. on february the applicant filed a complaint against the judges who had participated in the proceedings for the determination of the criminal charge against mr r. alleging that they had acted in violation of the rules of criminal procedure by refusing to consider his application for supervisory review in respect of the decision of august the complaint was addressed to the president of the supreme court of the with a copy to the president of the the applicant asked for the president 's intervention which would prompt in his opinion the to respond to his application for supervisory review in particular the applicant made the following comments in the complaint judges a. and v. used to plough the fields of justice together at the arkhangelsk regional prosecutor 's office and apparently they continue their joint efforts now at the in my opinion either judge a. is not quite familiar with the law which is sad or judge a. wilfully and knowingly restricts my access to court which is twice as sad on february i received an absolutely unlawful brush-off reply from judge a judge a could have unglued his posterior from his seat and brought it to the premises of the primorskiy district court otherwise why would judge a. receive such a salary which i as a tax payer contribute to but judge a. simply pushed away my request for supervisory review and by doing so he seriously violated the rules of criminal procedure and my constitutional rights i believe that one telephone call from the supreme court of the will be enough to make the consider my complaint on the merits the president of the supreme court forwarded the applicant 's complaint to the for further action the president of the lodged a complaint with the council of the arkhangelsk region bar association the council alleging that the above comments were offensive and incompatible with the advocate 's code of professional conduct he stated as follows in our opinion the applicant 's complaint contains remarks which are offensive and tactless vis-à-vis certain judges of the we believe that the content and the style of the complaint are impermissible in our view the reference made by the applicant in his complaint addressed to the president of the supreme court of russia that a decision could be made in response to his application for supervisory review through a telephone call shows that he is lacking the qualities appropriate to his profession a dvocates should under any circumstances be tactful and correct vis-à-vis their counterparts and public officers including judges they should demonstrate respect towards the court and challenge judicial acts correctly and in accordance with the law having regard to the above i hereby request that you follow up on the applicant 's conduct and inform the arkhangelsk regional court of the measures taken. on april the council held a disciplinary hearing the applicant did not challenge the offensive character of the comments he submitted that he had been in a way provoked by the judges allegedly unlawful decisions the council granted the complaint and terminated the applicant 's bar membership as of april in particular the council noted as follows the applicant 's complaint addressed to the president of the supreme court of russia contains tactless remarks in respect of certain judges of the arkhangelsk regional court which amounts to a violation of the advocate 's code of professional conduct the content and the style of the applicant 's complaint addressed to the president of the supreme court of russia are impermissible the reference made by the applicant in his complaint addressed to the president of the supreme court of russia that a decision could be made in response to his application for supervisory review through a telephone call shows that he is lacking the qualities appropriate to his profession a dvocates should under any circumstances be tactful and correct vis-à-vis judges they should demonstrate respect towards the court and challenge judicial acts correctly and in accordance with the law. the applicant appealed to the court he claimed that he was disliked by the members of the council and their decision had been retaliation against him for his personal views and convictions he also alleged that the disciplinary hearing had been carried out with certain procedural irregularities on june the oktyabrskiy district court of arkhangelsk dismissed the claim brought by the applicant against the bar association seeking reinstatement of his membership the applicant appealed on august the applicant asked the to transfer the case to another jurisdiction for consideration the applicant alleged that any judge of the would be biased against him because the original complaint which had prompted the disciplinary proceedings against him had been lodged by the president of the said court on the same day judge m. of the refused to consider the applicant 's request and returned the relevant documents to him in particular the judge informed the applicant as follows i hereby return your application stating the challenge to the whole composition of the and advise you that pursuant to the rules of civil procedure it is only possible to challenge the specific judges who are appointed to consider your case and not the whole composition of the court on august the upheld the judgment of june on appeal the court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant 's allegations of the council 's partiality nor did it discern any procedural irregularities in the applicant 's disbarment the advocate 's code of professional conduct article establishes that an advocate may be subject to disciplinary proceedings for a failure to abide by legislation concerning advocates activities and advocacy and for failure to abide by the code itself any impropriety discrediting an advocate 's professional integrity or the legal profession a breach of the care of duty vis-à-vis his or her client or a failure to abide by the decisions of the qualifications committee and council of the advocates chamber gives rise to disciplinary liability article the disciplinary sanctions available are reprimand warning disbarment or other sanctions as determined by the conference of the advocates chamber article the judges status act stipulates in section that in addition to the performance of judicial functions the president of a court organises the work of the court determines the court 's internal regulations on the basis of the model regulations adopted by the council of the judges of the and supervises compliance therewith distributes the workload between the deputy presidents and judges organises the judges training carries out the general management of the court 's office as follows hires and dismisses the court 's employees distributes the workload between them decides on their performance awards and disciplinary liability organises training for the court 's employees informs on a regular basis the judges and the court 's employees of his or her activities and the activities of the court and performs other functions pertaining to the organisation of the court 's work. the russian code of civil procedure article provides that should a challenge against a judge or panel of the judges be granted the matter should be transferred to another judge or judicial panel within the same if the challenge to a judge or a judicial panel is granted and it is no longer possible to form a new judicial panel to consider the case it should be transferred to the supreme court of russia which will reassign it to another court the court should transfer the case to another court if following a challenge to one or several judges or due to other reasons it can not consider the case the transfer of the case is carried out by the relevant superior court article of the russian code of civil procedure pursuant to decision no of the supreme court of russia of april the supreme court of russia granted a request lodged by the to transfer a case concerning a defamation action lodged by a judge of the the case was transferred to the in particular the supreme court of russia noted as follows i n these circumstances the matter can not be considered in accordance with the rules of jurisdiction due to objective reasons given that the action was lodged by k.i.v. a judge of the chita regional court that court upheld the challenge to the whole panel of the chita regional court and pursuant to article of the russian code of civil procedure forwarded the case to the supreme court of russia for determination of its jurisdiction the constitutional court of russia has noted in its ruling of march that under certain circumstances for example if a civil action is lodged against a judge or by a judge of the same court and if the court which has jurisdiction over the matter does not function for one reason or another the change of the jurisdiction of the matter is not only possible but is sometimes necessary pursuant to article of the russian code of civil procedure the court transfers the case to another court if following the challenge to one or several judges or due to other reasons the replacement of

the case originated in an application no against the republic of azerbaijan lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by an azerbaijani national mr eynulla emin oglu fatullayev eynulla emin oğlu fətullayev the applicant on september the applicant was represented by mr i. ashurov a lawyer practising in the azerbaijani government the government were represented by their agent mr ç. asgarov the applicant alleged in particular that his criminal convictions for statements made in newspaper articles authored by him had constituted a violation of his freedom of expression that he had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law and that his right to the presumption of innocence had not been respected on september the president of the first section decided to give notice of the application to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article of the convention mr k. hajiyev the judge elected in respect of withdrew from sitting in the chamber rule of the rules of court the government accordingly appointed mr l. hüseynov to sit as an ad hoc judge in his place article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in the applicant was the founder and chief editor of the newspapers gündəlik azərbaycan published in the azerbaijani language and realny azerbaijan реальный азербайджан published in the russian language the newspapers were widely known for often publishing articles harshly criticising the government and various public officials prior to the events complained of in this application the applicant had been sued for defamation in a number of sets of civil and criminal proceedings instituted following complaints by various high-ranking government officials including cabinet ministers and members of parliament in the most recent set of proceedings on september the applicant was convicted of defamation of a cabinet minister and conditionally sentenced to two years imprisonment moreover according to the applicant at various times he and his staff had received numerous threatening phone calls demanding him to stop writing critical articles about high-ranking officials or even to completely cease the publication of his newspapers in two sets of criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant in connection with inter alia two articles published by him in realny azerbaijan in the applicant visited as a journalist the area of nagornokarabakh and other territories controlled by the armenian military forces this was one of a few exceptionally allowed and organised visits by azerbaijani nationals to those territories and to in the years following the nagorno-karabakh war as movement across the front line in nagorno-karabakh and across the armenian-azerbaijani border remains severely restricted to this day from both sides during his visit he met among others some officials of the self-proclaimed unrecognised and some ordinary people in the aftermath of this visit in april the applicant published an article called the karabakh diary russian карабахский дневник in realny azerbaijan in the article styled as a diary the applicant described his visits to several towns including lachin shusha agdam and khojaly which had formerly been inhabited primarily by ethnic azerbaijanis who had been forced to flee their homes during the war he described both the ruins of war and the new construction sites that he had seen in those towns as well as his casual conversations with a number of local armenians he had met during his visit one of the topics discussed in the karabakh diary concerned the khojaly massacre of february discussing this topic the applicant made certain statements which could be construed as differing from the commonly accepted version of the khojaly events according to which hundreds of azerbaijani civilians had been killed by the armenian armed forces with the reported assistance of the russian formerly soviet motorised rifle regiment during their assault on the town of khojaly in the course of the war in nagorno-karabakh specifically the article contained the following passages having seen khojaly i could not hide my astonishment this azerbaijani town which had been razed to the ground has been completely reconstructed and converted into a town called ivanovka named after an armenian general who had actively participated in the occupation of khojaly the khojaly tragedy and the deep wounds inflicted on our soul by the armenian expansionism on this long-suffering azerbaijani land permeated all my meetings in askeran a town in nagorno-karabakh close to khojaly how so can it be true that nothing human is left in these people however for the sake of fairness i will admit that several years ago i met some refugees from khojaly temporarily settled in naftalan who openly confessed to me that on the eve of the large-scale offensive of the russian and armenian troops on khojaly the town had been encircled by those troops and even several days prior to the attack the armenians had been continuously warning the population about the planned operation through loudspeakers and suggesting that the civilians abandon the town and escape from the encirclement through a humanitarian corridor along the according to the khojaly refugees own words they had used this corridor and indeed the armenian soldiers positioned behind the corridor had not opened fire on them some soldiers from the battalions of the nfa the national front of azerbaijan a political party for some reason had led part of the refugees in the direction of the which during that period had been under the control of the armenians askeran battalion the other group of refugees were hit by artillery volleys while they were reaching the agdam region when i was in askeran i spoke to the deputy head of the administration of askeran slavik arushanyan and compared his recollection of the events with that of the khojaly inhabitants who came under fire from the azerbaijani side i asked s. arushanyan to show me the corridor which the khojaly inhabitants had used to abandon the town having familiarised myself with the geographical area i can say fully convinced that the conjectures that there had been no armenian corridor are groundless the corridor did indeed exist otherwise the khojaly inhabitants fully surrounded by the enemy troops and isolated from the outside world would not have been able to force their way out and escape the encirclement however having crossed the area behind the the row of refugees was separated and for some reason a group of them headed in the direction of nakhichevanik it appears that the nfa battalions were striving not for the liberation of the khojaly civilians but for more bloodshed on their way to overthrow a. mutalibov the first president of azerbaijan more than a year after the publication of the above article during the period from december to january a person registered under the username eynulla fatullayev identifying himself as the applicant made a number of postings on the publicly accessible internet forum of a website called azeritricolor the postings were made in a specific forum thread dedicated to other forum members questions to the forum member named eynulla fatullayev about the contents of the karabakh diary in his various answers to those questions the person posting under the username eynulla fatullayev made inter alia the following statements i have visited this town naftalan where i have spoken to hundreds i repeat hundreds of refugees who insisted that there had been a corridor and that they had remained alive owing to this corridor you see it was wartime and there was a front line of course armenians were killing the civilians but part of the khojaly inhabitants had been fired upon by our own troops whether it was done intentionally or not is to be determined by investigators they were killed not by some mysterious shooters but by provocateurs from the nfa battalions the corpses had been mutilated by our own on february ms t. chaladze the head of the centre for protection of refugees and displaced persons brought a civil action against the applicant in the yasamal district court she claimed that the applicant had for a long period of time insulted the honour and dignity of the victims of the khojaly tragedy persons killed during those tragic events and their relatives as well as veterans of the karabakh war soldiers of the azerbaijani national army and the entire azerbaijani people she alleged that the applicant had done so by making the above-mentioned statements in his article the karabakh diary as well as by making similar insulting statements on the forum of the azeritricolor website ms chaladze attributed the authorship of the internet forum postings made from the forum account with the username eynulla fatullayev to the applicant in his submissions to the court the applicant argued that the forum postings at the azeritricolor website had not been written by him and denied making these statements he also argued that in the karabakh diary he had merely reported the information given to him by persons whom he had interviewed the yasamal district court sitting as a single-judge formation composed of judge i. ismayilov heard evidence from a number of refugees from khojaly all of whom testified about their escape from the town and noted that they had not been fired upon by azerbaijani soldiers and that the applicant 's assertions concerning this were false furthermore having examined electronic evidence and witness statements the court established that the postings on the azeritricolor forum had indeed been made by the applicant himself and that they had been posted in response to various questions by readers of realny azerbaijan the court found that the applicant and the newspaper had disseminated false and unproven statements tarnishing the honour and dignity of the survivors of the khojaly events in view of the above findings on april the yasamal district court upheld ms chaladze 's claim and ordered the applicant to publish in realny azerbaijan and on related websites a retraction of his statements and an apology to the refugees from khojaly and the newspaper 's readers the court also ordered the applicant and realny azerbaijan to pay new azerbaijani manats azn approximately euros each in respect of non-pecuniary damage this total award of azn was to be spent on upgrading the living conditions of the refugees from khojaly temporarily residing in naftalan thereafter on an unspecified date a group of four khojaly survivors and two former soldiers who had been involved in the khojaly battle represented by ms chaladze lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant with the yasamal district court under the private prosecution procedure they asked that the applicant be convicted of defamation and of falsely accusing azerbaijani soldiers of having committed an especially grave crime at a preliminary hearing held on april the applicant filed an objection against the entire judicial composition of the yasamal district court he claimed that all of the judges of that court had been appointed to their positions in september for a fixed five-year term and that their term of office had expired in he therefore argued that the composition of the court meant that it could not be regarded as a tribunal established by law this objection was dismissed the hearing of the criminal case took place on april and was presided over by judge i. ismayilov sitting as a single judge in his oral submissions to the court the applicant pleaded his innocence in particular he denied making the statements on the forum of the azeritricolor website and maintained that those statements had been made by some unknown impostor who had used his name for this purpose the court heard a linguistic expert who gave an opinion on the applicant 's statements the expert testified inter alia that owing to the specific style in which the karabakh diary had been written it was difficult to differentiate whether the specific statements and conclusions made concerning the khojaly events could be attributable to the applicant personally or to those persons whom he had allegedly interviewed in nagorno-karabakh he also noted that it was difficult to analyse separately the specific phrases taken out of the context of the article as a whole and that it appeared from the context that the author had attempted to convey the positions of both sides to the conflict the court also heard several witnesses who testified about the khojaly events and stated that there had been no escape corridor for the civilians and that the civilians had been shot at from the enemy 's positions the court further found that the internet forum of the azeritricolor website in essence had replaced the internet forum of the realny azerbaijan website which had become defunct in and that the statements posted on that forum under the username eynulla fatullayev had indeed been made by the applicant himself lastly the court found that through his statements made in the karabakh diary and his internet forum postings the applicant had given a heavily distorted account of the historical events in khojaly and had deliberately disseminated false information which had damaged the reputation of the plaintiffs and had accused the soldiers of the azerbaijani army specifically the two plaintiffs who had fought in khojaly of committing grave crimes which they had not committed the court convicted the applicant under articles defamation and defamation by accusing a person of having committed a grave crime of the criminal code and sentenced him to two years and six months imprisonment the applicant was arrested in the courtroom and taken to detention facility no on the same day april on june the court of appeal upheld the yasamal district court 's judgment of april on august the supreme court dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicant and upheld the lower courts judgments in the meantime on march realny azerbaijan had published an article entitled the aliyevs go to war russian алиевы идут на войну the article was written by the applicant but published under the pseudonym rovshan bagirov this analytical article was devoted to the possible consequences of azerbaijan 's support for a recent anti-iranian resolution of the united nations un security council which had called for economic sanctions against that country the article referred to the current azerbaijani government as the aliyev clan and the governing family and expressed the view that the government had sought united states us support for president ilham aliyev 's remaining in power in azerbaijan in exchange for azerbaijan 's support for the us aggression against iran the article continued as follows it is also known that immediately after the un security council had voted for this resolution the authorities in began to seriously prepare for the beginning of the 'anti-iranian operation for several years the military headquarters of the islamic regime had been developing plans for repulsing the american aggression and counter-attacking the and their allies in the region after march having openly supported the anti-iranian operation must prepare for a lengthy and dreadful war which will result in large-scale destruction and loss of human life according to information from sources close to official paris the iranian general staff has already developed its military plans concerning azerbaijan in the event that baku takes part in the aggression against thus the iranian long-range military air force thousands of insane kamikaze terrorists from the irgc the islamic revolution 's guardian corps and hundreds of and missiles will strike the following main targets on the the article continued with a long and detailed list of such targets which included inter alia active petroleum platforms on the shelf of the caspian sea the sangachal oil terminal and other petroleum plants and terminals the bakutbilisiceyhan petroleum pipeline and the bakutbilisi-erzurum gas pipeline the building of the presidential administration the building of the us embassy in azerbaijan buildings of various ministries the baku seaport and airport and a number of large business centres housing the offices of major foreign companies doing business in azerbaijan further it was noted in the article that the azerbaijani government should have maintained neutrality in its relations with both the us and iran and that its support of the us position could lead in the event of a war between those two states to such grave consequences as loss of human life among azeris in both azerbaijan and iran in this connection the author noted that the us military forces were already operating four airbases on the territory of azerbaijan and had expressed an interest in operating the gabala radar station which was then operated by the article also discussed the issue of possible unrest in the event of a conflict with iran in the southern regions of populated by the talysh ethnic minority who are ethnically and linguistically close to the persians among other things the article appeared to imply that the current ruling elite a large number of whom allegedly came from the region of nakhchivan was engaging in regional nepotism by appointing people from nakhchivan to government posts in southern areas of the country including the lenkoran region in particular the article stated thus the talysh have long been expressing their discontent with the fact that the central authorities always appoint to administrative positions in lenkoran persons hailing from nakhchivan who are alien to the mentality and problems of the region the level of unemployment in the region is terribly high drug abuse is flourishing every morning hundreds of unemployed talysh cluster together at the 'slave that is cheap labour market in is this not a powder keg but the authorities seemingly unaware of the danger of the developing situation are giving preference to their standard methods repressive measures and paying off the talysh elite it seems as if the authorities are deliberately pushing the talysh into the embrace of iranian radicals. the article noted that certain high-ranking iranian officials and ayatollahs were of talysh ethnicity and that there were several million talysh living across the iranian border who could support their kin living in in the event of a war lastly the article concluded that the azerbaijani authorities did not realise all the dangerous consequences of the geopolitical game they were playing on may the investigation department of the ministry of national security the mns commenced a criminal investigation in connection with the publication of the article under article of the criminal code terrorism or threat of terrorism on may the investigation authorities conducted searches in the applicant 's flat and in the office of the realny azerbaijan and gündəlik azərbaycan newspapers they found and seized certain

courts and taking disciplinary measures against judges the following are extracts from resolution of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on the functioning of democratic institutions in as regards freedom of expression the azerbaijani authorities should initiate the legal reform aimed at decriminalising defamation and revise the relevant civil law provisions to ensure respect for the principle of proportionality as recommended in resolution in the meantime a political moratorium should be reintroduced so as to put an end to the use of defamation lawsuits as a means of intimidating journalists the following are extracts from the report by the council of europe commissioner for human rights mr thomas hammarberg on his visit to azerbaijan from to september commdh february b a matter of urgency the decriminalisation of defamation at the time of the commissioner 's visit it was reported that there were seven journalists in prison out of whom four were for libel or defamation under articles and of the criminal code both international monitoring bodies and local ngos claimed that charging individuals for defamation was used as a means to avoid the dissemination of news that could be detrimental to high-ranking officials or to other influential people according to the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe rapporteurs the number of charges has grown in the last few years out of fear of imprisonment journalists are compelled to resort to self-censorship in the president mr ilham aliyev had called for abandoning the use of criminal provisions in matters of defamation but this was not respected some cases which the commissioner was informed about point to abusive or unfair imprisonment of journalists indeed many journalists remain incarcerated mr eynulla fatullayev who was held at the pre-trial detention centres on the premises of the ministry for national security is still incarcerated this journalist had criticised the authorities and armed forces conduct during the siege of khojaly his critical analysis of the handling of the crisis cost him a two and half year sentence for libel furthermore in a concerning stacking of incriminations he was sentenced on october to an additional eight and a half years this time on charges of terrorism and incitement to racial hatred when this journalist met the commissioner he said that the fact that he had been jailed was evidence of political pressure on him as a journalist after the decision on this second sentence he reiterated this comment the commissioner mentioned his imprisonment for libel to the authorities and called for his immediate release the commissioner once again urges the authorities to release mr eynulla fatullayev the authorities response to questions regarding this issue is that actions against journalists are caused by their lack of professionalism which leads them to writing in a non-responsible manner and ignoring their legal and ethical duties there should indeed be proper training and education of journalists who have a responsibility in the exercise of their profession and should follow a code of ethics in line with european standards at the same time officials should allow easy access to information and accept criticism inherent to their position of accountability in society nevertheless the fundamental issue here is whether people in particular but not only journalists should be deprived of liberty and other criminal law consequences on account of views expressed the supplementary issue as already dealt with is whether where it still exists as an offence under criminal law as it is the case in the prosecution of defamation does not in fact lead to instances of abusive prosecution and/or excessive sentences there is clearly a general trend to move towards a decriminalisation of defamation in europe today international standards allow the penalisation of defamation through criminal law but only in cases of hate speech directly intended at inciting violence to corroborate the requirement of intention there has to be a direct link between the intention and the likeliness of the violence in most countries the criminal route is not used there is a moratorium on such laws the criminalisation of defamation has a chilling effect on freedom of expression the legal framework in provides for a wide range of possibilities for criminalisation notably for 'damage to honour and reputation work on a draft law on defamation has been going on for more than a year involving a working group of parliamentarians and media experts with the support of the osce emphasis would be shifted from criminal law to civil law the commissioner was encouraged by talks he had on this issue with the minister of justice he recommends the launching of an open public debate that would help define a rights-based approach that would remove defamation from the criminal books and offer alternative protection to other rights and interests council of europe experts could provide assistance in that respect in order to support the holding of that debate the president could reiterate his declaration on a moratorium on the use of the criminal provision the commissioner recommends as a first step the release of all those who have been criminally prosecuted under the relevant provisions of the criminal code. most of the facts of the reported massacre of azerbaijani civilians in khojaly are contested by the azerbaijani and armenian sides as for thirdparty sources the following are extracts from reports of international organisations and human-rights ngos concerning these events the background paper prepared by the directorate general of political affairs of the council of europe appended to the report by the parliamentary assembly 's political affairs committee on the conflict over the nagorno-karabakh region dealt with by the osce minsk conference rapporteur mr d. atkinson november doc states in february almost day-to-day four years after the events the ethnic armenian forces attacked the only airport in nagorno-karabakh in khojali to the north of the local capital at the time the population of khojali was the azerbaijani view is that the taking of khojali which left some defenders of the airport dead was followed by unprecedented brutalities against the civilian population in one day reportedly unarmed people were massacred and close to were captured many of them while trying to flee through an alleged humanitarian corridor the armenian side contests this view and the number of casualties the khojali massacre sparked an exodus of azerbaijanis and precipitated a political crisis in five years later in president aliyev issued a decree referring to the tragedy as the 'khojali genocide'. the following are extracts from the human rights watch world report on the former soviet union during the winter of armenian forces went on the offensive forcing almost the entire azerbaijani population of the enclave to flee and committing unconscionable acts of violence against civilians as they fled the most notorious of these attacks occurred on february in the a large column of residents accompanied by a few dozen retreating fighters fled the city as it fell to armenian forces as they approached the border with they came across an armenian military post and were cruelly fired upon at least civilians are known to have been murdered in this incident although azerbaijani officials estimate that about perished armenian forces killed unarmed civilians and soldiers who were hors de combat and looted and sometimes burned homes. the memorial human rights centre based in moscow dispatched its observers to nagorno-karabakh during the war the following are extracts from the report by the memorial human rights centre on mass violations of human rights in connection with the armed capture of the town of khojaly on the night of to february translated from russian as practically all refugees from khojaly claimed military personnel from the regiment took part in the assault on the town according to the information received from the armenian side combat vehicles of the regiment which took part in the assault on the town shelled khojaly but did not actually enter the town as the armenian side asserts the participation of the military personnel from the regiment was not sanctioned by a written order from the regiment 's command part of the population started to leave khojaly soon after the assault began trying to flee in the direction of agdam there were armed people from the town 's garrison among some of the fleeing groups people left in two directions from the eastern side of the town in the north-east direction along the river passing askeran to their left this specific route according to armenian officials was provided as a 'free corridor from the northern side of the town in the north-east direction passing askeran to their right it appears that a smaller number of refugees fled using this route thus the majority of civilians left khojaly while around people stayed in khojaly hiding in their houses and basements as a result of the shelling of the town an unascertained number of civilians were killed on the during the assault the armenian side practically refused to provide information about the number of people who so perished according to the officials of the nkr the self-proclaimed 'nagorno-karabakh republic a 'free corridor was provided for fleeing civilians which began at the eastern side of the town passed along the river and continued to the north-east leading to agdam and passing askeran to its left according to the officials of the nkr and those taking part in the assault the khojaly population was informed about the existence of this 'corridor through loudspeakers mounted on armoured personnel carriers nkr officials also noted that several days prior to the assault leaflets had been dropped on khojaly from helicopters urging the khojaly population to use the 'free corridor however not a single copy of such a leaflet has been provided to memorial 's observers in support of this assertion likewise no traces of such leaflets have been found by memorial 's observers in khojaly when interviewed khojaly refugees said that they had not heard about such leaflets in agdam and memorial 's observers have interviewed persons who had fled khojaly during the assault on the town only one person out of those interviewed said that he had known about the existence of the 'free corridor he had been told about it by a 'military man from the khojaly garrison several days prior to the assault the representatives of the armenian side had on repeated occasions informed the khojaly authorities by radio about the upcoming assault and urged them to immediately evacuate the population from the town the fact that this information had been received by the azerbaijani side and transferred to baku is confirmed by newspapers bakinskiy rabochiy a large column of inhabitants of khojaly rushed out of town along the river route see above there were armed people from the town garrison in some of the groups of refugees these refugees who walked along the 'free corridor were fired upon as a result of which many people were killed those who remained alive dispersed running refugees came across armenian military posts and were fired upon some refugees managed to escape to agdam some mainly women and children the exact number is impossible to determine froze to death while wandering around in mountains some were captured the site of the mass killing of refugees as well as their corpses was filmed on videotape when the azerbaijani units carried out an operation to evacuate the corpses to agdam by helicopter among the corpses filmed on the videotape the majority were those of women and elderly people there were also children among those killed at the same time there were also people in uniform among those killed within four days about corpses were evacuated to agdam a few score of corpses bore signs of mutilation official representatives of the nkr and members of the armenian armed forces explained the death of civilians in the zone of the 'free corridor by the fact that there were armed people fleeing together with the refugees who were firing at armenian outposts thus drawing return fire as well as by an attempted breakthrough by the main azerbaijani forces according to members of the armenian armed forces the azerbaijani forces attempted to battle through from agdam in the direction of the 'free corridor at the moment when the armenian outposts were fighting off this attack the first groups of khojaly refugees approached them from the rear the armed people who were among the refugees began firing at the armenian outposts during the battle one outpost was destroyed but the fighters from another outpost of whose existence the azerbaijanis were unaware opened fire from a close distance at the people coming from khojaly according to testimonies of khojaly refugees including those published in the press the armed people inside the refugee column did exchange gunfire with armenian outposts but on each occasion the fire was opened first from the armenian side,case originated application republic azerbaijan

the government acting through their new agent mr c.-l. popescu at the president s request the applicant and the government each submitted observations on that judgment on may and june respectively subsequently mr l. ferrari bravo substitute judge replaced mrs palm who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case rule b mr ionel dalban was a journalist who ran a local weekly magazine called cronica romaşcană he lived in the town of roman until his death on march on september an article by the applicant headlined roman ias defrauded of tens of millions appeared in issue no of his magazine the article exposed a series of frauds allegedly committed by g.s. the chief executive of a state-owned agricultural company fastrom of roman previously known as the roman ias or state farm citing fraud squad reports as the source of his information the applicant wrote in particular a new fraud of incredible proportions has been discovered within the roman company fastrom s.a. the former state farm the prime suspect being a privileged member of the local communist nomenklatura mr g.s the losses caused by him amount according to fraud squad and other expert estimates to over lei the fraud was committed by entering stock in the inventory of fastrom of roman s central warehouse stock that does not appear anywhere in the inventories of the undertakings under its control it has been established that much of this stock was replaced by goods required by mr g.s and his friends and family or exchanged for cash which was then shared out in fraternal fashion it makes one think of the highwaymen of old who flouted the law both of god and of the land jaf ca-n codru the people of roman are asking how this could have happened perhaps senator r.t. who hitherto has been the state representative on the board of fastrom of roman will give us an explanation he was paid hundreds of thousands of lei every month in that capacity now we know why or to put it another way how he has been protecting the state s interests in an article in issue no of the magazine published on january the applicant wrote a dacia estate car belonging to the fastrom company was ‘ made over to senator r.t. every weekend for a year and a half to take him to and from bacău airport driven by r.m. this practice may have stopped but it has not been forgotten. g.s and r.t. laid an information against the applicant under article of the criminal code on the basis that what he had written was defamatory on june the roman court of first instance judecătoria convicted the applicant of criminal libel giving him a suspended sentence of three months imprisonment and ordering him to pay lei rol to r.t. and g.s. who were claiming damages in the same proceedings further the applicant was banned from practising his profession for an indefinite period the court found that although two criminal investigations had been held into g.s. s conduct the public prosecutor s office had decided on september and december that he had no case to answer in relation to charges of misappropriation of corporate assets or causing harm to the public interest in the course of his duties as a civil servant abuzul în serviciu contra intereselor obşteşti an offence under article of the criminal code with regard to r.t. the court found that between june and july the salary he had received in his capacity as a member of the board of state representatives had been rol not hundreds of thousands of lei it also found that under the senate s standing orders prefects were to place a means of transport and a secretary at the disposal of senators in order to facilitate the performance of their duties and that in a letter ref no the prefect s office in the county of neamţ had requested fastrom of roman to make a car available to the office of the senator for roman the court concluded that the applicant s allegations did not correspond to reality the applicant appealed against this judgment according to him the fraud squad reports on the basis of which g.s had been charged reports by ministry of finance inspectors of and june and december and statements by members of the board of directors of and of the trade union operating within fastrom of roman all contained evidence of illegal accounting operations attributed to the chief executive g.s according to those documents the sums involved amounted to more than rol as regards r.t. the applicant pointed to the fact that the court of first instance had acknowledged in its judgment of june that r.t. had used a car belonging to fastrom of roman he argued that his assertions concerning the salary received by r.t. had not been defamatory despite the admitted error as to its amount in a judgment of december the neamţ county court tribunalul judeţean decided by two votes to one to uphold the judgment of june as regards both the sentence of imprisonment and the compensation order noting that the public prosecutor s office had decided on two occasions not to press charges against g.s. the court found without examining the police reports produced by the applicant in support of his allegations that those allegations did not correspond to reality with regard to senator r.t. the court found that his use of the car had been lawful however the court did set aside the ban on the applicant working as a journalist because of the praiseworthy way in which he had conducted himself during the proceedings the dissenting judge m.c. delivered a minority judgment in which he concluded revealing the truth is a sine qua non if shortcomings are to be eliminated and the interests of society defended those interests take priority over the defence at any price of our reputations as the active conscience of the nation a journalist has both the right and the duty to question institutions and those who run them so as to monitor whether they are working satisfactorily whether they deserve the authority with which they have been vested and whether the prestige which surrounds them is deserved or not no one is infallible and no one can claim to be it appears to me unjust to convict the journalist ionel dalban when all he has done is to fulfil his duty as a journalist in an objective manner with the aim of contributing to creating a healthier moral climate in the town in which he lives and works despite his conviction the applicant continued to publish information concerning the fraud allegedly committed by g.s moreover he did not pay the damages awarded to g.s and r.t. as a result of his revelations the romanian parliament s committee for the investigation of abuses requested the neamţ public prosecutor s office to look into the matter a non-governmental organisation the democratic league for justice also took up the revelations with the result that on july the roman public prosecutor s office opened a new judicial investigation into g.s. s conduct following the applicant s conviction other newspapers including the mass-circulation national daily adevărul published articles about the alleged fraud many newspapers described the applicant s conviction as an attempt to intimidate the press on april the procurator-general applied to the supreme court of justice to have the applicant s conviction at first instance and on appeal quashed on the grounds that the offence of criminal libel had not been made out in a judgment of march the supreme court of justice allowed the application with regard to the applicant s conviction for libelling g.s. it acquitted the applicant on the ground that he had acted in good faith in respect of the libel on r.t. the court quashed the conviction and while holding that the applicant had been rightly convicted decided to discontinue the proceedings in view of his death the relevant provisions of the criminal code are as follows article anyone who makes any statement or allegation in public concerning a particular person which if true would render that person liable to a criminal administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose them to public opprobrium shall be liable to imprisonment for between three months and one year or to a fine. article evidence of the truth of such a statement or allegation is admissible where the statement or allegation was made in order to protect a legitimate interest where the truth of the statement or allegation is proved no offence of insult or defamation will have been committed. the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure read article an appeal shall lie in the following circumstances where the judgment does not deal either with all the charges made against the accused in the committal order with all the evidence taken or with all applications that are of essential importance to a party in that they may safeguard that party s rights or have an effect on the outcome of the trial article anyone who has been finally convicted is entitled to compensation from the state for any loss or damage suffered where it is held in a fresh judgment against which no appeal lies that he did not commit the offence in question or that the offence was not committed … a person who at any time during the investigative or trial stage of the case acting with clear intent and in a gravely culpable manner hindered or sought to hinder the establishment of the truth shall not be entitled to any such compensation any person designated in sub-paragraphs or above who was in employment at the time of his arrest shall be treated for the purposes of all allowances and benefits linked to length or continuity of service as if he had been continuously employed during the period of his imprisonment or penal labour. article proceedings under article for compensation for loss or damage may be brought by any person who has suffered such loss or damage or after his death may be brought or pursued by his dependants such proceedings must be commenced within one year of the date of the final acquittal or order discontinuing the proceedings. mr dalban applied to the commission on april relying on articles and of the convention he complained that he had not been given a fair trial and that his right to freedom of expression had been infringed the commission declared the application no admissible on september in its report of january former article of the convention it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of article unanimously and that it was not necessary to examine whether there had also been a violation of article thirty-one votes to one the full text of the commission s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment mrs dalban s lawyer asked the court to find that there had been a violation of article of the convention and to award his client just satisfaction in the form of rol for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage the government requested the court to strike the case out of its list since according to them the applicant s widow was no longer asserting a personal interest in pursuing the proceedings in the alternative they stated that they did not dispute that there had been a violation of article of the convention but asked the court to strike the case out of its list on the ground that the supreme court of justice s judgment of march had redressed that violation with regard to the complaint under article the

how and to what extent will demirel accept the ‘ kurdish reality can his understanding of the ‘ reality be deemed to represent state policy a … the government is forced to accept certain facts now that there is armed resistance in kurdistan violence by the turkish forces could not stop the escalation and progress of the pkk workers party of kurdistan q how will the state shape its new official policy on kurdistan which aspects of the official ideology will be changed and how will they be changed what effects can this have on the daily lives of the kurdish people a … in turkey the government and the state are two very different things the state functions through institutions and bodies members of which are designated by appointment these institutions and bodies represent the power of the state the government i.e the political power carries very little weight against the power of the state that is why governments can be overthrown by the state authority so often official ideology can only be changed in the long term and the forces which are capable of changing it are non-governmental political and social forces and their struggle the essence of the ideas and action of the pkk for example is such as can change the official ideology reduce the influence of the appointed bodies of turkey s political scene and increase the weight of parliaments elected by the people in my opinion de facto the influence of the kurds and in particular that of the pkk will grow further the influence of the pkk in both the kurdish and the turkish societies will spread and deepen and as that influence grows more serious steps will be taken by governments in their policies towards recognising the ‘ kurdish reality it is evident that the state will try to obstruct the government in that process and will try to distort certain ideas and policies and it is also manifest that the government will be able to survive so long as it can resist the power of the state and control the appointed institutions and bodies i.e so long as it has real power these changes will be reflected in the daily lives of the kurds investigations and research will develop in fields such as the kurdish language history and folklore kurdish culture will be revived the specificity of a kurdish society will be emphasised more amongst the kurdish masses national awareness and desire for liberation will become stronger and will spread further the idea and feelings for independence will develop q it is now observed that kurds who until now would never have said ‘ i am kurdish and i am engaging in politics for my present life and for my future are now clearly beginning ‘ to get into politics for their own interests throughout kurdistan and turkey what sort of developments have brought about this situation do kurds need a political subject in the legal sphere if so what form should it take a without any doubt the most important cause of these developments has been the armed combat which the pkk has been waging for almost eight years the guerrilla warfare has brought about major social and political changes in traditional kurdish society traditional values are in turmoil there has been very widespread support amongst the people for kurdish guerrilla fighters ever since august national awareness is now growing in kurdish society and this process is spreading rapidly and we see that within this process the political establishment has been used for kurdish interests for the move towards autonomy and independence kurds who have always been engaged in politics for others and in order to serve other nations are now engaged in politics in order to serve the kurdish people healthy national awareness is now developing in response to turkish racism and colonialism it would no doubt be over-simplifying to say that all this began after the onset of kurdish guerrilla warfare on august this process has roots that go further back into the past but what has been decisive is the new process launched by the pkk who is illegal in kurdistan the guerrillas or the special team of the turkish armed forces q what should be done to counteract the wave of chauvinist turkish nationalism encouraged by the right-wing press and the mcp nationalist workers party is there a possibility of a confrontation between the turkish and kurdish peoples how could that be prevented a … kurds are dying for their nation what are the turks dying for what are they doing in kurdistan q it has been under discussion for some time that the pkk hegemony in kurdistan has reached a stage where one can now talk of a ‘ double power öcalan has mentioned in his writings an orientation towards the ‘ formation of a government-state in the botan-behdinan region are there any signs of what the future interventions of the pkk will be in kurdistan and in turkish politics a … the turkish state has already withdrawn its soldiers and evacuated police stations in some regions such as botan this could be perceived as the beginning of the formation of a state in an indictment dated march the public prosecutor at the istanbul national security court i̇stanbul devlet güvenlik mahkemesi charged the applicants with having disseminated propaganda against the indivisibility of the state by publishing the above interview the charges were brought under section of the prevention of terrorism act hereinafter the act see paragraph below in the proceedings before the national security court the applicants denied the charges they pleaded that the incriminated interview was a mere transcript of dr. i̇.b. s statements they maintained that the publication of an interview could not constitute an offence and that similar views had been expressed by the highest authorities in turkey in a judgment dated august the istanbul national security court found the applicants guilty of offences under section of the act the first applicant was sentenced under the second paragraph of section to five months imprisonment and a fine of turkish liras trl the second applicant was sentenced under the first paragraph of section to one year and eight months imprisonment and a fine of trl in its reasoning the court relied on certain extracts from the interviewee s statements as published it held that the following phrases amounted to propaganda against the indivisibility of the state the government is forced to accept certain facts now that there is armed resistance in kurdistan violence by the turkish forces could not stop the escalation and progress of the pkk the essence of the ideas and action of the pkk can change the official ideology the influence of the kurds and in particular that of the pkk will grow further the influence of the pkk in both the kurdish and the turkish societies will spread and deepen national awareness and desire for liberation will become stronger and will spread further the idea and feelings for independence will develop the most important cause of these developments has been the armed combat which the pkk has been waging for almost eight years who is illegal in kurdistan the guerrillas or the special team of the turkish armed forces kurds are dying for their nation what are the turks dying for what are they doing in kurdistan the turkish state has already withdrawn its soldiers and evacuated police stations in some regions such as botan this

the case was referred to the court in accordance with the provisions applicable prior to the entry into force of protocol no to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by the european commission of human rights the commission on may article of protocol no and former articles and of the convention the case originated in an application no against the republic of poland lodged with the commission under former article of the convention by a polish national józef gawęda the applicant on january the applicant alleged in particular that the polish courts had refused to register the titles of two periodicals preventing him thereby from publishing them the commission declared the application partly admissible on january in its report of december former article of the convention it expressed by twenty-five votes to one the opinion that there had been a violation of article of the convention note by the registry the report is obtainable from the registry the applicant was represented before the court by mr w. grzyb a lawyer practising in żywiec the polish government the government were represented by their agent mr k. drzewicki from the ministry of foreign affairs on march a panel of the grand chamber determined that the case should be decided by one of the sections of the court rule of the rules of court it was thereupon assigned to the first section within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule on september the bielsko-biała regional court dismissed the applicant 's request for registration of the title of a periodical the social and political monthly a european moral tribunal miesięcznik społeczno-polityczny europejski sąd moralny to be published in kęty the court considered that in accordance with the press act and the ordinance of the minister of justice on the registration of periodicals the name of a periodical should be relevant to its contents the name as proposed by the applicant would suggest that a european institution had been established in kęty which was untrue and would be misleading to prospective buyers moreover the proposed title would be disproportionate to the periodical 's actual importance and readership as it was hardly conceivable that a periodical of a european dimension could be published in kęty the court went on to state the applicant stubbornly applies for registration of periodicals the titles of which would suggest the existence in kęty of an institution of international character such as the european moral tribunal or the world tribunal of morality and when requested by the court to change the titles he declares that he will not do so. on december the katowice court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant against this decision the court stated inter alia that in the proceedings before the first-instance court the applicant had been requested to change the proposed title by deleting the term european moral tribunal but he had refused to do so subsequently the applicant made a number of further applications for the registration of periodicals he succeeded in obtaining four registrations on may the minister of justice refused to grant leave for an extraordinary appeal against the decision of december finding that it was in accordance with the law on february the bielsko-biała regional court dismissed a new request by the applicant for registration of a periodical germany a thousand-year-old enemy of poland the court noted that at a hearing on february the applicant when requested to change the proposed title so as to remove its negative character had refused to do so the court considered that registration of the periodical with the proposed title would be harmful to polish-german reconciliation and detrimental to good cross-border relations the applicant appealed against this decision submitting that it was incomprehensible and amounted to censorship on april the katowice court of appeal upheld the contested decision the court observed that the title as proposed by the applicant suggested that the proposed periodical would concentrate unduly on negative aspects of polish-german relations the court considered that such a title would be in conflict with reality in that it would give an unbalanced picture of the relevant facts the court further considered that the lower court had been justified in refusing registration on the ground that the title would be detrimental to polish-german reconciliation and to good relations between poland and germany section of the press act of january requires registration of a press title by the regional court as a prerequisite for publication of a periodical a request for registration should contain the proposed title the editor 's address the name of the editor-in-chief and other personal data the name and address of the publishing house and information on how often the periodical would be published the decision on registration is to be taken within thirty days of the date on which the request has been filed with the court the court must refuse registration if the request does not contain the required information or if the proposed title would prejudice a right to protection of the title of any existing periodical section of the press act provides that a person who publishes a periodical without the required registration is liable to a fine section a of the press act authorises the minister of justice to issue an ordinance specifying the manner in which the press register should be run section of the ordinance of the minister of justice on the registration of periodicals as applicable at the material time provided that registration was not

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two bulgarian nationals ms svetlana stoilkova yordanova and mr toshko nikolov toshev the applicants on january the first applicant was represented by mr m. ekimdzhiev and ms k. boncheva lawyers practising in the second applicant was represented by ms i. lulcheva a lawyer practising in the bulgarian government the government were represented by their agents ms s. atanasova and ms m. kotseva of the ministry of justice the applicants alleged in particular that a judgment finding them civilly liable for libel and ordering them to pay damages and costs to a person who had brought a libel claim against them had been in breach of their right to freedom of expression on may the court fifth section decided to give the government notice of the complaint concerning the interference with the applicants right to freedom of expression it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article of the convention following the recomposition of the court s sections on february the application was transferred to the fourth section the first applicant who was born in is a journalist by profession at the relevant time she was employed at trud a leading national daily newspaper as a journalist and deputy editor in the newspaper s criminal department in or she started working for hours another leading national daily newspaper the second applicant was born in at the relevant time he was trud s editorinchief on may the press service of the ministry of internal affairs announced the arrest of n.t. a former employee of the ministry and of the national investigation service the press release specified that he had been detained and charged under article of the criminal code with abusing his office with a view to obtaining pecuniary gain which had led to serious negative consequences in particular it stated that he had misappropriated concealed and used secret official documents the investigation against him was ongoing the same day this information was relayed to many newspapers by the bulgarian telegraph agency shortly after receiving the news the first applicant went to the premises of the sofia regional military prosecutor s office where along with journalists from other newspapers she tried to obtain more information about the case around noon in line with the established practice at that time a military prosecutor showed up before the journalists to make a statement about the case and answer questions in addition to the information in the press release the prosecutor said that a bag with secret documents had been found during a search of n.t. s home that n.t. s wife had also been implicated in the affair and that by using those documents which contained information about the stateowned metallurgical plant kremikovtsi n.t. s wife had engaged in lucrative business ventures involving metals the next day several national newspapers ran stories about the case the applicant also covered it in an article which appeared in the may issue of trud it bore the caption private company s shady iron business discovered the headline former police officer arrested over bag with secret documents and the applicant s byline and read a former officer was arrested after the metropolitan police found in his home a bag with secret documents it became clear yesterday n.t former officer of the ministry of internal affairs and investigator in the national investigation service was put behind bars for misappropriating concealing and using secret documents the ministry announced yesterday he has been charged under article of the criminal code with abusing his office with a view to enriching himself which has led to serious negative consequences the law provides for up to ten years imprisonment if the accused is found guilty the documents that n.t took relate to the operations and the business of the ‘ kremikovtsi metallurgical plant the law enforcement people said he gave the secret information to his wife who had a private irontrading company her business thus thrived and she amassed a substantial capital the initial investigation found the arrest took place about ten days ago the specified the handcuffs clicked on n.t s wrists three days before he was set to become a practising lawyer originals of secret documents obtained by him probably while an operative of the former district police department were found during a search of his home the whole family of n.t was implicated in the affair say persons close to the investigation the detainee s father used to be the head of the district police department but it is unclear whether he was aware of his son s deeds n.t formerly worked as an investigator in one of the district investigation services in for about a year on paper he quit of his own free will last year in reality he was asked to go because he lacked the requisite qualities for the office he occupied said people from the national investigation service yesterday the ‘ national security service of the sofia regional police department and the military prosecutor s office are making additional inquiries to uncover n.t s criminal activities said the ministry s press service yesterday the investigation has been entrusted to the sofia military prosecutor s office. on august trud published another article entitled the prosecutor s office won t let former officer out of arrest the article was authored by the first applicant but did not bear her byline it read as follows the former ministry of internal affairs officer and investigator n.t who was detained at the end of may this year on charges of misappropriating concealing and using secret documents will remain in detention we learned yesterday his detention was upheld in a prosecutor s decision issued yesterday said to the bulgarian telegraph agency the lieutenant colonel n.g of the military prosecutor s office n.t was charged under article of the criminal code with abuse of office a bag with secret documents relating to the business of the ‘ kremikovtsi metallurgical plant was found during a search of his home n.t obtained them while an operative of the former district police department he gave the information to his wife who had a private irontrading company before the investigation she said that she had carried out only one transaction. in the following years the prosecuting authorities brought n.t to trial six times but each time the referred the case back for rectification of procedural errors eventually on october the court discontinued the proceedings under a newly introduced rule of criminal procedure allowing accused persons to seek discontinuance of the proceedings against them if the case had not proceeded to trial for more than two years after the bringing of charges for more details on that rule see dimitrov and hamanov v. bulgaria nos and may on may n.t brought a civil claim against the two applicants and trud s publisher media holding ad he alleged that the two articles had defamed him by making injurious and untrue allegations which had not been based on a proper journalistic enquiry they had affected gravely both him and his family he sought compensation for nonpecuniary damage in the sum of old bulgarian levs bgl plus interest in respect of the first article and bgl plus interest in respect of the second article he also claimed costs the sofia city court held four hearings one of which was adjourned because the two applicants had not been properly summoned in a judgment of july it dismissed n.t. s claim it found that the first applicant like many other journalists had based her article on reliable official sources this excluded any wrongful conduct on her part the second applicant was therefore not liable either n.t appealed the sofia court of appeal held a hearing on january on february it upheld the lower court s judgment it found that at the time when the two articles had been published there had not existed any statutory rules governing journalistic enquiries journalists including the first applicant had been bound to adhere to the de facto rules of the profession the first applicant had not breached those rules in researching the two articles she had used many independent sources to elucidate the facts covered in both articles she had based her allegations on information from the ministry of internal affairs and the bulgarian telegraph agency and a statement made by a public prosecutor both she and the second applicant had thus fulfilled their professional duties which excluded any negligence on their part strict liability in tort did not exist under bulgarian law n.t appealed on points of law the supreme court of cassation heard the appeal at a hearing held on may on august it quashed the sofia court of appeal s judgment and remitted the case it found that that court whose task had not simply been to review the firstinstance court s judgment but to decide the case de novo had not gathered all available evidence in particular evidence relating to the identity of the public prosecutor cited in the first article and any evidence concerning the truthfulness of the second article and had not properly analysed it its findings that the allegations in the articles were true did not correspond to the material in the case the cassation court went on to say that in order to determine whether or not the applicants were liable in tort the court of appeal should have ascertained the truth or the falsity of the assertions made in the two articles because the right to freedom of expression could not be used to infringe the reputation of others on remittal the sofia court of appeal held three hearings at the second of those which took place on may the court decided to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings against n.t none of the parties appealed against that decision after criminal proceedings against n.t came to an end in october see paragraph above the court decided to resume the examination of the case and held a hearing on april in a judgment of july the sofia court of appeal allowed n.t. s claim it ordered the two applicants and media holding ad to pay him new bulgarian levs bgn plus interest in nonpecuniary damages in respect of the first article the court also ordered the second applicant and media holding ad to pay n.t bgn plus interest in nonpecuniary damages in respect of the second article lastly the court ordered the two applicants and media holding ad to pay n.t bgn in respect of costs it specified that they were jointly liable to pay those amounts the court held that in preparing the articles the first applicant had acted tortiously because she had not followed the customary rules governing journalistic enquiries those rules required that any information even that coming from official sources be checked against at least two independent sources the first applicant had not done that with regard to the information received from a public prosecutor whose identity she had been unable to establish the resulting articles had contained defamatory and injurious statements about n.t and his family which went beyond the information in the press release issued by the authorities that the business of the applicant s wife had thrived and she had amassed a substantial capital that the whole family had been implicated in the affair and that the authorities had found a bag with secret documents relating to the business of the ‘ kremikovtsi metallurgical plant by writing and publishing unverified defamatory allegations about n.t the applicants had acted in breach of the general duty under section of the obligations and contracts act see paragraph below not to infringe the rights of others they could have anticipated the damaging result of their actions and could have averted it by taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the statements in the articles they had not done so and had therefore acted negligently the second applicant had been under a duty to do so by virtue of his position as the newspaper s editorinchief especially with regard to an article that did not bear a byline as for the first applicant she had made untrue and uncorroborated injurious remarks and allegations about n.t. s personal and professional life without taking into account the negative consequences that could flow from them media holding ad was vicariously liable for the applicants actions the court determined the quantum of the award in equity as required under section of the obligations and contracts act see paragraph below it took into account trud s circulation the number of potential readers and the degree of moral suffering sustained by n.t the applicants appealed on points of law arguing among other things that the court of appeal s judgment was in breach of article of the convention on november a threemember panel of the supreme court of cassation refused to hear their appeal it observed that n.t had brought two claims of bgn each those claims had been triable at first instance not by the sofia city court but by the sofia district court by accepting to hear the case the sofia city court which had the rank of a regional court had in effect exercised its powers under article of the code of civil procedure to take up and examine at first instance a case falling within the jurisdiction of one of the district courts in its region see paragraph below that had in turn led to an appellate judgment by the sofia court of appeal had the procedure ran its normal course the case would have been examined at first instance by the sofia district court and on appeal by the sofia city court the case thus fell within the ambit of article a of the code see paragraph below with the result that no appeal lay against the sofia court of appeal s judgment on an appeal by the applicants in a final decision of january a fivemember panel of the supreme court of cassation upheld the threemember panel s decision it fully agreed with its reasoning and went on to say that the examination of the case at second instance by the sofia court of appeal due to the irregular manner in which the proceedings had unfolded in terms of which court had jurisdiction could not render a judgment concerning claims of up to bgn amenable to appeal on points of law the threshold for lodging such an appeal was primarily a function of the amount in dispute it could not be circumvented through the application of article of the abovementioned code and the resulting examination of the case at first instance by the sofia city court the relevant provisions of the constitution read as follows article the private life of citizens shall be inviolable all citizens are entitled to be protected against unlawful interference in their private or family life and against infringements of their honour dignity and reputation. article everyone is entitled to express an

information is a state secret or a secret protected by law or it affects the rights of others. article rights shall not be abused nor shall they be exercised to the detriment of the rights or the

is to be determined by the court in equity if a tort has been committed by several persons they are jointly liable for the resulting damage section article b of the code of civil procedure superseded on march by the code of civil procedure as in force between april and july provided that money claims of up to bgn were triable by the district courts and those exceeding bgn by the regional courts

the case originated in an application no against lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a romanian national mr laurian ieremeiov the applicant on october the applicant was represented by ms monica macovei and ms alexandra răzvan-mihalcea lawyers practising in bucharest and timişoara respectively and acting on behalf of the association for the defense of human rights in the helsinki committee apador on january ms monica macovei withdrew from the case following her appointment as minister of justice the romanian government the government were represented by their agent the applicant alleged in particular that the criminal proceedings for defamation brought against him had not been fair and that the imposition of a fine and the obligation to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage had breached his right to freedom of expression on may the president of the third section decided to communicate this complaint to the government it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the applicant was born in and lives in at the material time he was a journalist at the newspaper ziua de vest in on june following the local elections the newspaper ziua de vest published an article by the applicant accusing a.v.i. the newly elected mayor of buziaş of having collaborated with the securitate the intelligence service during the communist period the article featured on the third page of the newspaper was announced on the front page by the headline mayor with file primar cu dosar the relevant parts of the article read as follows citizens safety above state security the scandal of the files in buziaş the newly elected mayor a.v.i is suspected of having collaborated with the securitate the first scandal concerning the securitate files is about to burst in the town of the elected mayor a.v.i is suspected by some citizens whose names will not be made public for obvious reasons of having collaborated with the securitate based on information from inside the romanian secret service our sources said that a.v.i was under surveillance until as an irredentist chauvinist which made it impossible for him to obtain a history teaching post in buziaş during the same period a.v.i was allegedly persuaded to collaborate with the securitate and a file allegedly exists on this matter before the local elections a.v.i lodged a written statement with the electoral bureau declaring that he had not been part of the former securitate he informed us yesterday that what he had written in that statement was true and that he had never collaborated in any way with the secret police before on august a.v.i lodged a criminal complaint for insult and defamation against the applicant with timişoara district court his complaint also included the company which published the newspaper the district court heard testimonies from two witnesses who confirmed that they had told the applicant about the rumours concerning the victim 's collaboration with the securitate on october the applicant gave a statement to the court he pleaded not guilty and relied in his defence on the right to freedom of expression and the right to provide information about public figures on february the district court gave judgment in the case it considered that the applicant had not committed defamation as he had not referred to any specific offences allegedly committed by the victim it found that the expressions used by the applicant including the headline on the front page were manifestly insulting to the victim however the district court noted that the applicant had not described any of the rumours as fact and that he had also presented the victim 's point of view in the article it further considered that a certain degree of aggressiveness was common in journalism and that therefore although the facts met the legal criteria to constitute the criminal offence of insult in the circumstances of the case the acts perpetrated and their consequences were not severe enough to come within the sphere of criminal law the district court acquitted the applicant of both defamation and insult and imposed an administrative fine of romanian lei rol the court also found that the conditions had been met for the applicant 's civil liability and that of the company publishing the newspaper in respect of the prejudice caused to the victim it thus ordered the applicant and the company to pay rol to a.v.i as compensation for non-pecuniary damage lastly the applicant was ordered to pay rol to the state in court fees all parties appealed the victim contested the acquittal and sought to have the amount of damages increased the company publishing the newspaper argued that the prejudice had not been proven by the victim the applicant claimed that the legal requirements had not been fulfilled either for the existence of the offence of defamation or for the existence of insult on april the parties representatives presented the grounds for appeal orally before timiş county court the applicant was invited to speak only before the end of the hearing ultimul cuvânt al inculpatului in his address he requested that a.v.i 's appeal be dismissed the final decision was adopted on the same day the county court allowed the appeal lodged by a.v.i it acquiesced in the statement of facts established by the district court but considered that the first-instance court had failed to interpret them correctly it found that the expressions used by the applicant in particular the mayor is suspected of having collaborated with the securitate was allegedly persuaded to collaborate with the securitate and a file allegedly exists on this matter and was under surveillance as an irredentist chauvinist were manifestly defamatory and if true would expose the victim to public opprobrium at the least it considered that the applicant 's intention to denigrate was proved and that he was not therefore covered by the constitution and the convention which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression only when it was exercised in good faith however for the same reasons as the district court it considered that in the circumstances of the case the acts perpetrated and their consequences were not severe enough to come within the sphere of criminal law it therefore acquitted the applicant on both accounts and imposed on him an administrative fine of rol the court also considered that the prejudice incurred by the victim had not been correctly evaluated by the district court and increased the amount to be paid by the applicant and the newspaper company to rol it awarded a.v.i rol for costs to be paid jointly by the applicant and the company lastly the court ordered the applicant to pay rol to the state for court fees on october the applicant paid the administrative fine the relevant provisions of the civil and

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by flux the applicant a newspaper based in chişinău on september the applicant was represented by mr v. gribincea a lawyer practising in chişinău and a member of the non-governmental organisation lawyers for human rights the moldovan government the government were represented by their agent mr v. pârlog the applicant alleged in particular a breach of its right to freedom of expression on account of its having been found guilty of defamation of a politician on february the court decided to give notice of the application to the government under the provisions of article of the convention it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility on june flux published on its first page the title of an article due to appear in a future issue together with a summary of the article the title of the summary was the red millionaires and it was accompanied by a big picture of the leader of the communist party parliamentary group victor stepaniuc wearing a top hat the summary read as follows the communists want to sell off piece-meal the anenii noi canned food plant the anenii noi plant is the only undertaking in the region which is still alive the rest of the plants have been sold off piece-meal since the communists came to power a campaign to liquidate this plant has commenced certain members of the parliament of moldova wish to dismantle it and sell it off piece-meal sources from the plant told our newspaper that the member of parliament m.a. who is responsible for with the support of the main creditors is behind this dirty affair having great influence and parliamentary immunity he wants to fill his pockets following the sale of the plant at present the plant is not operating and is making substantial losses and this situation is being used to maximum advantage by this mp since the plant is not operating and is not profitable the shareholders want to liquidate it the problem is that the plant could operate if the shareholders did not hinder the plant 's staff a detailed article about this affair will be published in the friday issue on page the next day on june mr stepaniuc brought civil defamation proceedings against the newspaper and against the author of the article he argued inter alia that the defendants disseminated information which is defamatory of me as a citizen an mp and as the leader of the communist party parliamentary group the article which is accompanied by my picture contains the following defamatory statements 'the communists want to sell the anenii noi canned food plant off piece-meal 'since the communists came to power a campaign to liquidate this plant has commenced certain members of the parliament of moldova wish to dismantle it and sell it off piece-meal by publishing this article the defendants acted in bad faith misinforming public opinion about my actions in my capacity as mp and also about the activity of the communist party parliamentary group which i represent accusing us of destroying an enterprise which is part of the national economy. on june flux published the article announced in its june issue the article was based on the account of v.n. the deputy chief executive officer of the anenii noi canned food plant and reported on events concerning alleged attempts by a communist parliamentarian m.a to have the plant declared bankrupt and sold off it stated inter alia that the parliamentarian had made use of the tax authority and other state bodies for that purpose and that he m.a had told v.n that his actions were supported by the communist party parliamentary group according to v.n. three other plants from the region had already been declared bankrupt and sold off in the same manner on august judge i.m. who was also president of the buiucani district court ruled in favour of mr stepaniuc relying on the following grounds from the content and meaning of the article of june it is clear that flux and the author made defamatory and false accusations against mr stepaniuc in particular to the effect that he in his capacity as mp and leader of the communist party parliamentary group had engaged in actions directed at destroying enterprises within the national economy of the republic of moldova for personal gain in addition the article was accompanied by a picture of the plaintiff the defendants did not present in the article any proof of the truthfulness of their accusations in such circumstances the court considers it necessary to note that any article should be sincere correct and contain only truthful revelations which correspond to reality and are not based on rumours anonymous letters or inadequately checked information from unreliable sources the defendants however did not abide by common sense and unjustly defamed the plaintiff accordingly the defendants clearly overstepped the limits of constructive criticism of public persons necessary in a democratic society in the court 's view the fact that the plaintiff 's name was not given in the article is not conclusive since his picture and the meaning and content of the article make it clear that it is directed against him consequently he was exposed to mental and moral suffering which should be remedied by the defendants in establishing the compensation to be paid for non-pecuniary damage the court shall take into consideration the considerable vehemence of the attack against mr stepaniuc the large readership of the newspaper and the degree of suffering endured by the plaintiff the court should also take into consideration the public functions occupied by mr stepaniuc that of mp and leader of a parliamentary group which should increase the award for moral damage therefore the court considers it necessary to award the plaintiff the maximum amount of compensation provided for by the law. the court found the statement the communists want to sell the anenii noi canned food plant off piece-meal to be defamatory and ordered the newspaper and the author to pay the plaintiff moldovan lei mdl the equivalent of euros eur at the time and mdl respectively it further ordered the newspaper to issue an apology within fifteen days the defendants were also ordered to pay the court fees the newspaper lodged an appeal against the judgment in which it argued inter alia that the article had been directed against m.a. another mp from the communist party parliamentary group and not against mr stepaniuc the latter 's picture had been published in order to make it easy to identify the communist party parliamentary group since he was its president the applicant also argued that the impugned article was only an abstract of an article to be published subsequently and that the statement found by the first-instance court to be defamatory was merely a subjective conclusion drawn by the author based on the information published in the main article the applicant further submitted that m.a had also instituted defamation proceedings against the newspaper and requested that the two actions instituted by mr stepaniuc and by m.a be joined and examined together the applicant finally argued that judge i.m lacked independence and impartiality because he was a friend of mr stepaniuc and had been appointed president of the buiucani district court by the communist party parliamentary group the majority of the defamation cases between flux and mr stepaniuc were examined by him personally and his decisions were stereotyped in other defamation cases between flux and representatives of the government judge i.m had always ruled in favour of the latter and had awarded them the maximum amount provided for by law on february the dismissed the appeal as being unfounded it did not take into consideration the article published on june the newspaper lodged an appeal on points of law relying on the same grounds as in its appeal and added inter alia that the impugned article merely reproduced the opinion of the management of the anenii noi canned food plant on april the court of appeal dismissed the appeal it stated inter alia that it was clear that the information published in the article about mr stepaniuc did not correspond to reality moreover his picture had been attached to the article it appears that the defamation action brought by m.a against flux was struck out due to m.a 's failure to appear before the court article protection of honour and dignity any natural or legal person shall be entitled to apply to the courts to seek the withdrawal of statements which are damaging to his or her honour and dignity and do not correspond to reality as well as statements which are not damaging to honour and dignity but do not correspond to reality when the media body which circulated such statements is not capable of proving that these statements correspond to reality the court shall compel the publishing office of the media body to publish not later then days after the entry into force of the judicial decision a withdrawal of the statements in the same column on the same page or in the same programme or series of broadcasts. article compensation for moral damage the moral damage caused to a person as a result of circulation through the mass media or by organisations or persons of statements which do not correspond to reality as well as statements concerning his or her private or family life without his or her consent shall be compensated by way of a pecuniary award the amount of the award shall be determined by the court the amount of the award shall be determined by the court in each case as an amount equal to between and months minimum wages if the information has been circulated by a legal person and between and month 's minimum wages if the information has been circulated by a natural person. in the principle of the rule of law was under challenge in this was evidenced by the rising number of cases filed by moldovan citizens in the european court of human rights and actions taken by the parliament and government to suppress judicial independence also affecting the fragile balance of power among the legislative executive and judicial branches of government in were a series of judicial nominations based on loyalty to the ruling party the dismissal of the ombudsman and attempts to limit the independence of the in april the moldovan association of judges maj signaled that the government had started a process of mass cleansing in the judicial sector seven judges lost their jobs including tudor lazar a member of the court of appeals and gheorghe ulianovschi the chairman of the chisinau tribunal in the case of lazar the move was likely revenge for decisions by the court of appeals that favored the and local oil importers over the government the situation worsened when president voronin refused to prolong the mandates of other judges the maj conveyed a statement on the matter to coe rapporteurs who were in chisinau at the time on a fact-finding mission the government instructed the ministry of justice to delay court decisions related to the payment of material damages by state institutions in october gheorghe susarenco chairman of the moldovan association of judges stated at a press conference that senior government officials were pressuring judges to issue rulings that favored government bodies in december president voronin promulgated a constitutional amendment giving him the right to appoint judges under the amendment the head of state will appoint the chairs of courts their deputies and lower-ranking judges for four-year terms at the recommendation of the higher council of magistrates parliament will appoint for four-year terms members of the supreme court of justice including the chief of the supreme court of justice the prosecutor-general and the minister of justice these changes provide evidence that the country 's communist leaders are weakening judicial independence and subordinating this branch of governance to their authority the united states department of state country report on read as follows in its relevant parts the constitution provides for an independent judiciary however official pressure and corruption of judges remained a problem there continued to be credible reports that local prosecutors and judges extorted bribes for reducing charges or sentences following a major reorganization in may the judiciary consists of three levels lower courts courts of appeals and the supreme court a separate has exclusive authority in cases regarding the constitutionality of draft and final legislation decrees and other government acts while the was generally regarded as fair and objective observers frequently charged that other courts were corrupt or politically influenced the constitution authorizes the president acting on the nomination of the superior court of magistrates to appoint judges for an initial period of years before being reappointed judges must undertake specialized judicial training and pass a test evaluated by the superior council of judges political factors have played a large role in the reappointment of judges. according to reports provided by the applicant and not contested by the respondent state at the relevant time there were a series of nominations to the bench based on loyalty to the ruling party the dismissal of the ombudsman and attempts to limit the independence of the the moldovan association of judges had recorded that the government had started a 'mass cleansing of the judicial sector seven judges had been ousted outright and the president of the republic failed to prolong the mandate of other judges the chairman of the association of judges declared publicly to the media the senior government officials were pressurising judges to issue rulings that favoured government bodies by virtue of a constitutional amendment the president was given the right to appoint judges and select the chairs of courts their deputies and lower-ranking judges for four year terms at the recommendation of the higher council of magistrates parliament by political majority vote was given the power to appoint for four year terms members of the supreme court including its president the prosecutor-general and the minister of justice another report the u.s. department of state country report on for underlined that official pressure and corruption of judges remained a problem observers frequently charged that other courts were corrupt or politically influenced political factors have played a large part in the reappointment of judges the report of the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights com has made no mystery of the fact the the independence of the judiciary in is a serious worry it pointed out the exercise of powers of appointment reappointment and dismissal of judges vested in the president of the republic as a serious interference with the independence of the judiciary the commissioner 's office delegation had sought in vain to establish what guarantees apply in the procedure leading to the non re-appointment of judges the report concluded that it follows that the present presidential practice on appointment and re-appointment of judges does not provide sufficient rule of law guarantees and seems therefore arbitrary it is thus urgent that the presidential practice be revised in order to safeguard judicial independence and the rule of law similarly the international commission of jurists painted the bleakest of pictures on the functioning of the judiciary following a joint mission to moldova with the centre for the independence of judges and lawyers in february its report dated november slammed virtually everything relating to the appointment tenure of office and removal of judges it found these to be wholly out of line with basic minimum european guarantees for the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and noted the massive return of telephone justice by the executive and the legislative to control the decisions of judges in the same vein was the statement of the international helsinki federation for human rights on violations of the freedom of the media and the independence of the judiciary in moldova dated june which claimed that the federation was deeply concerned about the gross violations of the freedom of the media and the independence of the judiciary the judiciary continues to face excessive political intrusion the status of judges is insecure due to the re-appointment procedure the highly questionable overhaul of the judiciary system and precedents of politically motivated extralegal dismissal of judges the abolition of the guarantees of a life term for judges and the large number of removals also put additional pressure on the judges a basically uncritical mode of operation resulting in further possibilities for executive control over the judiciary and infringements of the separation of powers a wider spectrum of non-domestic observations on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in moldova is to be found in the first annex to the i.c.j report mentioned

the case originated in an application no against the slovak republic lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a slovakian national mr alexej lešník the applicant on march the applicant who had been granted legal aid was represented by mr j. hrubala a lawyer practising in banská bystrica the slovakian government the government were represented by their agent mr p. vršanský the applicant alleged in particular that his right to freedom of expression had been violated as a result of his conviction for statements in respect of a public prosecutor the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the second section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule this case was assigned to the newly composed fourth section by a decision of january the chamber declared the application partly admissible the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits rule the chamber decided after consulting the parties that no hearing on the merits was required rule in fine the applicant was born in and lives in košice he is a businessman on december the applicant requested the košice city prosecutor s office to bring criminal proceedings against h. a businessman from the czech republic whom he suspected of having committed fraud the request was examined by various authorities but no criminal proceedings were brought on december the applicant complained to the police that two unknown men had left a message at the entrance to his flat saying that they would break his hands if he did not abstain from writing on april the applicant complained to the police that a shot had been fired through a window in his flat he claimed that he was being harassed because he had written articles about several former members of the communist party subsequently the applicant was informed that the police could not identify the perpetrators on april the applicant complained to the head of the košice telecommunications authority that following a change of the central switchboard telephone conversations at his agency were frequently interrupted the applicant stated that there was a noise on the telephone prior to the interruption of a call which was similar to that which had formerly occurred when telephone calls were tapped by the communist secret police he requested that the fault be remedied on june a police investigator brought criminal proceedings against the applicant on the ground that he was suspected of having stolen goods from h. the decision was based on a written communication by the district prosecutor in semily czech republic on november the applicant asked the košice regional prosecutor to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him in his letter the applicant complained without providing further details that the police investigator dealing with his case had obtained information on him by unlawfully tapping his telephone he requested that criminal proceedings be brought against a person or persons unknown for illegal telephone tapping on december the applicant addressed a letter to p. the košice i district prosecutor the letter contained inter alia the following statements since you have not succeeded comrade prosecutor in attaining your aims in one area you continue energetically in accordance with the practice of the former state security agents to fabricate another case against the applicant as you have learned to do under the so-called infallible socialist law on this occasion i can assure you however that i have not bowed to the high representatives of the former political system and in particular the former state security agents who paid at least as much attention to my person as you do now i do not intend today to let myself be intimidated especially not by individuals such as yourself a person with a dubious past not to speak of your other qualities it is not only my earlier experience of managing a detective agency which makes it difficult for me to associate you with objectivity professionalism and respect for the law i would therefore like to remind you on this occasion that you are also bound by the law despite the fact that you probably consider yourself to be an almighty lord of the tatra mountains and the váh river and as such beyond anyone s reach as you are for the time being under the protective hand of comrade m. abuse of the law may have very unpleasant consequences for you for the time being i will only mention some of the abuses which do not call for any comments. in the letter the applicant further stated that the addressee was responsible for the dismissal of his criminal complaint against h. and the institution of criminal proceedings against him in and that he had unlawfully ordered the tapping of his telephone p. submitted the letter to his hierarchical superior the košice regional prosecutor in a letter of march the latter informed the applicant that it had not been established that p. had given an order to tap his telephone or that he had otherwise acted unlawfully in the meantime on march the applicant complained to the general prosecutor that p. had committed an offence in that he had misused his authority the letter read inter alia as follows p. accepted the request of h. s lawyer that no criminal proceedings would be brought against h. in slovakia notwithstanding that sufficient evidence existed to do so of course money paid by h. with a view to covering up his fraudulent activity also played a role in the matter it would therefore be worth examining in this context whether an offence of bribery was not committed following a threat by an investigator from the košice i investigation office in the context of the case of h. i went to the aforesaid office on june after i had rejected an ‘ agreement which was proposed to me the investigator a former state security agent accused me of having stolen goods from h. in thus p. has been unwilling to bring proceedings against h. since and has arranged through a police investigator who can easily be blackmailed for proceedings to be brought against me in revenge for the justified complaints i had lodged against him p. did so contrary to the relevant provisions of the code of criminal procedure because so far there is no evidence before the relevant authorities from which to conclude with sufficient certainty that i stole anything from h. subsequently i realised that my telephone which was also used by my detective agency had been tapped contrary to article of the code of criminal procedure. on a petition by p. the general prosecutor s office agreed that criminal proceedings be brought against the applicant for insulting a public prosecutor the case was transferred to a public prosecutor in liptovský mikuláš on june the applicant was charged with insulting a public official in his letters of december and march mentioned above in a letter of september addressed to the košice regional prosecutor s office the applicant expressed the view that the purpose of the harassment to which he was subjected in and had been to make him withdraw his criminal complaint against h. he requested that an investigation be opened in september the newspaper necenzurované noviny published an article by a third person describing the applicant s case in detail it was entitled how the red plague operates in eastern slovakia and contained quotations from the applicant s letters the relevant parts read as follows it is on this basis that the district prosecutor s office in liptovský mikuláš started a prosecution against the applicant on june in order to give the reader an idea of what is possible in slovakia i will quote the text which according to public prosecutor l. constitutes a criminal offence in his message of march addressed to the general prosecutor in bratislava the applicant stated in respect of public prosecutor p. that in the criminal case of h. he had deliberately acted wrongly so that ‘ he could satisfy his friend m. from košice the former president of the košice city court whom the city committee of the communist party of slovakia had identified as a key official and who is now h. s lawyer that no criminal proceedings would be brought against h. in slovakia notwithstanding that sufficient evidence existed to do so of course money paid by h. with a view to covering up his fraudulent activity also played a role in the matter it would therefore be worth examining in this context whether the facts do not fall under articles and of the criminal code which govern the offence of bribery in the same document the applicant stated ‘ subsequently i realised that my telephone which was also used by my detective agency had been tapped contrary to article of the code of criminal procedure. in a letter dated december and addressed to public prosecutor p. the applicant stated among other things ‘ since you have not succeeded comrade prosecutor in attaining your aims in one area you continue energetically in accordance with the practice of the former state security agents to fabricate another case as you have learned to do under the so-called infallible socialist law on this occasion i can assure you however that i have not bowed to the high representatives of the former political system and in particular the former state security agents who paid at least as much attention to my person as you do now i do not intend today to let myself be intimidated especially not by individuals such as yourself a person with a dubious past not to speak of your other qualities in the same letter the applicant went on ‘ it is not only my earlier experience of managing a detective agency which makes it difficult for me to associate you with objectivity professionalism and respect for the law i would therefore like to remind you on this occasion that you are also bound by the law despite the fact that you probably consider yourself to be an almighty lord of the tatra mountains and the váh river and as such beyond anyone s reach since you are for the time being under the protective hand of comrade m. abuse of the law may have very unpleasant consequences for you for the time being i will only mention some of the abuses which do not call for any comments. thus on the basis of these statements prosecutor l. on the instructions of the general prosecutor started a prosecution against the applicant every decent person must be astonished to learn of such stupid behaviour. on november the applicant stated before the prosecutor in liptovský mikuláš that he had intended to criticise p. for his wrongful actions but not to insult him he further informed the public prosecutor dealing with the case that he had not written any newspaper article on the issue but had merely provided the author with the relevant documents on november the košice regional prosecutor submitted a document to the district prosecutor s office in liptovský mikuláš indicating with reference to the relevant register that the košice i district prosecutor had not ordered the tapping of the applicant s telephone between and on november the liptovský mikuláš district prosecutor indicted the applicant before the liptovský mikuláš district court on the charge of insulting a public official on november the liptovský mikuláš district court transferred the case to the košice i district court for reasons of jurisdiction as the public prosecutor affected by the applicant s statements was responsible for the same district the košice regional court on march transferred the case to the trebišov district court on april the trebišov district court issued a penal order in which it convicted the applicant of attacking a public official on the ground that in his letters of december and march he had insulted a public prosecutor the court sentenced the applicant to four months imprisonment suspended for a probationary period of one year the applicant appealed against the order the case was assigned to another judge on june the trebišov district court convicted the applicant under article of the criminal code of insulting a public official and sentenced him to four months imprisonment suspended for a probationary period of one year the judgment stated in particular that in his letters the applicant had alleged that the public prosecutor had deliberately acted improperly as regards the applicant s request of for criminal proceedings to be brought against h. that the public prosecutor had done so at the request of the lawyer representing h. and that h. had paid a sum of money for this purpose the district court also noted that the applicant had accused p. of having been unwilling to uphold his criminal complaint of having ordered criminal proceedings to be brought against him and of having his telephone illegally tapped the judgment further stated that the applicant had not shown that the public prosecutor in question had failed to act in accordance with the law the court therefore concluded that the applicant s statements were defamatory and grossly offensive the district court did not accept the applicant s defence that the sole purpose of his letters had been to have his request for criminal proceedings to be brought against h. dealt with appropriately the court noted that besides the two letters in question the applicant had sent a considerable number of other complaints concerning the same issue which however had contained no defamatory or offensive remarks both the košice regional prosecutor s office and the general prosecutor s office had dealt with the applicant s complaints and had dismissed them as being unsubstantiated the applicant appealed both personally and through his lawyer he alleged that the purpose of his remarks had been to prevent further delays in the proceedings concerning his criminal complaint of and not to offend p. he further claimed that the statements in question were not offensive and did not constitute an offence on september the košice regional court dismissed the appeal after hearing evidence from the applicant and asking him to substantiate his allegations the regional court found that in the statements made in his letters of december and march the applicant had grossly insulted a public prosecutor without justification in particular it stated that the applicant had failed to substantiate his allegation that h. had paid a sum of money in order to prevent criminal proceedings being brought against him and reiterated that the general prosecutor s office had not established that p. had acted unlawfully in this or any other respect the regional court further considered defamatory and grossly offensive the applicant s statements that the public prosecutor had acted in accordance with the practice of the former state security agents had a dubious past not to speak of his other qualities and possibly considered himself to be an almighty lord of the tatra mountains and the váh river who was beyond anyone s reach in the regional court s view the applicant had failed to show that he had a justified reason to make such statements the court did not accept the applicant s argument that he had doubts about the past and qualities of the public prosecutor because the latter had studied socialist law had failed to take appropriate action on the applicant s criminal complaint of and initiated criminal proceedings against him in its judgment the regional court pointed out that the applicant had not been hindered in seeking redress before the appropriate authorities for the actions of p. which he considered inappropriate or unlawful it held however that by making defamatory and offensive remarks the applicant had committed an attack against a public official within the meaning of article of the criminal code the regional court upheld the sentence which the district court had imposed on the applicant on october the košice iv district office revoked the trading licence under which the applicant had been authorised inter alia to run a detective agency on the ground that he had been convicted of an offence on december the košice regional office dismissed the applicant s appeal against this decision on june the košice regional court quashed the administrative decisions concerning the revocation of the applicant s trading licence and remitted the case to the košice regional office in its judgment the regional court noted that both administrative authorities deciding at lower instances had failed to establish any relevant legal grounds for their decisions on november the trebišov district court issued a decision noting that the applicant had not committed any offence during the probationary period and stating that he was to be considered as not having been convicted as from january the relevant law was amended in that persons wishing to run private security agencies were required to obtain the approval of the police headquarters the applicant did not ask for such approval and returned his trading licence of january under which he had been allowed to run a detective agency to the košice iv district office on june in the meantime on february he registered with the relevant authorities as running a different business he attached a certificate indicating that his criminal record was clean and received a new trading licence on april article of the criminal code provides that a person who utters grossly offensive or defamatory remarks in respect of a public official relating to that official s exercise of his or her powers shall be punished by up to one year s imprisonment or a fine,case originated application slovak republic lodged european commission human rights

active in company d. in the second half of the same year the trade union was informed of an intention to sell company d. and that one of the possible buyers was company g. the employees of company d. opposed the project and in order to express their opinion requested the trade union to organise a protest demonstration this it did in front of the parliament building the applicant as chairman of the trade union gave interviews to several newspapers concerning the events on december a daily newspaper színes mai lap published an article which reported the planned sale of company d. and described the demonstration analysing the background to the events it interviewed the applicant who made the following statements the other reason for which we are holding a demonstration is that employees should not lose their livelihood and that such a company i.e company g. which tramples constitutional and labour rights should not be the successor of company d. because of the inhuman conduct of the

fresh proceedings the district court found on november that the applicant had tarnished the plaintiff s good reputation by the impugned statements and ordered him to publish a rectification and pay the plaintiff s court fees in the amount of huf approximately eur it established that the applicant s assertions were statements of fact rather than value judgments it also noted that although it was true that numerous civil and labour proceedings had been instituted against company g. this fact could not justify defamatory statements the district court refused the applicant s request to obtain the decisions adopted in those other proceedings or to hear witnesses who might be able to prove the veracity of his assertions it was of the view that this evidence could not possibly render lawful his statements which in any event were exaggerated and offensive the applicant appealed on april the upheld the first-instance decision it held that the applicant s assertions were value judgments based on factual allegations expressed in a wholly unlawful manner since he had articulated his views in a gratuitously insulting offensive and harsh way. the also referred to a decision of the supreme court which had come to the same conclusion in another defamation case instituted directly by company g. against the applicant it established that the protection of the rights of others

company d. had many employees the applicant lodged a petition for review with the supreme court he pointed out that the final decision had erroneously found his assertions to be statements of fact since they were the expression of an opinion based on true facts the applicant also stressed that his aim had been to inform the public about an important matter lastly he was of the view that in expressing his opinion he could not have harmed anyone s reputation even if he had used harsh terms and that he had acted in compliance with relevant domestic law the well-established case-law of the and the supreme court as well as with european standards on september a single judge of the supreme court declared the applicant s petition inadmissible it found that the final decision had been

the case originated in an application no against the republic of finland lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a finnish national mr markus veikko pentikäinen the applicant on february the applicant was represented by mr risto ryti a lawyer practising in helsinki the finnish government the government were represented by their agent mr arto kosonen of the ministry for foreign affairs the applicant alleged in particular that his freedom of expression had been violated due to the fact that he had been arrested and found guilty of having disobeyed the police when the police tried to prevent him from doing his job as a journalist and photographer on may the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the applicant was born in and lives in helsinki the applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine suomen kuvalehti on september he was sent by his employer to take photographs of the demonstration which was being held in protest against the on-going asia-europe meeting asem in helsinki the demonstration was an exceptionally large one in the finnish context and all media followed it closely before the demonstration took place on august the helsinki police department was alerted by the finnish security intelligence that the upcoming smash asem demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message the police department did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration the demonstration was to start at p.m. on september a separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place at the start of the demonstration bottles stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers the police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching the crowd tried to break through the police defence line relying on all the information in their possession the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent the police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene this announcement was repeated several times hundreds of people then left voluntarily after the escalation of violence the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area first only a few people were allowed to leave the area then the police established several exit routes and people were allowed to leave when leaving they were asked to show id and their belongings were checked however the core group of around people remained in one of the demonstration spots including the applicant and a former member of parliament all of whom had been asked to leave the scene failing which they would be arrested according to the applicant he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrators he claims that sometime later he indicated to the police that he was a representative of the media he further claims that he was wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this after having called his colleague the applicant decided to stay until the situation was over a short time later the police arrested the demonstrators when leaving the scene the applicant was also arrested the police arrested altogether persons in the context of the demonstration the applicant was detained from september at p.m. until september at p.m. that is hours on may the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for disobeying the police niskoittelu poliisia vastaan tredska mot polis under chapter section subsection of the penal code on december the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten found the applicant guilty of disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him the court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them it appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist according to the arresting officer this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared it appeared also from the witness statements that two other photographers who had been in the sealed-off area had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested the court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody the court balanced the article right against other interests finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant among others including the former member of parliament to leave the scene the interference with the applicant s right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder the interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation however relying on chapter section of the penal code no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable the court found that the applicant who as a journalist was confronted with contradictory expectations stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer by letter dated january the applicant appealed to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten claiming that the district court should have dismissed the charges against him he argued that his arrest and the fact that he was found guilty were against the constitution and article of the convention the applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder the district court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were necessary in a democratic society and had thereby failed to justify the interference on april the court of appeal rejected the applicant s appeal without giving any further reasons by letter dated june the applicant further appealed to the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the court of appeal on september the supreme court refused the applicant leave to appeal according to chapter section subsection of the penal code rikoslaki strafflagen

punishment is to be deemed unreasonable or pointless in particular taking into account the factors referred to above in section paragraph and section or the actions by the social security and health authorities or the offence would not have an essential effect on the total sentence due to the provisions on sentencing to a joint punishment. section subsections of the criminal records act

the case originated in an application no against the republic of austria lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by an austrian national the applicant on june the president of the section granted the applicant anonymity of her own motion rule of the rules of court the applicant was represented before the court by ghenefframisommer a law firm based in vienna the austrian government the government were represented by their agent ambassador h. tichy head of the international law department at the federal ministry for europe integration and foreign affairs the applicant complained that her criminal conviction for disparaging religious doctrines herabwürdigung religiöser lehren had violated her right to freedom of expression under article of the convention on december the complaint concerning the alleged violation of article of the convention was communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court third-party observations were received from the european centre for law and justice which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in vienna from january she held several seminars entitled basic information on islam grundlagen des islams at the right-wing freedom party education institute bildungsinstitut der freiheitlichen partei österreichs the seminars were not only open to members of the freedom party or invited guests but were also publicly advertised on its website in addition the head of the freedom party h.-c.s. had distributed a leaflet specifically aimed at young voters advertising them as top seminars in the framework of a free education package the applicant had not been involved in the selection of participants two of the seminars were held on october and november respectively with around thirty participants at each one of the participants was an undercover journalist working for a weekly journal n. at the journal s request a preliminary investigation was instituted against the applicant and on february she was questioned by the police concerning certain statements she had made during the seminars which had been directed against the doctrines of islam on august the vienna public prosecutor s office staatsanwaltschaft wien the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant pursuant to article of the criminal code for inciting to hatred verhetzung hearings were held on november and on january and february at the hearing on january the vienna regional criminal court landesgericht für strafsachen wien the regional court informed the applicant that the court might adopt a different legal classification in the matter from the one contained in the charge the hearing was therefore postponed to give her time to properly prepare a defence at the end of the hearing on february the regional court acquitted the applicant in relation to several of the statements originally included in the indictment under article of the criminal code this was partly because the public prosecutor had withdrawn the indictment concerning certain statements and partly because it could not be established that the applicant had made some of the other statements exactly or at least approximately as they were worded in the indictment she was however convicted of disparaging religious doctrines herabwürdigung religiöser lehren pursuant to article of the criminal code concerning the three remaining statements she was ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and a dayfine of euros eur for a period of days amounting to eur in total which would result in sixty days imprisonment in the event of default the court considered the applicant s repeated infringements to be an aggravating factor and the fact that she did not have a previous criminal record to be a mitigating factor the court found her guilty of publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society namely muhammad the prophet of islam in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation geeignet berechtigtes ärgernis zu erregen the statements which the court found incriminating were the following english translation i./ one of the biggest problems we are facing today is that muhammad is seen as the ideal man the perfect human the perfect muslim that means that the highest commandment for a male muslim is to imitate muhammad to live his life this does not happen according to our social standards and laws because he was a warlord he had many women to put it like this and liked to do it with children and according to our standards he was not a perfect human we have huge problems with that today that muslims get into conflict with democracy and our value system the most important of all hadith collections recognised by all legal schools the most important is the sahih al-bukhari if a hadith was quoted after bukhari one can be sure that all muslims would recognise it and unfortunately in al-bukhari the thing with aisha and child sex is written i remember my sister i have said this several times already when s.w made her famous statement in graz my sister called me and asked for god s sake did you tell s.w that to which i answered no it wasn t me but you can look it up it s not really a secret. and her you can t say it like that and me a and a six-year-old what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia her well one has to paraphrase it say it in a more diplomatic way. my sister is symptomatic we have heard that so many times those were different times it wasn t okay back then and it s not okay today full stop and it is still happening today one can never approve of something like that they all create their own reality because the truth is so cruel the regional court found that the above statements essentially conveyed the message that muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies it stated that the applicant was referring to a marriage which muhammad had concluded with aisha a six-year-old and consummated when she had been nine the court found that by making those statements the applicant had suggested that muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship however it also found that it could not be established that the applicant had intended to decry all muslims she was not suggesting that all muslims were paedophiles but was criticising the unreflecting imitation of a role model according to the court the common definition of paedophilia was a primary sexual interest in children who had not yet reached puberty because paedophilia was behaviour which was ostracised by society and outlawed it was evident that the applicant s statements were capable of causing indignation the court concluded that the applicant had intended to wrongfully accuse muhammad of having paedophilic tendencies even though criticising child marriages was justifiable she had accused a subject of religious worship of having a primary sexual interest in children s bodies which she had deduced from his marriage with a child disregarding the point that the marriage had continued until the prophet s death when aisha had already turned eighteen and had therefore passed the age of puberty in addition the court found that because of the public nature of the seminars which had not been limited to members of the freedom party it was conceivable that at least some of the participants might have been disturbed by the statements the regional court further stated that anyone who wished to exercise their rights under article of the convention was subject to duties and responsibilities such as refraining from making statements which hurt others without reason and therefore did not contribute to a debate of public interest a balancing exercise between the rights under article on the one hand and those under article on the other needed to be carried out the court considered that the applicant s statements were not statements of fact but derogatory value judgments which exceeded the permissible limits it held that the applicant had not intended to approach the topic in an objective manner but had directly aimed to degrade muhammad the court stated that child marriages were not the same as paedophilia and were not only a phenomenon of islam but also used to be widespread among the european ruling dynasties furthermore the court reasoned that freedom of religion as protected by article of the convention was one of the foundations of a democratic society those who invoked their freedom of religion could not expect to be exempt from criticism and even had to accept the negation of their beliefs however the manner in which religious views were attacked could engage the state s responsibility in order to guarantee the peaceful exercise of the rights under article presenting objects of religious worship in a provocative way capable of hurting the feelings of the followers of that religion could be conceived as a malicious violation of the spirit of tolerance which was one of the bases of a democratic society the court concluded that the interference with the applicant s freedom of expression in the form of a criminal conviction had been justified as it had been based in law and had been necessary in a democratic society namely in order to protect religious peace in austria the applicant appealed arguing that the impugned statements were statements of fact not value judgments she referred to several of the documents which she had submitted as evidence which in her view clearly confirmed that when muhammad had been fifty-six years old he had had sexual intercourse with the nine-year-old aisha she stated that it was no more than reasonable to present those facts in the light of the values of today s society it had not been her intention to disparage muhammad she had merely criticised the notion that an adult had had sexual intercourse with a nine-year-old child and raised the question whether this amounted to paedophilia if one were to follow the arguments of the regional court it would mean that someone who had married a child and managed to maintain the marriage until the child had come of age could not be described as a paedophile she further contended that she had not used the term paedophile in the strict scientific sense but in the way it was used in everyday language referring to men who had sex with minors she stated that she had never said that muhammad had been a paedophile because he had married a child but because he had had sexual intercourse with one in any event her statements were covered by her rights under article of the convention which included the right to impart opinions and ideas that offended shocked or disturbed on december the vienna court of appeal oberlandesgericht wien hereinafter the court of appeal dismissed the applicant s appeal confirming in essence the legal and factual findings of the lower court the regional court had based its findings on the facts as submitted by the applicant namely that muhammad had married aisha when she had been six years old and consummated the marriage when she had been nine it had rightly made a distinction between child marriages and paedophilia it had not based its findings on an unpredictable definition of the term paedophilia but on a common definition which was comparable to that used by the world health organisation as regards the alleged violation of article of the convention the court of appeal referring to the court s case-law i̇.a v. turkey no echr and aydın tatlav v. turkey no may found that it had to examine whether the comments at issue were merely provocative or had been intended as an abusive attack on the prophet of islam it concluded that the latter was the case as muslims would find the applicant s statements he liked to do it with children the thing with aisha and child sex and a and a six-year-old what do you call that give me an example what do we call it if it is not paedophilia wrong and offensive even if muhammad had married a six-year-old and had had intercourse with her when she had been nine the court of appeal stated that the reason for the applicant s conviction had not been that the events had purportedly taken place more than a thousand years ago and similar conduct would no longer be tolerable under today s criminal law and contemporary moral and value concepts but because the applicant had accused muhammad of paedophilia by using the plural form children child sex what do we call it if it is not paedophilia without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty moreover there were no reliable sources for that allegation as no documentary evidence existed to suggest that his other wives or concubines had been similarly young on the contrary his first wife had been fifteen years older than him as could be seen from the documents submitted by the applicant herself even if the applicant had had the right to criticise others attempts to imitate muhammad her statements showed her intention to unnecessarily disparage and deride muslims harsh criticism of churches or religious societies religionsgesellschaften and religious traditions and practices was lawful however the permissible limits were exceeded where criticism ended and insults or mockery of a religious belief or person of worship beschimpfung oder verspottung einer religion oder von ihr verehrten personen began the interference with the applicant s freedoms under article of the convention had therefore been justified as to the applicant s argument that those who had participated in the seminar knew of her critical approach and could not be offended the court of appeal found that the public seminar had been offered for free to young voters by the austrian freedom party education institute and at least one participant had been offended as her complaints had led to the applicant being charged on april the applicant lodged a request for a renewal of the proceedings antrag auf erneuerung des strafverfahrens with the supreme court oberster gerichtshof pursuant to article of the code of criminal procedure strafprozessordnung and relying on article article and article of the convention on june the applicant lodged her application with the court on december the supreme court dismissed the request for a renewal of the proceedings as regards the alleged violation of article it found that the applicant s conviction under article of the criminal code constituted an interference with the right to freedom of expression which had however been justified under article of the convention referring to the court s case-law otto-preminger-institut v. austria september series a no i̇.a. cited above wingrove v. the united kingdom november reports of judgments and decisions aydın tatlav cited above and giniewski v. france no echr it held that the aim of the interference had been to protect religious peace and the religious feelings of others and was therefore legitimate the court had stated many times that in the context of religion member states had a duty to suppress certain forms of conduct or expression that were gratuitously offensive to others and profane in cases where the impugned statements not only offended or shocked or expressed a provocative opinion but had also been considered an abusive attack on a religious group for example an abusive attack on the prophet of islam as in the applicant s case a criminal conviction might be necessary to protect the freedom of religion of others where a conviction was based on article of the criminal code the principles developed under article and of the convention had to be considered when examining whether a statement was capable of arousing justified indignation a statement could not be considered as arousing indignation if it was compatible with articles and of the convention the courts therefore had to examine the meaning of the impugned statement as well as the context in which it had been made and whether the statement was based on fact or was a value judgment only by considering all of those points could the question of the ability to arouse justified indignation be examined applying the above considerations to the applicant s case the supreme court held that she had not aimed to contribute to a serious debate about islam or the phenomenon of child marriage but merely to defame muhammad by accusing him of a specific sexual preference based on the assumption that he had had sexual intercourse with a prepubescent child in order to show that he was not a worthy subject of worship the court whilst not misjudging the importance of the debate about sexual contact between adults and children found that the applicant had not contributed to a debate of general interest because she had made her allegation primarily in order to defame muhammad on the basis of the regional court s findings that the applicant s statements qualified as value judgments the supreme court held that they had not been a contribution to a serious debate the case had to be distinguished from the case of aydın tatlav cited above in which a scientific book published in its fifth edition had contained a passage of harsh criticism of religion which had not been offensive in the present case the criminal conviction constituted a measure necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of article of the convention moreover the measure taken by the criminal court had also been proportionate as the applicant had only been ordered to pay a fine of eur the supreme court therefore dismissed the applicant s request for a renewal of the proceedings the supreme court s judgment was served on the applicant s counsel on january article of the criminal code is part of section of the criminal code which inter alia lists criminally punishable offences against religious peace strafbare handlungen gegen den religiösen frieden it reads as follows whoever in circumstances where his or her behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation publicly disparages or insults a person who or an object which is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country or a dogma a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community shall be liable to up to six months imprisonment or a day-fine for a period of up to days. article of the criminal code as in force at the relevant time read as follows whoever in a manner capable of endangering public order publicly incites to commit a hostile act against a church or religious community established within the country or against a group defined by its belonging to such a church or religious community a race a nation a tribe or a state shall be liable to up to two years imprisonment similarly whoever publicly incites against a group defined in paragraph or tries to insult or disparage it in a manner violating human dignity shall equally be held liable. article of the united nations international covenant on civil and political rights provides any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. the council of europe parliamentary assembly stated in its recommendation on blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on grounds of their religion with regard to blasphemy religious insults and hate speech against persons on the grounds of their religion the state is responsible for determining what should count as criminal offences within the limits imposed by the case law of the european court of human rights in this connection the assembly considers that blasphemy as an insult to a religion should not be deemed a criminal offence a distinction should be made between matters relating to moral conscience and those relating to what is lawful matters which belong to the public domain and those which belong to the private sphere even though today prosecutions in this respect are rare in member states they are legion in other countries of the world the assembly notes that member states have the obligation under article of the convention to protect freedom of religion including the freedom to manifest one s religion this requires that member states protect such manifestations against disturbances by others however these rights may sometimes be subject to certain justified limitations the challenge facing the authorities is how to strike a fair balance between the interests of individuals as members of a religious community in ensuring respect for their right to manifest their religion or their right to education and the general public interest or the rights and interests of others the assembly considers that as far as it is necessary in a democratic society in accordance with article paragraph of the convention national law should only penalise expressions about religious matters which intentionally and severely disturb public order and call for public violence the european commission for democracy through law the venice commission stated in its report on the relationship between freedom of expression and freedom of religion the issue of regulation and prosecution of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred cdl-ad as concerns the question of whether or not there is a need for specific supplementary legislation in the area of blasphemy religious insult and incitement to religious hatred the commission finds a that incitement to hatred including religious hatred should be the object of criminal sanctions as is the case in almost all european states b that it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an offence of religious insult that is insult to religious feelings simpliciter without the element of incitement to hatred as an essential component c that the offence of blasphemy should be abolished which is already the case in most european states and should not be reintroduced as concerns the question of to what extent criminal legislation is adequate and/or effective for the purpose of bringing about the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for one s beliefs the commission reiterates that in its view criminal sanctions are only appropriate in respect of incitement to hatred unless public order offences are appropriate notwithstanding the difficulties with enforcement of criminal legislation in this area there is a high symbolic value in the pan-european introduction of criminal sanctions against incitement to hatred it gives strong signals to all parts of society and to all societies that an effective democracy can not bear behaviours and acts which undermine its core values pluralism tolerance respect for human rights and nondiscrimination it is essential however that the application of legislation against incitement to hatred be done in a non-discriminatory manner in the commission s view instead criminal sanctions are inappropriate in respect of insult to religious feelings and even more so in respect of blasphemy. the united nations human rights council stated in its resolution combating intolerance negative stereotyping and stigmatization of and discrimination incitement to violence and violence against persons based on religion or belief adopted on march the human rights council expresses its concern that incidents of religious intolerance discrimination and related violence as well as of negative stereotyping of individuals on the basis of religion or belief continue to rise around the world and condemns in this context any advocacy of religious hatred against individuals that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence and urges states to take effective measures as set forth in the present resolution consistent with their obligations under international human rights law to address and combat such incidents notes the speech given by secretary-general of the organization of the islamic conference at the fifteenth session of the human rights council and draws on his call on states to take the following actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance peace and respect by e speaking out against intolerance including advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence f adopting measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief g understanding the need to combat denigration and negative religious stereotyping of persons as well as incitement to religious hatred by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local national regional and international levels through inter alia education and awareness-building h recognizing that the open constructive and respectful debate of ideas as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue at the local national and international levels can play a positive role in combating religious hatred incitement and violence the un human rights committee adopted at its session july the general comment no on freedom of opinion and freedom of expression freedom of expression is a necessary condition for the realization of the principles of transparency and accountability that are in turn essential for the promotion and protection of human rights defamation laws must be crafted with care to ensure that they comply with paragraph and that they do not serve in practice to stifle freedom of expression all such laws in particular penal defamation laws should include such defences as the defence of truth and they should not be applied with regard to those forms of expression that are not of their nature subject to verification at least with regard to comments about public figures consideration should be given to avoiding penalizing or otherwise rendering unlawful untrue statements that have been published in error but without malice in any event a public interest in the subject matter of the criticism should be recognized as a defence care should be taken by states parties to avoid excessively punitive measures and penalties where relevant states parties should place reasonable limits on the requirement for a defendant to reimburse the expenses of the successful party states parties should consider the decriminalization of defamation and in any case the application of the criminal law should only be countenanced in the most serious of cases and imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty it is impermissible for a state party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously such a practice has a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system including blasphemy laws are incompatible with the covenant except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article paragraph of the covenant thus for instance it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favour of or against one or certain religions or belief systems or their adherents over another or religious believers over non-believers nor would it be permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the covenant imposes on states parties in relation to the respect for freedom of opinion and expression the covenant does not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events restrictions on the right of freedom of opinion should never be imposed and with regard to freedom of expression they should not go beyond what is permitted in paragraph or required under article the european parliament in its resolution of february on the situation of fundamental rights in the european union ini held that the european parliament recalls that national laws that criminalise blasphemy restrict freedom of expression concerning religious or other beliefs that they are often applied to persecute mistreat or intimidate persons belonging to religious or other minorities and that they can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief recommends that the member states decriminalise such offences,case originated application republic austria lodged court article convention

the case originated in an application no against the republic of poland lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a polish national mr andrzej zybertowicz the applicant on august the applicant was represented by mr g. górski a lawyer practising in toruń the polish government the government were represented by their agent mrs j. chrzanowska from the ministry of foreign affairs the applicant alleged that his right to freedom of expression had been breached in violation of article of the convention on september this complaint was communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in toruń he is a publicist and a professor of sociology on march the applicant was interviewed on the telephone by m.z. a journalist from rzeczpospolita a national daily newspaper on the subject of lustration of journalists which at that time was widely commented on in the media the transcript of that interview was sent to the applicant by email the applicant sent the text back with some minor corrections on march the newspaper published the applicant s opinion it was titled journalists under autohypnosis żurnalisci pod wplywem autohipnozy and included the following paragraph some people easily reach for personal arguments the gazeta wyborcza journalist s.b. in a conversation with me stated professor zybertowicz speaks now although during the communist times he was quiet this is classic a.m. repeatedly said i spent so many years in prison so now i am right unfortunately moral integrity in one situation does not automatically indicate a complete cognitive judgment in another situation. niektórzy z łatwością sięgają w niej po argumenty personalne dziennikarz „ gazety wyborczej s.b w dyskusji ze mna oznajmił prof. zybertowicz teraz zabiera glos choć za komuny siedział cicho to już klasyka a.m. wielokrotnie powtarzał ja tyle lat siedziałem w więzieniu to teraz mam racje niestety z ewentualnej prawości moralnej w jednej sytuacji nie wynika automatycznie zdolność do kompletnej oceny poznawczej w innej the text was published in a column ‘ polemic/discussion/analysis on and march a legal representative of a.m. an editor-in chief of gazeta wyborcza one of the biggest daily newspapers sent a legal letter to the applicant offering to settle the issue amicably provided that the applicant published a relevant apology he referred to the phrase this is classic a.m. repeatedly said i spent so many years in prison so now i am right the applicant refused the request and published the letter in rzeczpospolita on april on april a.m. brought a civil action in the warsaw regional court sąd okręgowy requesting legal protection of his personal rights he requested that the applicant be ordered to publish an apology and to pay damages of polish zlotys pln approximately euros eur to a charity on december the warsaw regional court allowed the plaintiff s claim it ordered the applicant to publish an apology on the first second or third page of rzeczpospolita for publishing untrue information it further determined the exact length of the apology not smaller than x cm and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur to a charity and pln approximately eur in court fees during the proceedings the court questioned the applicant the plaintiff and the journalist m.z the court did not take into consideration two private expert opinions on language analysis provided by the applicant and a.m the court further stressed that while the parties representatives had questioned these opinions they had not asked for a court-appointed expert on linguistics nor requested that their experts be heard by the court as witnesses the court did not find any basis to appoint an expert of its own motion the warsaw regional court considered that the phrase a.m repeatedly said i spent so many years in prison so now i am right was a statement of fact given that it was a phrase allegedly used many times by a.m however it had not been proved that a.m. had ever used the above words the applicant claimed before the court that the phrase used in the interview was an acceptable journalistic summary of a.m. s opinions and his set of views demonstrated during numerous public appearances according to the applicant it was possible to summarise one s way of thinking he further confirmed that he was not aware of any public speech given by a.m. which included the phrase in question however the phrase was not a direct quote since it was not in quotation marks it was a reconstruction interpretation and paraphrase demonstrating a.m. s mindset he submitted examples of numerous public statements made by a.m. between and in which a.m. had referred to his stay in prison during the communist-era the court considered that even though the phrase was not in quotation marks it was a direct quote since there was a colon thus a.m repeatedly said the court referred to the polish language dictionary of according to which a colon was used in particular to introduce direct quotations such as in the present case since a.m. had never used these exact words this information was untrue and had breached his personal rights the court further went on to examine whether the statement could have been treated as an acceptable paraphrase and considered referring to the same polish dictionary that it was not possible to paraphrase a set of moral views in conclusion the court held that a.m. s personal rights had been breached because the applicant had failed to prove that he was acting within the existing legal order on the applicant s appeal on october the warsaw court of appeal sąd apelacyjny upheld the first-instance judgment and ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur in court fees for the proceedings before the second-instance court the court agreed with the reasoning presented by the regional court it considered that the use of the colon as in a.m repeatedly said would indicate the factual nature of the phrase this view was made with reference to general knowledge and did not need any special information it further held that this phrase could not be considered to be a paraphrase however as no expert opinion on linguistics was obtained further reflections on this issue were pointless the court further examined numerous quotes from a.m. s public appearances and established that in none of those statements a.m. had used the exact phrase attributed to him consequently the court considered that the phrase used by the applicant had breached the plaintiff s personal rights in particular his credibility reputation and good name showing him as petty-minded in view of the plaintiff s professional situation it impeded him from practising his profession and damaged his position as editor-in-chief of one of the biggest daily newspapers the applicant lodged a cassation appeal in particular he referred to article of the convention and pointed out that the court of appeal had failed to obtain an expert opinion on linguistics on february the supreme court sąd najwyższy dismissed the applicant s appeal the court referred to the reasons given by the lower courts it further confirmed that while under article of the civil procedure code ccp a court might obtain evidence of its own motion such situations were exceptional in the present case it had not been necessary to order an opinion from an expert on linguistics as correctly noted by the court of appeal the decisive factor for interpretation was the understanding of an average reader the newspaper rzeczpospolita was addressed to a wide group of recipients and therefore these articles should have been interpreted according to widely acceptable interpretation rules lastly the court explained that the phrase in question had not ceased to be informative with reference to the personality of the parties furthermore it could not have been perceived differently because it had been made in the context of a public debate on lustration of journalists the way an article was perceived depended on the choice of words rather than its political context or publication in a particular column the supreme court also ordered the applicant to pay pln approximately eur in court fees for the appeal proceedings the applicant paid pln approximately eur to a charity in october at the same time he also arranged for the publication of an apology in rzeczpospolita for which he paid pln approximately eur during the proceedings against the applicant several thousand people signed a letter titled ‘ defending freedom of expression which was handed to the ombudsman on november they argued that a publicist had a right to express this type of opinion about other participants in a public debate in reply on november a group of polish intellectuals published a letter titled ‘ against lies in which they stressed that freedom of expression had limits in particular the other person s right to dignity and good name therefore in their opinion spreading untrue information was not protected by any law article of the civil code contains a non-exhaustive list of rights known as personal rights dobra osobiste this provision states the personal rights of an individual such as health liberty reputation cześć freedom of conscience name or pseudonym image secrecy of correspondence inviolability of the home scientific or artistic work as well as inventions and improvements shall be protected under civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions. article of the civil code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights under that provision a person faced with the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity unless it is not unlawful where an infringement has taken place the person affected may inter alia request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form or demand satisfaction from him or her if an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss the person concerned may seek damages under article of the civil code a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation the relevant part of that provision reads the court may grant a suitable sum as pecuniary compensation for non-pecuniary damage krzywda suffered by anyone whose personal rights have been infringed alternatively without prejudice to the right to seek any other relief that may be necessary to remove the consequences of the infringement the person concerned may ask the court to award a suitable sum for the benefit of a specific social interest pursuant to article of the civil procedure code the parties are obliged to submit evidence necessary

fundamental freedoms the convention by a polish national mrs izabela malisiewicz-gąsior the applicant on october the polish government the government were represented by their agents mr k. drzewicki and subsequently mr. j. wołąsiewicz of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicant alleged that the right of freedom of expression was violated in her case the application was allocated to the first section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule by a decision of january the court declared the application admissible the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits rule the chamber having decided after consulting the parties that no hearing on the merits was required rule in fine the applicant was born in born in she is a choreographer and lives in łódź the prosecution of the applicant on charges of kidnapping on june at p.m. mr andrzej kern at that time the deputy speaker of the sejm made a formal notification of the commission of an offence zawiadomienie o popełnieniu przestępstwa to the łódź regional prosecutor e.s. alleging that the applicant and her husband had kidnapped his daughter m.k the applicant submitted that the allegation was false as m.k had in fact run away from home and had only been accompanied by the applicant s son who had been her boyfriend for a long time m.k had previously run away from home on several occasions because of conflicts with her parents prosecutor e.s. who according to the applicant was a friend of mr kern immediately instructed the łódź deputy regional prosecutor e.c to take charge of the case on the same day i.e june the prosecutor e.c signed a warrant authorising the search of the applicant s flat the warrant was intended to search the flat for m.k and for drugs on june prosecutor e.c signed an order allowing the tapping of the applicant s telephone on june at a.m. the applicant s husband went to his cottage situated in the suburbs of łódź he was arrested by police officers who then searched the cottage prosecutor e.s and mr kern were present at the scene subsequently the applicant s husband was taken to the łódź regional police station where he was detained overnight on june at a.m. police officers searched the applicant s flat in her presence however they did not find either m.k or drugs the police officers advised the applicant that her husband had been detained and served her with a summons to report on the same day at noon to the regional police station for questioning in the morning of june the applicant s husband was taken handcuffed to the premises of the regional prosecution service he was questioned by prosecutors e.s and e.c mr kern was present during the questioning the applicant s husband was released after the questioning the applicant failed to report for questioning on june she submitted to the police a letter explaining that she had to care for her daughter who was ill subsequently the applicant failed to report for questioning on and june on and june police officers tried to serve a summons on the applicant but could not find her at her place of residence on june prosecutor e.c charged the applicant with kidnapping and signed an arrest warrant for her prosecutor e.c also charged the applicant s son with kidnapping on june the applicant was taken into custody she was detained in the łódź prison hospital apparently in the psychiatric ward on and july the applicant was questioned by prosecutor e.c she was also confronted with mr kern in the afternoon of july the applicant was released from detention on june the applicant applied for a transfer of her case to a prosecutor who worked outside the łódź region on august the ministry of justice advised her that the application had been allowed and that her case had been taken over by the poznań regional prosecutor r.g on september prosecutor r.g decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant and her son he considered that they had not kidnapped m.k the prosecutor referred to the statement taken from m.k who testified that it had been her decision to run away from home and that she had asked the applicant s son to accompany her mr kern and his wife lodged appeals against the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant and her son but on february prosecutor b.m of the ministry of justice dismissed them the prosecutor considered that the allegations of kidnapping were groundless the case concerning the alleged kidnapping of m.k received wide coverage in the media in the applicant stood as an independent candidate in the parliamentary elections on august she published an article in the weekly newspaper angora the first half of the article which was published in a section entitled preelection pranks read as follows why i am an independent candidate for the senate not connected to any ‘ networks relations or obligations the fact that i am described in the press and television as ‘ a mother-in-law of m. k. probably shows that the authors can not mention names since they use such a euphemism it is not my achievement and it was not a result of my efforts that we have become a family with mr kern it can be explained by my son and his wife if it is important in order to explain the origin of the idea of standing in the elections to the senate i have to go back to the events which took place a year ago at that time i learned at my cost what the abuse of power meant the deputy speaker of the sejm at that time directed by emotions and personal animosities made the persons responsible for respecting the law the regional prosecutor and his deputy and even the minister of justice breach the law because of ‘ the solidarity of colleagues i was arrested detained in a psychiatric cell my flat was provocatively searched for ‘ drugs my telephone calls were tapped a car damaged after such compromising events a politician of such a calibre in the west would have had to leave but here he still felt good and the sejm decided not to dismiss him i can imagine what sort of arrangements must have existed in the sejm to make such a decision i was so shocked by this that i was ready to go abroad as nothing could be changed a turning point came when the president dissolved the parliament people started to telephone and write letters asking me to stand in the elections they were saying that the events which had taken place a year ago showed that i could fight i am convinced that i am not the only one touched by the breaches of the law committed by the representatives of ‘ the new democracy however the law is the same for everybody regardless of whether somebody is in power or is ‘ an ordinary man this fundamental rule of democracy must be respected the second half of the article described the applicant s ideas about working in the senate on september the applicant published in the same weekly the following article about me the first years of my professional life were dedicated to art as a dancer and a choreographer i worked with numerous theatres and cultural centres both in among others the łódź grand theatre and abroad i also worked as a pedagogue with children and young people in i started to run a private business and presently i am a co-owner of a company ‘ avatar i have two children a old son and a old daughter my husband jan is an actor i did not belong to any political party i did not participate actively in politics in the summer of events took place which changed my attitude to the world the abuse of authority which i experienced has made it impossible for me to stand idly on the sideline and watch people who should be the guardians of the law breaking it ruthlessly for the sake of their private interests after all precisely that was done to me by the former deputy speaker of the sejm the former minister of justice the former regional prosecutor and his former deputy it is not by chance that today for some malicious people it is not important that i am an independent candidate for the senate but only that i can be called the mother-in-law of m. k. in bold in original they are not interested in the fact that a year ago i was arrested groundlessly and imprisoned purposely in a psychiatric cell that my home was searched on the pretext of ‘ looking for drugs that after my release i was followed my telephone calls were tapped and my car damaged causing me constant mental pressure all this happened in a country in which a westernstyle democracy had just set in today the vice minister of justice sees ‘ clear pressure brought by the deputy speaker kern on the łódź prosecution service and there are criminal proceedings pending against its former employees i am a strong person i have endured however i do not want any other innocent person to suffer similar harassment there must be justice and equality before the law regardless of whether somebody is ‘ the man in the street or the deputy speaker of the sejm i know that i can fight and win i have remained independent that is why i have decided to enter the political arena in bold in original in election broadcasts on the łódź local radio station on and september the applicant made the following statement a turning-point came last year you remember that story it was well-known in the whole of although i did not cause it at that time i realised to my cost what the abuse of power meant the deputy speaker of the sejm at that time directed by emotions made the regional prosecutor his deputy and even the minister of justice breach the law because of the solidarity of colleagues i was arrested detained in a psychiatric cell my flat was provocatively searched for drugs my telephone calls were tapped a car damaged all this because the daughter of mister deputy speaker decided to spend holidays with my son without her daddy s permission until then i had thought that such behaviour had been possible only in the stalinist era. in election broadcasts on the łódź local television station on and september the applicant made the following statement the abuse of authority which i experienced has made it impossible for me to stand on the sideline and idly watch people who should be the guardians of the law breaking it ruthlessly for the sake of their private interests precisely that was done to me by the former deputy speaker of the sejm the former regional prosecutor and his deputy today there are criminal proceedings pending against them i am a strong enduring person however i do not want any other innocent person to suffer similar harassment. the prosecution on charges of defamation on september mr kern lodged with the łódź district court a private bill of indictment he charged the applicant with seven counts of defamation zniesławienie under article of the criminal code in particular mr kern alleged that the applicant had published the above articles and had broadcast the above election statements in order to debase in the public opinion the deputy speaker andrzej kern and to expose him to loss of the trust necessary to perform his public and political functions. the applicant was tried by the skierniewice district court between may and march on march she was convicted for having made on television radio and in the press between august and september statements that mr kern directed by emotions made the regional prosecutor his deputy and even the minister of justice breach the law because of the solidarity of colleagues and that today there are criminal proceedings pending against him the trial court considered that her publications and statements constituted a single continuous offence of defamation by making the above statements the applicant defamed andrzej kern and made untrue allegations which could have debased the victim in the public opinion and exposed him to loss of the trust necessary to perform the functions of deputy speaker of the sejm of the republic of poland and other public functions as well as to work as a lawyeradvocate as regards the first statement that mr kern directed by emotions made the regional prosecutor his deputy and even the minister of justice breach the law because of the solidarity of colleagues the trial court considered that even though mr kern personally made a formal notification of the commission of an offence to the prosecutor e.c. nevertheless the prosecutors e.s and e.c acted independently when they made their decisions concerning the applicant s case the court noted that it was the right of every citizen to lodge a request to prosecute somebody and therefore the applicant s statement that it constituted a breach of law for the private interest had been untrue the court then examined the merits of the applicant s allegations that she had been arrested detained in a psychiatric cell her flat was provocatively searched for drugs telephone calls were tapped a car damaged. the district court established that warrants given by the prosecutor to arrest her search her flat and tap her telephone calls were given in accordance with the law however it acknowledged that the prosecutor should have considered other preventive measures then arrest in order to interrogate the applicant in sum the court found as unsubstantiated the allegation that mr kern suggested ordered or in other manner made the prosecutor to give decision to detain the applicant on remand with respect to the statement broadcast on and september the court observed that between august and september there were no criminal proceedings pending against andrzej kern in fact the criminal proceedings against him were initiated only on december on that date he was charged with having committed against m. k. a crime described in article of the criminal code the victim filed written information about that crime on october the trial court concluded that there was no evidence that while the applicant made the statements in question she had a belief based on a wellfounded basis that the allegations were true and that she was defending a socially justified interest the applicant appealed to the against her conviction on november the court gave a judgment in which it upheld her conviction but changed the sentence the applicant s prison term was lowered to one year suspended for three years she was ordered to pay for the publication of the judgment in one national daily and the announcement containing her apologies in the weekly angora moreover the applicant was ordered to reimburse the private prosecutor pln for the costs of the appellate proceedings and to pay a pln fee to the state treasury the appellate court considered that the trial court s assessment of facts and legal reasoning were correct the court stressed that in order to find that there was no office of defamation all three conditions set out in article must be fulfilled jointly it further stated turning to the instant case it should be considered that even if the applicant proved that her statements directed against mr kern were true or that she had a belief based on a well-founded basis that the allegations were true that in any event would not justify the trial court to apply article the firstinstance court rightly found that the action of i. malisiewicz-gąsior directed against a. kern was an element of her election campaign aiming at ‘ promoting her own person in order to obtain a positive election result therefore the applicant could not be said to have been defending a socially justified interest as she had been trying to achieve her private objective nevertheless the found that the sentence imposed on the applicant by the trial court was too harsh in this connection the court established as follows the appellate court considers that in deciding the severity of the criminal measures against the applicant her particular psychological situation since the beginning of all criminal proceedings against her should have been taken into consideration it is beyond doubt that she could have subjectively felt that the prosecuting authorities had been overactive which was not without influence on her being able to control her emotions and on her motivations. the applicant could not afford to hire a lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal and therefore she applied to the minister of justice and the ombudsman to lodge a cassation appeal against her conviction on december the ombudsman allowed her application and filed with the supreme court a cassation appeal against the judgment of the the ombudsman submitted that the courts had failed to take into account evidence pointing to the fact that the inadequacy of the actions of the police and the prosecution service in respect of herself and her family in the case concerning the kidnapping of m. k. could have led the applicant to the justified belief that her allegations concerning mr kern had been true and that she had been ‘ defending a socially justified interest in this connection the ombudsman stated in his appeal that furthermore the courts view that the defendant was not defending a socially justified interest because she was participating in her own election campaign and aiming in the first place to achieve her own private objective is not supported by the evidence which was collected and disclosed at the hearing the participation in one s own election campaign can not be an obstacle to speaking on the subject of ensuring respect for the law by institutions and public personalities what is more an election campaign invariably constitutes a period of public statements on important social issues which certainly include the respect for the law especially by institutions and persons especially obliged to do so it is therefore difficult to consider that it was the defendant s intention to promote herself and not by using the opportunity to speak publicly pointing on the basis of her own experience to the danger of breaking the law by a public institution as a result of yielding to the pressure of public personalities. the ombudsman further submitted that prosecutors e.s and e.c had broken the law he relied on the files on the disciplinary proceedings taken against both prosecutors finally the ombudsman challenged the courts assessment of part of the evidence on december the criminal section of the supreme court dismissed the cassation appeal its reasoning ended with the following conclusion the irresistible conclusion is that the submissions made in the cassation appeal formally of a procedural nature concern in fact the allegation of an error in the assessment of facts taken as the basis for the decision and the assessment of evidence which is not allowed in cassation proceedings cassation proceedings can not be transformed into third-instance proceedings dedicated to further consideration of all aspects of the submissions made in the appeal which have already been analysed by the appellate court in the meantime on august and september the skierniewice district court held hearings on the enforcement of the applicant s prison sentence as she had failed to apologise to mr kern the applicant did not attend the hearings on october the skierniewice district court decided not to enforce the suspended prison sentence imposed on the applicant article of the criminal code read as follows anyone who imputes to another person a group of persons or an institution such behaviour or characteristics which may debase them in the public opinion or expose to loss of the trust necessary for a certain position occupation or a type of activity shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding years a restriction of liberty or a fine anyone who raises or makes public untrue allegation about behaviour or characteristics of another person a group of persons or institutions in order to debase them in the public opinion or expose to loss of the trust necessary for a certain position occupation or a type of activity shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding years the prosecution takes place under a private bill of indictment. pursuant to article there is no offence described in article if an allegation made publicly is true and the offender acts in the defence of a socially justified interest or has a belief based on a well-founded basis that he is defending such an interest or the offender makes an allegation publicly and has a belief based on a wellfounded basis that the allegation is true and that he is defending a socially justified interest non-existence of an offence resulting from the reasons described in and does not exclude the offender s liability for defamation because of the form in which an allegation was made or made public,case originated application lodged european commission human rights

the case originated in an application no against the republic of cyprus lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by alithia publishing company ltd a company registered in cyprus and mr alecos constantinides a cypriot national the applicants on may the applicants were represented by mr c. pourgourides and mr a. demetriades lawyers practising in limassol and respectively the cypriot government the government were represented by their agent mr p. clerides attorney-general of the the applicants alleged in particular that the defamation proceedings brought against them had given rise to violations of their rights to freedom of thought under article of the convention and to freedom of expression under article by a decision of january the court gave notice of the complaint concerning article of the convention to the government it also decided under article of the convention to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility mr l. loucaides the judge elected in respect of withdrew from sitting in the case rule of the rules of court and the government accordingly appointed mr m. nicolatos to sit as an ad hoc judge rule in their letter of november the applicants requested an oral hearing on the admissibility and merits of the case on the date of the adoption of the present judgment the court decided that a hearing would not be necessary rule in fine the first applicant alithia publishing company ltd is registered under cypriot law and is the publisher of the daily morning newspaper alithia the second applicant alecos costantinides is the editor-in-chief of alithia he was born in and lives in between december and january the first applicant published a series of twelve articles written by the second applicant these articles concerned the conduct of mr aloneftis who at the relevant time was minister of defence of the the articles claimed that he had been involved in a conspiracy with armaments traders for the misappropriation of public funds according to the applicants mr aloneftis acting on behalf of the government was in the habit of accepting more expensive armaments contracts in return for generous commissions from certain armament traders it was alleged that he used these commissions to fund his gambling habit in casinos it was further reported that mr aloneftis while betting in casinos in the company of his friends the armaments traders would discuss classified information concerning the republic s armament programme and that this was how such information had been divulged to the international press it was also claimed that he had instigated a bomb attack against the second applicant in particular in an article of january written by the second applicant the newspaper revealed that the republic of cyprus had purchased a french armament system which was effectively useless given that the did not possess the equipment that was necessary to maintain it it was claimed that various officials had received commissions of at least million cypriot pounds cyp in respect of this purchase the president of the republic and the minister of defence amongst others were well aware of the identity of the beneficiaries but journalists daring to investigate in such matters should be very careful a second article published on the same date and entitled people in hiding a reply to an anonymous article by mr aloneftis minister of defence the second applicant expressed his concern about the fact that the minister of defence who was certainly aware of the individuals who were receiving commissions from the purchase of armaments did not denounce them to the relevant authorities it read such questions should be addressed to mr aloneftis who is a connoisseur of casinos it was added that should the attorney-general wish to proceed with a criminal investigation into these matters he should start with the acts of those who are gambling in casinos laughing at us while we the fools are required to pay for their chips a subsequent article by the second applicant dated january and entitled the attorney-general and the clowns μασκαράδες stated that the minister of defence mr aloneftis through an article in another cypriot newspaper had had the incredible nerve to request alithia to name the suppliers of armament systems who were paying commissions to state officials the article read as follows those names however were well known to everyone and firstly to the president of the republic and the minister of defence the latter regularly appears in casinos alongside the most important arms supplier and attends receptions given by another no one attends receptions given by people whom he does not know or embarks on cruises in the yachts of strangers the attorney-general should interfere where he ought to do so there are many clowns and crooks in this place who are beyond the reach of the short and crooked arm of the law. the closing paragraphs of the article read the last time that our paper covered the great feast hosted by defence officials the attorney-general had not been invited in fact certain hit men were employed to terrorise our newspaper and to a certain extent their attempt has been successful is a small country and everyone knows what is going on everyone is aware of the names that we were called on to reveal everyone knows about the casinos everyone knows about the bomb attack and the people who instigated it so the clowns μασκαράδες should stop acting in a provocative and hypocritical manner. in another article of january the second applicant stated according to information from a serious source at one stage an arms firm had offered us the tanks we did not accept the offer because the tanks had been offered for free had we agreed to take these tanks there would have been no commissions and then what would happen to the casinos a further article by the second applicant dated january and entitled aloneftis s newspaper casinos and missiles stated a cypriot newspaper to which the minister of defence mr aloneftis is transmitting poppycock σπερμολογίες literally spermologies against the newspaper alithia published the following in its edition of january ‘ recent publications appearing on a daily basis for the few last weeks in a morning daily newspaper have prompted a threatening statement from the turkish prime minister suleiman demirel the turks were particularly worried by information published concerning the intention of the national armed forces to purchase exoset missiles. the above statement obviously concerns alithia and warrants a reply alithia has never stated anything concerning exoset missiles the reference to negotiations conducted by the for the purchase of exoset missiles was published in the foreign military journal defence news approximately one year ago and was mentioned in the newspaper cyprus mail some days ago on the contrary alithia merely stated that it would be foolish for the to buy such missiles which are primarily launched from airplanes that we do not possess the turks have therefore heard about the missiles from elsewhere and it is well known where defence news obtained its information when our ministers gamble in casinos together with various arms suppliers and become merry they start shouting about matters concerning missiles and rockets and everyone can hear them. a further short article of the same day was entitled casinologists and was accompanied by a picture of mr aloneftis it referred to an article in another cypriot newspaper reminding a well-known cypriot politician that the cypriot electoral body was not a casino in it added that there was no need to refer to casinos in las vegas since the casino maxim was closer in this respect the alithia article stated you should ask aloneftis and his team who will be in a position to confirm this of course aloneftis would not know how people exit from casinos in their underwear but he is well aware of how you get in there on january an article entitled call and ask why the minister of defence is entertaining himself with armament dealers stated mr clerides promotional film could invite taxpayers to call mr vasiliou president of the republic at the time and ask him why his minister of defence is having fun in restaurants alongside arms dealers why he is playing βanko punto with them in london casinos and why he always insists on purchasing everything from those particular arms dealers. another article of the same date called on the minister of defence to explain why cyprus had paid twice as much as for an identical armament system the minister was further called on to explain the exact nature of his relations with a french company involved in the armaments trade sofma a further article of the same date written by the second applicant and entitled casinos and panties read the minister of defence mr aloneftis is a regular in casinos the publisher of alithia said the following about him ‘ we saw him having fun in various night spots in alongside representatives of arms manufacturers we saw him cruising in their luxurious yachts we saw him gambling with them in casinos the reference to casinos .... is made in a literal sense and refers to the casino maxim where hundreds of thousands of pounds are at stake to the detriment of our defence when alithia first reported on the issue of enormous commissions being paid to state officials by arms dealers a year and a half ago it was targeted by nocturnal assailants as is very well known the orders behind this were issued from the casino in the meantime we took our measures and would like to warn such assailants who dare to speak about morality that we are not affected by their new threats .... on january the second applicant stated in an article entitled defence in and out the main interest of the minister of defence in recent years was not to improve the defence of cyprus but the purchase of excessively expensive systems from sofma at prices which at times were seven times the price of similar and indeed better systems his goal was to spend as much as possible for well-known reasons and not that of the ensuring an effective defence the defence of cyprus has accordingly been vested in the hands of a foreign company sofma while cyprus s defence policy is in reality being considered and developed at london s maxim where all decision-making is taking place the defence of in the hands of amateurs and sofma has become a lucky game like banco punto roulette or black jack and what we fools have not yet realised is that these people are gambling with our own money by originating summons of march mr aloneftis instituted civil proceedings for defamation before the district court of nicosia mr aloneftis requested compensation for defamation as well as a court order prohibiting further reporting of his conduct in a defamatory manner the trial took place before judge nathanael it lasted for months a period considered as extraordinary by the district court the defendants invited witnesses to give oral evidence and at least written exhibits and other pieces of documentary evidence were admitted the applicants accepted during the trial that the contested publications were defamatory toward the plaintiff in particular it was stated on their behalf that the publications were intensely defamatory toward the plaintiff and injured inter alia his integrity honesty reputation personality patriotism and good fame and caused serious injury and damage to his private social and public life nevertheless they argued that the publications were covered by the defence of justification and fair comment and constituted a legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression in this context they maintained that their allegations concerning mr aloneftis s conduct were true on november judge nathanael delivered the district court s judgment by virtue of which the applicants were found liable for defamation in relation to the defence of justification the district court noted that where this defence was raised the burden of proof fell on the defendant to show the accuracy of the facts referred to in a publication should the defendant fail to discharge it then this defence would fail even in cases where a defendant honestly and reasonably believed that the relevant statements were true it was noted that the defence of fair comment applied when a published statement constituted a fair and reasonable comment on a matter of public interest the comment had to be made on the basis of facts that were set out correctly and without malice the defendant would bear the burden of proof in showing that the facts on which the comment was based were true and that the comment could be justified as one that could have been made by a reasonable man if the defendant succeeded in establishing the fairness of the comment then the burden would shift to the plaintiff who would have to show the existence of malice on the part of the defendant judge nathanael added that there would be a further limitation when a comment concerned a person holding a public post and imputed to him immoral dishonest or corrupt behaviour in which case a defendant would have to show the truth of his allegations. the testimony of the first applicant s director and the second applicant demonstrated that they had had no evidence or other sources in support of their allegations at the time of publication their positions were further undermined by the fact that the applicants had apologised to a certain armaments dealer for their defamatory allegation that he had been conspiring with mr aloneftis the second applicant had been found to be an unreliable and evasive witness his testimony demonstrated that there had been no research or other attempt to verify most of the allegations made in the impugned publications moreover the second applicant had been entirely contradictory as to whether any effort had been made to contact mr aloneftis prior to publication his evidence was rejected the evidence of the first applicant s director was also rejected his allegations had been found to be clearly unsubstantiated and showed his prejudice against mr aloneftis in relation to the award of damages judge nathanael took into account inter alia the seriousness of the defamatory allegations and the complete lack of evidence he also considered that the overall behaviour of the applicants at trial showed malice they had insisted on the truth of their defamatory publications and had pursued a defamatory campaign against the plaintiff by a series of clearly defamatory and unverified articles which continued to be published even while the proceedings were pending on this basis an award of cypriot pounds cyp equivalent to approximately euros eur was made as ordinary damages in addition to an award of cyp equivalent to approximately eur for exemplary damages on january the applicants lodged an appeal against the district court s judgment with the supreme court in their grounds of appeal they challenged inter alia the compatibility of cypriot defamation law as set out in the civil wrongs act cap see paragraph below with the right to freedom of speech as guaranteed in the constitution of the and the convention on november the president of the supreme court pikis delivered the supreme court s majority judgment which upheld the district court s judgment and the corresponding award of damages it was noted that the applicants had stated in their statement of defence filed with the district court that the publication of the impugned articles amounted to an exercise of their right to freedom of expression and as such should have been protected on this basis they argued before the supreme court that they had explicitly raised the defence of qualified privilege in their defence statement and that their plea had been ignored by the first-instance court the majority found that given that the applicants had not properly raised this defence in their pleadings the first-instance court had been correct not to examine it there had been no evidence presented in court supporting the applicants allegations and the lack of such evidence was even admitted by the second applicant and the first applicant s director the latter s testimony had been rejected as unreliable despite the lack of supporting evidence the applicants had not presented their serious allegations to mr aloneftis prior to publication which was indicative of their motives and their indifference as to the truth of the facts presented and discussed in the articles the articles not only imputed to mr aloneftis the commission of criminal offences but had disparaged his moral character by presenting him as an unscrupulous criminal driven purely by self-interest the lack of supporting evidence and the seriousness of the defamatory allegations demonstrated the existence of malice on the part of the applicants as well as their intent to defame the plaintiff it was observed that the defence of qualified privilege was based on the duty to transmit information correlated by the right to receive such information its establishment depended on a number of factors concerning the nature of the information in issue the extent of any public interest in the matter the sources of such information the measures taken to verify the facts and whether the plaintiff had been requested to comment on the allegations made in the publication the protection of freedom of expression entailed that the courts should not easily reach the conclusion of lack of public interest over the subject-matter of a publication in cases of doubt freedom of expression should be favoured the majority thus endorsed the house of lords leading judgment in reynolds v. times newspapers ac at however it was considered that even assuming that the defence of qualified privilege had been properly raised in the light of the circumstances of this case it would not have succeeded defamation as a tort predated the enactment of the constitution and it had therefore to be examined whether the provisions of cap concerning an action in defamation were compatible with article of the constitution protecting the right to freedom of expression see paragraph below cap constituted a justified limitation on the right to freedom of expression since its provisions aimed to protect the reputation of another the limits on freedom of expression had to be directly connected with the aim that rendered them legitimate and the necessity requiring the protection of that aim whenever there appeared to be conflict between two rights the courts should take into account in their balancing exercise that fundamental rights were of equal importance reputation was considered to be an integral and important part of the dignity of an individual which once besmirched by unfounded allegations could be damaged forever its protection was vital for the protection of the rights of individuals and was in the public interest hence the provisions of cap did not run counter to the constitutional protection of freedom of expression the defence of justification ensured the essence of the right to freedom of expression however it was conditional on the existence of good faith on the part of a defendant in defamation proceedings in the present case the facts on which the publications had been based were inaccurate and the defendants had acted in flagrant disregard of the requirement to verify the factual allegations they had published mr justice hadjihambis delivered a dissenting opinion he considered that the defence of qualified privilege had been raised properly by the applicants in their pleadings since they had added therein that the action was contrary to their free speech rights section of explicitly referred to the defence of qualified privilege in setting out the balance that must be struck between freedom of expression and the right to reputation under this provision a publication would be privileged only if it was made bona fide and did not exceed what would be reasonable under the circumstances in his view given that the first-instance court had not considered the relevant defence the supreme court should have ordered a re-trial of the case in so far as relevant article of the constitution of the republic provides every person has the right to freedom of speech and expression in any form this right includes freedom to hold opinions and receive and impart information and ideas without interference by any public authority and regardless of frontiers the exercise of the rights provided in paragraphs and of this article may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary only in the interests of the security of the republic or the constitutional order public safety public order public health public morals or for the protection of the reputation or rights of others or for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. the civil wrongs act cap sets out the law of defamation in so far as relevant section provides a person publishes defamatory matter if he causes the printing writing painting effigy gesturing spoken words or other sounds or other means by which the defamatory matter is conveyed to be dealt with either by exhibition reading recitation description delivery communication distribution demonstration expression or utterance or otherwise so that the defamatory meaning thereof becomes known. the defences available in an action for defamation are set out in section of the civil wrongs act which in so far as relevant provides in an action for defamation it shall be a defence a that the matter concerning which the complaint was made was true provided that where the defamatory matter contains two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff a defence under this paragraph shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the defamatory matter not proved to be true does not materially injure the plaintiff s reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges b that the matter of which complaint was made was a fair comment on some matter of public interest provided that where the defamatory matter consists partly of allegations of fact and partly of expression of opinion a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the expression of opinion is a fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the defamatory matter complained of as are proved provided further that a defence under this paragraph shall not succeed if the plaintiff proves that the publication was not made in good faith within the meaning of subsection of section of this act c that the publication of the defamatory matter was privileged under sections and of this act d that the defamation was unintentional under section of this act. section addresses the situation where a publication of defamatory matter is conditionally privileged in so far as relevant it provides the publication of defamatory matter is privileged on condition that it is published in good faith in any of the following cases namely a if the relation between the parties by and to whom the publication is made is such that the person publishing the matter is under a legal moral or social duty to publish it to the person to whom the publication is made and the last-mentioned person has a corresponding interest in receiving it or the person publishing the matter has a legitimate personal interest to be protected and the person to whom the publication is made is under a corresponding legal moral or social duty to protect that interest provided that the publication does not exceed either in extent or matter what is reasonably sufficient for the occasion. section provides the publication of defamatory matter shall not be deemed to have been made in good faith by a person within the meaning of subsection of this section if it is made to appear either- that the matter was untrue and that he did not believed it to be true or that the matter was untrue and that he published it without having taken reasonable care to ascertain whether it was true or false or that in publishing the matter he acted with intent to injure the person defamed to a substantially greater degree or substantially otherwise than was reasonably necessary for the interest of the public or for the protection of the private right or interest in respect of which he claims to be privileged. section provides in any action brought in respect of the publication of any defamatory matter if such publication might be privileged under the provisions of subsection of this section and the defence of privilege is raised the onus of proving that such publication was not made in good faith shall be upon the plaintiff,case originated

been invited to take part in the above-mentioned programme on the same day the course director wrote to the dean of the faculty informing him that the applicant had been invited to take part in a television programme in his letter he also expressed doubts as to whether there was a link between the applicant s specialist field and the subject of the programme and whether the applicant s invitation to take part in a personal capacity was in keeping with the university s principles on march the dean of the faculty informed the director of the translation course that it had been decided that the applicant s participation in the programme in question was not appropriate the applicant was informed of the dean s decision the same day on march the applicant nevertheless took part in the programme in istanbul in letters dated and april to the dean of the faculty the applicant asked why his participation in the broadcast of march had not been considered appropriate in spite of his past work on the subject covered by the programme he added that it would have harmed his professional standing and reputation for reliability if he had withdrawn from the programme at short notice when he had already agreed to take part he also maintained that he had been entitled to take part in the event citing his academic freedom in that regard in a letter to the applicant dated april the dean of the faculty replied that the applicant had not been entitled to take part in the event without the authorities permission he added that the director of the translation course had expressed misgivings as to whether the applicant was sufficiently familiar with the topic of the programme of march and that the view of the course director had been taken into account in the decision to refuse authorisation on saturday april the applicant took part in another programme in the same series following an international conference held in istanbul from to april which the dean of the faculty had authorised him to attend on april a disciplinary inquiry was opened concerning the applicant on the grounds that he had twice taken part in the programme in istanbul without the university s authorisation on june the commission of inquiry published its report it noted at the outset that the applicant had been authorised to take part in events outside his city of residence on twelve occasions during the academic year but that his request for authorisation concerning the programme of march had been refused in view of the opinion of the course director who considered that the topic of the programme was not directly linked to the applicant s specialist field as to the applicant s participation in the broadcast of april the commission noted that the dean of the faculty had authorised the applicant to attend an academic gathering to be held from to april in istanbul and that this authorisation had not covered april the commission considered in that regard that not even research professors should take part in programmes of this type without supervision or authorisation and that universities had to uphold academic ethics it went on to find that the applicant s participation in two television programmes in istanbul on march and april without authorisation from his university amounted to leaving his city of residence without authorisation an offence punishable under regulation g of the disciplinary regulations for managers lecturers and officials in higher education institutions the disciplinary regulations it therefore proposed by way of a penalty that the applicant s salary be reduced by one-eighth under regulation d of the above-mentioned regulations on july the dean of the faculty decided to reduce the applicant s salary by one-eighth for leaving his city of residence without authorisation an offence punishable under regulation g of the disciplinary regulations on july the applicant applied to the university vicechancellor for reconsideration of that decision and requested that the sanction be lifted on august the vice-chancellor decided to lift the sanction of a reduction in salary and to impose a less severe penalty on the applicant in the form of a reprimand under regulation of the disciplinary regulations on october the applicant applied for judicial review of that decision he referred to his academic freedom which he claimed was provided for in the constitution as justification for his participation in the television programme in question pointing out that the programme had been broadcast on a public-service channel he also argued that regulation g of the disciplinary regulations was liable to be wrongfully applied by managers and that the perimeter of a city no longer had the same significance in view of modern means of transport and communication lastly he argued that the programme of april had been a follow-up to the conference of to april which he had been authorised to attend and that the people invited to appear on the programme had been participants in the conference on may the adana administrative court the administrative court dismissed the applicant s application finding that the decision to penalise him had not been unlawful the court noted in that regard that it was beyond dispute that on march the applicant had left his city of residence despite the refusal of his request to take part in the television programme in question the court considered that the applicant s remaining arguments gave no reason to suppose that the decision to impose a sanction had been defective on august the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law he complained in particular that the administrative court s examination of his claims had been inadequate on october the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal and upheld the administrative court s judgment it found that the reasoning of the decision had been in conformity with the procedure and the law and that there were no grounds for quashing the decision additional section of the civil servants act law no of july entitled residence requirement read as follows prior to its repeal by law

europe on protecting academic freedom of expression read as follows in accordance with the magna charta universitatum the assembly reaffirms the right to academic freedom and university autonomy which comprises the following principles academic freedom in research and in training should guarantee freedom of expression and of action freedom to disseminate information and freedom to conduct research and distribute knowledge and truth without restriction the institutional autonomy of universities should be a manifestation of an independent commitment to the traditional and still essential cultural and social mission of the university in terms of intellectually beneficial policy good governance and efficient management history has proven that violations of academic freedom and university autonomy have always resulted in intellectual relapse and consequently in social and economic stagnation with the advent of the knowledge society it has become obvious that a new contract has to be reached between university and society to reflect and recognise new developments in such an understanding the social and cultural responsibility and accountability of universities to the public and to their mission are to be considered as the unavoidable other side of academic liberties,case originated application republic turkey lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental

any further publication of almost the entire first article on pain of an agreed penalty under articles and by analogy of the civil code see paragraph below read in the light of the right to protection of personality rights allgemeines persönlichkeitsrecht it ordered the applicant company to pay eur as a penalty under the agreement and to reimburse the procedural expenses eur plus statutory interest accrued from november according to the regional court the article in question which mentioned x s name and was accompanied by photos of him amounted to a serious interference with his right to the protection of his personality rights the disclosure of his criminal conduct had so to speak resulted in his being pilloried and discredited in the eyes of the public the court found that despite those negative effects reporting of that kind would nonetheless have been lawful in the event of serious crimes that were part of contemporary society and on which the press was entitled to report any interference with a criminal s private sphere was limited however by the proportionality principle which involved a balancing exercise between the competing interests the court held that in the present case the right to protection of x s personality rights prevailed over the public s interest in being informed even if the truth of the facts related by the daily had not been disputed neither the nature of the crime committed nor the person of x nor any other circumstances justified publication of the article at issue the court observed that whilst a drugs-related offence was not a petty crime particularly as in the present case it had been cocaine which was a hard drug x had been in possession of only a small quantity of that drug and had not been accused of drug trafficking the type of offence involved was of medium or even minor seriousness was a very common one and there was no particular public interest in knowing about it the court added that unlike serious crimes such as spectacular robberies or murders there were no particular circumstances distinguishing the offence in question from ordinary crimes even if there was an assumption that drug abuse was more widespread amongst key figures from the arts world and the media than in other circles furthermore the way in which the report had been made by the applicant company confirmed that the offence itself was not an important one the report had focussed more on x s person than on the offence which would probably never have been reported in the press if it had been committed by a person unknown to the public similarly the court pointed out whilst x s previous conviction for a similar offence was such as to increase the public s interest it was his only previous conviction and moreover dated back several years the court also found that publication of the articles in question was not justified by the person of x the public did admittedly show an interest in police superintendent y a character in a relatively popular television series but not in the actual person of the actor playing the part there was nothing to suggest that x attracted the attention of the public on account of his performance as an actor or other activities bringing him within a circle of persons about whom the public had a need for regular information the interest in x did not in any event go beyond the interest habitually manifested by the public in leading actors in german television series the court observed that the applicant company had published many articles about x over a period of six years and particularly over the last three years the vast majority of these publications had however merely mentioned x s name often without a photo among the names of celebrities invited to various events whilst it was undisputed that x had taken part in over national and international cinematographic and televised productions that did not convey much of an idea of his public importance indeed actors could have starred in hundreds of television series and still remain little known to the public there was no evidence that x had made a name for himself on account of any particular performance or that he had occupied a prominent position in society which had brought him into the public eye x had to an extent sought to attract the public s attention by giving interviews to certain magazines between and he therefore had to be more tolerant towards reports published about him than other wellknown figures who avoided the limelight according to the court x had not however courted the public to a degree that he could be considered to have implicitly waived his right to the protection of his personality rights the regional court conceded that the fact that the actor had broken the law whereas on television he played the role of a superintendent entrusted with crime prevention was more entertaining for the public than if the actor had played any other kind of role however that contrast between the television role and the personal lifestyle of the actor did not mean that the public confused the latter with the fictional character the actor merely donned the persona of a superintendent just as he could don that of any other character without thereby adopting the conduct of the character in question in his daily life the fact that an actor did not adopt the lifestyle of the character he played could not in any way be regarded as an extraordinary event worthy of being reported in the court s view viewers could distinguish between the actor and his role even where the actor was well known essentially for playing one particular character the found further that x had not sought to portray himself as an emblem of moral virtue neither had he adopted a stand on matters relating to drug abuse the interviews reported by the applicant company contained no comment by x on the subject in issue no of the magazine bunte x had stated in passing that he did not have any alcohol in the house and that he had become a big tea connaisseur in the court s view the fact that x had briefly remarked on his previous conviction in two interviews with magazines in and did not mean that he had portrayed himself as an advocate or critic of the fight against drugs or as an expert in the field that subject had been only marginally covered in the interview which had mainly concerned the actor s professional prospects and his difficulties in his relationships observing that when balancing the competing interests the decisive criteria were how well known x was and the seriousness of the offence with which he was charged the regional court found that the case concerned an actor who was not exceptionally well known and was accused of an offence which while not insignificant was not particularly spectacular and could be regarded as fairly common in the entertainment world the public did not therefore have a great interest in being informed of an event that was actually fairly anodyne whereas the information published amounted to a serious gravierend interference with x s right to the protection of his personality rights the found lastly that the applicant company was not justified in arguing that the publication of the article was lawful because it pursued legitimate interests admittedly the press officer from the public prosecutor s office at the munich regional court i had informed a large number of media reporters of the offence with which x had been charged and had disclosed his identity to them nor was there any doubt that the public prosecutor s office could be regarded as a privileged source privilegierte quelle of information that did not as a general rule require verification as to the truth of its content moreover three press agencies had disclosed similar details however even assuming that it had received all the information before publishing the article in question the applicant company could only conclude that the published information was true and was not thereby absolved from the requirement to check whether its publication was justified in terms of x s right to protection of his personality rights in the court s opinion the question of the veracity of information issued by a public authority had to be distinguished from that of the lawfulness of the subsequent publication of that information by the press the court found that it could be presumed that institutions providing a public service and in particular the public prosecutor s office and the police made every effort in accordance with the principle of neutrality not to issue information unless the public interest in doing so had been carefully weighed against that of the persons concerned however such institutions were not necessarily in a better position than a publisher to weigh the conflicting interests at stake regarding the dissemination of the information through the media in the instant case the applicant company was actually better placed than a member of the public prosecutor s office to judge the degree to which x was known and the question regarding whether the public had an interest in learning of his arrest on that point the court considered that account also had to be taken of the context in which the information was published the public services were not in a position to anticipate every possible form of dissemination of factual information in any foreseeable context or to foresee whether a report mentioning the person s name was justified or not accordingly publishers could not generally consider that the disclosure of a person s identity by a privileged source would make any kind of report on the person concerned legal without having first balanced the interests at stake the pointed out that there were situations in which there may be doubts regarding the assessment by the public authorities accordingly in the case of x the question arose as to whether it was appropriate for the public prosecutor s office to have expressed an opinion on the sentence that x could expect to receive when the criminal investigation had only just started the court concluded that the applicant company could not argue that it had relied on the disclosure of x s name by the public prosecutor s office on march the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company but reduced the amount of the agreed penalty to eur it upheld the conclusions of the regional court pointing out that the disclosure of a suspect s name when reporting on an offence constituted as a general rule a serious infringement of the right to the protection of personality rights even if it was a drug offence of medium or minor seriousness in x s case the fact of informing the public that he had taken cocaine could adversely affect his future prospects of securing acting roles and in particular of obtaining a role in an advertisement or in television series aimed at a young audience the court of appeal reiterated the relevant criteria when balancing the rights of the press against the right to protection of personality rights as established by the federal court of justice see paragraph below it confirmed that the nature of the offence and the exact circumstances in which it had been committed made it an everyday offence and would not have aroused any interest if the perpetrator had been little known in the court s opinion the possession and consumption of low quantities of drugs did not have adverse effects on third parties or on the general public as x had not taken cocaine in the tent in front of everyone his conduct did not imperil a young audience that might be likely to imitate him on account of his being a well-known television star the court of appeal acknowledged that the public had a particular interest in being informed and entertained because x was a well-known figure and had played the part of a police superintendent over a long period of time längerer zeitraum however even if x played that role this did not mean that he had himself necessarily become an idol or role model as a law-enforcement officer which could have increased the public s interest in the question whether in his private life he actually behaved like his character it was clear that the actor x could not be identified with the fictitious character of superintendent y that he played the fact that x had his fan clubs and had made public appearances as the actor who played the part of superintendent y did not alter that finding it could well be that x s appearance his manner of presenting himself and the relaxed attitude portrayed in his films appealed to others particularly a young audience that did not mean though that others saw in him a moral role model whose image should be corrected by the newspaper report in question the publications submitted by the applicant company were indeed evidence that x was hugely popular but did not support the contention that he had used confessions about his private life to attract the public s attention nor was the newspaper report justifiable on the ground that x had been arrested in public in a tent because the drug had actually been consumed in the men s toilets that is in a place that fell within the protected private sphere and out of public view lastly even if it were to be established that x s arrest was a matter of substantial public interest the same could not be said of the description and characterisation of the offence committed out of public view lastly while upholding the conclusions of the regarding the role of the public prosecutor s office the court of appeal stated that the applicant company s liability did not extend beyond minor negligence given that the information disclosed by the public prosecutor s office had led it to believe that the report was lawful the illegal disclosure by the public prosecutor s office did not however make publication by the applicant company legal the court of appeal accordingly reduced the agreed penalty to eur it refused leave to appeal on points of law because its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the federal court of justice on november the federal court of justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law on december the federal court of justice dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions anhörungsrüge it stated that when balancing the public s interest in being informed about public criminal proceedings against an interference with the defendant s private sphere the court of appeal had taken into account the circumstances of the case and had reached its decision in accordance with the criteria established in its case-law there was no evidence that the relevant criteria for the balancing exercise had been disregarded the federal court of justice stated that the fact that the civil courts had found against the applicant company did not permit the latter to lodge an appeal on points of law and did not amount to a violation of the right to be heard the second set of proceedings on august the granted an application by x for an injunction against any further publication of the second article by a judgment of may the regional court granted x s application in the main proceedings ordered the applicant company to refrain from any further publication of the second article on pain of penalty and ordered it to pay eur in costs plus statutory interest accrued from september it based its decision on essentially the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of november see paragraphs above it stated that the case in question had to be distinguished from the one that had been the subject of the judgment of the federal court of justice of november see paragraph below in that the person concerned in that case prince ernst august von hannover was much more widely known than x so the press had been entitled to report on the substantial penalty imposed in that case on september the hamburg court of appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company on essentially the same grounds as those given in its judgment of march see paragraphs above on the subject of the relevant criteria for weighing the conflicting interests it stated that according to the judgment of the federal constitutional court of june see paragraph below the fact that a person was a prominent figure or one known to the public was not a sufficient factor in itself to justify the existence of an interest on the part of the public in being informed of his or her conduct in the present case the public s interest in being informed and entertained which derived from the fact that x was a well-known figure and starred as a superintendent in a television series was insufficient to justify the interference with his right to decide for himself which information he was willing to disclose informationelle selbstbestimmung the applicant company s reliance on the high audience rating of the television series y. did not in the court of appeal s opinion prove that x. had served as a role model or a counter model if a role model existed for millions of viewers the role model in question was the character of the superintendent the court of appeal reiterated that the fact that x. had been arrested in a public place did not make the newspaper article lawful because the offence itself had been committed out of public view in the men s toilets the suspicious movement that x had made with his hand had admittedly attracted the attention of the police at the scene but it had not been established that other persons present in the tent had noticed that x had taken cocaine the court of appeal added that whilst the fact that the quality press had reported the case might indicate that there was a not insignificant nicht geringes interest in reporting it that was not a basis on which to conclude that the interference with x s right to the protection of his personality rights had been lawful the court of appeal refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the federal court of justice in particular the latter s judgment of november see paragraph below on april the federal court of justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law on june it dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions on march a three-judge panel of the declined to entertain constitutional appeals lodged by the applicant company against the court decisions delivered in the first and second sets of proceedings it stated that it was not giving reasons for its decision on september and january the ordered the applicant company to pay x two penalty payments of eur each one for having breached the order of august see paragraph above the court criticised the applicant company for inter alia publishing in the july edition of the daily newspaper die welt and on the newspaper s internet page welt.de on march the following statement by one of its editors accordingly we had no right whatsoever to report on the trial of the popular actor x for possession of cocaine even though he was a very well-known recidivist and the offence was committed at the beer festival in article of the civil code bürgerliches gestezbuch provides that anyone who intentionally or negligently unlawfully infringes another s right to life physical integrity health freedom property or other similar right shall be liable to make compensation for the resulting damage in accordance with article where another s property is damaged otherwise than by removal or illegal retention the owner may require the perpetrator to cease the interference if there are reasonable fears that further damage will be inflicted the owner may seek an injunction in its judgment of november no vi zr the federal court of justice reiterated its established case-law according to which the decisive criteria for evaluating the lawfulness of a news report mentioning the name of the person concerned were the nature of the offence and the person of the suspect the facts of the case were a fine and a prohibition on driving imposed by the french courts for speeding on a motorway instead of km per hour on a person known to the public the federal court of justice found firstly that the speed limit had been exceeded to such an extent that it could be regarded as an expression of extreme contempt for the highway regulations and secondly that the offence had put other motorists at considerable risk moreover both the manner in which the person concerned had behaved in public in the past and his origins and the fact that he was the husband of a very well-known individual meant that the interest of the press in publishing a news report prevailed over the right to protection of the personality rights of the person concerned the federal court of justice pointed out that the court s judgment in the case of von hannover v. of june no echr allowed of no other conclusion the articles and photos in that case had concerned only scenes from caroline von hannover s daily life and had aimed merely to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership regarding her private life in a decision of june no bvr a three-judge panel of the decided not to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged against the judgment of the federal court of justice and upheld the latter s findings the relevant passages of recommendation rec of the committee of ministers to member states on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings adopted on july at the meeting of the ministers deputies read as follows recalling that the media have the right to inform the public due to the right of the public to receive information including information on matters of public concern under article of the convention and that they have a professional duty to do so recalling that the rights to presumption of innocence to a fair trial and to respect for private and family life under articles and of the convention constitute fundamental requirements which must be respected in any democratic society stressing the importance of media reporting in informing the public on criminal proceedings making the deterrent function of criminal law visible as well as in ensuring public scrutiny of the functioning of the criminal justice system considering the possibly conflicting interests protected by articles and of the convention and the necessity to balance these rights in view of the facts of every individual case with due regard to the supervisory role of the european court of human rights in ensuring the observance of the commitments under the convention recommends while acknowledging the diversity of national legal systems concerning criminal procedure that the governments of member states take or reinforce as the case may be all measures which they consider necessary with a view to the implementation of the principles appended to this recommendation within the limits of their respective constitutional provisions appendix to recommendation rec principles concerning the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings principle information of the public via the media the public must be able to receive information about the activities of judicial authorities and police services through the media therefore journalists must be able to freely report and comment on the functioning of the criminal justice system subject only to the limitations provided for under the following principles principle presumption of innocence respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence is an integral part of the right to a fair trial accordingly opinions and information relating to on-going criminal proceedings should only be communicated or disseminated through the media where this does not prejudice the presumption of innocence of the suspect or accused principle accuracy of information judicial authorities and police services should provide to the media only verified information or information which is based on reasonable assumptions in the latter case this should be clearly indicated to the media principle access to information when journalists have lawfully obtained information in the context of on-going criminal proceedings from judicial authorities or police services those authorities and services should make available such information without discrimination to all journalists who make or have made the same request principle protection of privacy in the context of on-going criminal proceedings the provision of information about suspects accused or convicted persons or other parties to criminal proceedings should respect their right to protection of privacy in accordance with article of the convention particular protection should be given to parties who are minors or other vulnerable persons as well as to victims to witnesses and to the families of suspects accused and convicted in all cases particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling their identification may have on the persons referred to in this principle. the relevant passages of this resolution adopted by the parliamentary assembly on june read as follows the assembly is aware that personal privacy is often invaded even in countries with specific legislation to protect it as people s private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media the victims are essentially public figures since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales at the same time public figures must recognise that the special position they occupy in society in many cases by choice automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy public figures are persons holding public office and/or using public resources and more broadly speaking all those who play a role in public life whether in politics the economy the arts the social sphere sport or in any other domain it is often in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right to freedom of expression which is guaranteed in article of the european convention on human rights that the media invade people s privacy claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures certain facts relating to the private lives of public figures particularly politicians may indeed be of interest to citizens and it may therefore be legitimate for readers who are also voters to be informed of those facts it is therefore necessary to find a way of balancing the exercise of two fundamental rights both of which are guaranteed by the european convention on human rights the right to respect for one s private life and the right to freedom of expression the assembly reaffirms the importance of every person s right to privacy and of the right to freedom of expression as fundamental to a democratic society these rights are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order since they are of equal value however the assembly points out that the right to privacy afforded by article of the european convention on human rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities but also against interference by private persons or institutions including the mass media the assembly believes that since all member states have now ratified the european convention on human rights and since many systems of national legislation comprise provisions guaranteeing this protection there is no need to propose that a new convention guaranteeing the right to privacy should be adopted,case originated application federal republic germany lodged court article convention protection human rights

the case originated in an application no against the republic of latvia lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a latvian national mr andris rubins the applicant on december the applicant was represented by ms i. betkere a lawyer practising in riga the latvian government the government were represented by their agent ms k. līce the applicant alleged in particular that his dismissal from his university post following a critical email sent to the rector constituted a violation of his right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention on october the government were given notice of the complaint concerning article of the convention and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible the applicant was born in and lives in riga the applicant was a professor and the head of the department of dermatological and venereal diseases of the faculty of medicine of riga stradiņa university hereafter the university which is a state university the applicant had been elected to the position of head of department with effect until april he was also an elected member of the constituent assembly of the university satversmes sapulce on february the council of the faculty of medicine decided to merge the department of dermatological and venereal diseases and the department of infectious diseases that decision was approved by the senate of the university senāts on the following day it appears that as a result of the merger the position of head of department occupied by the applicant was abolished accordingly on february the applicant received a warning brīdinājums to that effect and was given the opportunity to agree to the changes in his contract with the university he was also informed that if he refused his employment relationship with the university would be terminated on february the applicant sent various emails to the rector of the university concerning the circumstances of the reorganisation and the abolition of his department he criticised the decisions taken by the deputy dean g.b on march the applicant sent another email to the rector of the university and to several other recipients including the members of the senate the email criticised the lack of democracy and accountability in the leadership of the organisation which according to the applicant stemmed from the fact that all the members of the senate were also a part of the executive authority of the university and there was thus an inadequate system of checks and balances he also drew the recipients attention to the alleged mismanagement of the university s finances in support of this allegation the applicant relied on the conclusions adopted by the state audit office valsts kontrole in december the applicant further spoke in unfavourable terms about several representatives of the management of the university stating for example that mr pretends to be a god-fearing catholic yet as far as is known has several children born out of wedlock that mr can not decide a single question by himself does not keep his word is lying and that mrs has called me and asked me to break the law in the interests of her protégés finally the applicant came up with a proposal involving several amendments to the constitution of the university such as changes in the election of the members of the senate an obligation to inform the constituent assembly of the candidate s cv at least one week before the elections the setting-up of an independent electoral commission separation of powers between the university s governing bodies senate members should not be part of the executive body of the university and the granting of independence to the senate changing the remuneration system so that the rector did not unilaterally fix the remuneration of members of the senate he asked the rector to forward his proposals to the members of the constituent assembly and to send him the email addresses of those members or inform him where to find those contacts it appears that on march the applicant expressed his disagreement with the reorganisation at the meeting of the senate of the university which upheld the decision on march the applicant sent an email to the rector of the university the subject-line of the email read settlement agreement the text of the email read as follows on march the rector replied to the applicant that he could not agree to any of the proposals the following day march at the meeting of the constituent assembly of the university the applicant expressed his disagreement with the reorganisation and asked that the decision concerning the merger of faculties be annulled his request was not upheld on the same day the national news agency leta published the applicant s views about the alleged shortcomings in the management of the university the criticisms referred to the conclusions of the state audit office on and march the rector asked an ad hoc investigative committee and the ethics committee to review the applicant s conduct on may the applicant received a notice of termination of employment uzteikums from the university in which he was informed that his employment contract with the university would be terminated ten days after receipt of the notice the legal basis for the applicant s dismissal was section and of the labour law and the applicant was deemed to have acted in contravention of several provisions of the university s staff regulations see relevant domestic law part paragraphs and below the notice stated inter alia as follows the ground for dismissal is the email you sent to the rector of the university on march in which while addressing the rector concerning issues of interest to you you included inappropriate demands including elements of blackmail and undisguised threats as a consequence your actions are considered as very grave infringements of basic ethical principles and standards of behaviour and as absolutely contrary to good morals the fact of sending such a letter and its contents are clearly contrary to good morals all the more so taking into account the circumstances in which the letter was sent and your attitude. on may the university dismissed the applicant from his post soon afterwards he took up a post in another university in latvia the applicant submitted a claim to the riga city kurzeme district court asking the court to invalidate the notice of termination and to order his reinstatement and payment of the unpaid salary and benefits together with compensation for non-pecuniary damage in a judgment of march the kurzeme district court allowed the applicant s claim in part it held that the fact that the applicant s employer had been offended by his email was not a legitimate reason for his dismissal since section of the labour law did not include such a ground the court considered that the allegation that the applicant s email had contained elements of blackmail and threats was merely speculation on his employer s behalf it was additionally found that the applicant had not been given an adequate opportunity to respond to the allegations contained in the termination notice before that notice was sent to him accordingly the court annulled the termination notice and ordered the applicant s reinstatement with back-payment of his salary the applicant s claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage was rejected as unsubstantiated both the applicant and the university appealed during the court hearing the applicant mentioned that he had requested that several illegalities be examined at the meeting of the constituent assembly of march counsel for the defendant stated that both the ad hoc investigative committees set up by the rector had found that the content of the letter was to be perceived as blackmail and threats he contended that the request to receive a certain amount in compensation and the deadline by which the reply had to be received all proved the breach of ethical norms the defendant further alleged that several defamatory facts about the university had been published on march by leta and considered that the above activities therefore confirmed the threats made in the applicant s email on january the riga regional court quashed the first-instance court s judgment and dismissed the applicant s claim in full the appeal court considered that in his email of march the applicant had invited the rector to carry out unlawful actions namely to annul a decision of the senate of the university concerning the merger of two departments within the faculty of medicine such action was deemed to be unlawful because annulling decisions of the senate of the university exceeded the rector s authority the court also considered that the applicant had requested unreasonably high compensation for the termination of his employment these two considerations led the appeal court to conclude that the applicant had failed to observe basic ethical principles such as honesty collegiality and responsibility the conclusions of the appeal court echoed those reached by the university s ethics committee and by two ad hoc investigative committees set up on march and april in particular the court observed in point that the committee had concluded that the infringements committed by the applicant were demonstrated by the fact that he had sent the email and had carried out other activities after the senate s decision of february including making unfounded statements for example about the abolition of the department the circumstances of the reorganisation that had been directed against the applicant and threats made by g.b against the applicant the email of february comprises statements for example about private life and religious convictions the court further noted that it was apparent from the materials in the case file that on march the national news agency leta had published the applicant s views about events in the university in which he had criticised the leadership of the university stating that a group of twelve to fifteen persons had usurped all power and set up an authoritarian or even dictatorial regime the court also referred to the content of the email the applicant had sent on march see paragraph above and came to the conclusion that he had contravened the obligation to treat the staff of the university with respect the court turned next to the question of good morals and after finding that this term had no precise legal definition proceeded to conclude that it consisted of three basic ethical principles the principle of integrity and righteousness the principle of responsibility and the principle of loyalty it found that the applicant had acted in breach of these principles and that there was no reason to conclude that the applicant had only intended to inform the rector about his plan to exercise his democratic rights that is to submit complaints to the courts and to publish information in the media while respecting the interests of society the content of the letter of march attests to the applicant s wish to act for a selfish cause namely to retain his position as a head of department contrary to the senate s decision on reorganisation or to receive substantial financial compensation regardless of the need to use the budget of the university in an economical and reasonable way in compliance with the goals of the university the appeal court finds that there is no evidence that prior to the letter of march the university had obstructed the applicant s democratic rights to inform society and the competent institutions about the alleged violations in the university taking into account the aforementioned finding that is that the applicant s aim in writing the letter of march was selfish the appeal court finds that the applicant sought to achieve a result beneficial to himself by trying to persuade the rector to take unlawful steps in view of the aforementioned considerations this should be considered a threat. turning to the applicant s claim for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage the appeal court cited section of the labour law see the relevant domestic law part paragraph below and disagreed that the applicant s dismissal had created unjustified consequences nepamatotas sekas or caused non-pecuniary damage simply because the applicant had expressed legitimate concerns about the reorganisation of the university and about the way its financial resources were used the court s reasoning in that regard read as follows the appeal court on the basis of experience and logic finds that a calm and positive atmosphere and a respectful attitude among colleagues best contribute to achieving constructive dialogue having analysed the above-mentioned evidence the appeal court considers that nothing prevented the applicant from expressing his opinion in a manner compatible with ethics and the staff regulations the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law disputing inter alia the appeal court s findings to the effect that by sending one confidential letter to one recipient namely the rector of the university in which he had raised points concerning the unjustified use of funds from the state budget he had committed an infringement of work-related rules and ethics of such gravity as to justify his dismissal the applicant also invoked in this connection that he had an obligation to inform the society about the unjustified use of funds therefore the appellate court had erred in finding that the impugned email was unethical the applicant s appeal on points of law was rejected by the senate of the supreme court in a preparatory meeting on september on september the rector of the university sought to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant for extortion the criminal proceedings were instituted on january on the basis of section of the criminal law extortion and the applicant was ordered not to leave his permanent residence for more than twenty-four hours without the permission of the competent investigative authority the criminal proceedings were discontinued on february for lack of corpus delicti the decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings stated inter alia that according to the linguistic expert s conclusions the impugned email contained clearly expressed demands to pay a certain amount of money as well as undisguised threats to disclose disreputable information about the rector prior to the meeting of the senate it also noted that the email demonstrated the applicant s wish to act selfishly either in order to maintain his post or to receive a significant amount in compensation for the termination of his employment contract however as the rector s attitude demonstrated that the threats were not perceived as real the court ruled that the criminal proceedings should be terminated and that the rector had the right to institute defamation proceedings section of the labour law a whistle-blowers protection clause provides that an employee may not be punished or otherwise directly or indirectly subjected to unfavourable treatment in the context of employment relations for exercising his rights in a permissible manner pieļaujamā veidā or informing the competent authorities or officials about suspicions of criminal or administrative offences in his place of employment if in the event of a dispute an employee reports such circumstances which could serve as a basis for unfavourable treatment by his or her employer it is the employer s duty to prove that the employee has not been punished or otherwise unfavourably affected either directly or indirectly for having exercised his or her rights in the context of employment relations in a permissible manner section and of the labour law authorises employers to dismiss an employee only on the basis of circumstances related to the employee s conduct or his or her abilities or in connection with the performance of economic organisational technological or similar functions within the company if the employee in the absence of extenuating circumstances has committed significant infringements of his or her employment contract or terms of employment and the employee has fulfilled his or her duties in a manner that disregards good morals labi tikumi and such actions are not compatible with his or her continued employment. the same section further provides that if an employer intends to issue a notice of termination of an employment contract on the basis of inter alia the first paragraph sub-paragraphs and of this section the employer has a duty to request written explanations from the employee when deciding on the possible termination of the employment contract the employer has a duty to evaluate the severity of the violation at issue and the circumstances in which it was committed as well as the personal characteristics of the employee and his or her previous work record point of the constituent document of the university rīgas stradiņa universitātes satversme provides that the rector or the senate may convene the constituent assembly of the university the rector the senate or the student self-government body may convene an extraordinary meeting of the constituent assembly pursuant to point the rector has a right of suspensive veto atliekošā veto tiesības over decisions adopted by the senate point of the statue of the senate senāta nolikums provides that senate meetings are convened inter alia at the initiative of the rector the relevant provisions of the staff regulations in force at the university at the material time read as follows employees must carry out their tasks conscientiously and honestly employees must treat other members of the university staff with respect employees have a responsibility to carry out work of good quality in accordance with their contract and job description the constitution of the university decisions of the senate internal regulations and orders and the external legislation of the republic of latvia according to the view of the senate of the supreme court published in a compilation of case-law on employment disputes the final assessment of whether an infringement of an employment contract or staff regulation is grave lies with the domestic courts furthermore the term good morals section paragraph sub-paragraph of the labour law is applicable not only to work carried out within the specified working hours but may also refer to employment-related functions performed outside regular working hours since the legislature failed to define the term good morals this term has been acknowledged to be a general clause the content of which has to be defined by the courts case-law according to present-day case-law and legal science the term good morals in addition to its social character also has a legal dimension that is it encompasses not only generally accepted moral standards but also ethical principles and values enshrined inter alia in the constitution thus according to the senate the reference to the term good morals is a general clause the content of which has to be determined by those who apply the law,case originated application republic latvia lodged court

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a polish national ms maria katarzyna łopuch the applicant on july the applicant was represented by mr z. barwina a lawyer practising in the polish government the government were represented by their agent mr j. wołąsiewicz of the ministry of foreign affairs the applicant alleged that her right to freedom of expression as provided for in article of the convention had been breached on june the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the applicant was born in and lives in the applicant was involved in two sets of civil proceedings for payment pending before the szczecin district court in one of them she was a defendant and in another she represented her mother h.k on june the applicant submitted her pleadings in the second case to the szczecin district court she argued that her mother had not given any grounds on which to institute execution proceedings against her because she had already paid the amounts awarded to the plaintiff she stated that the efforts to have that judgment executed was a result of criminal activity of a group of persons acting with a view to intimidating threatening and extorting money from h.k and from the applicant and her family and threatening h.k. s life this amounted to a real danger to h.k as she was years old and in poor health this group of a criminal nature was composed of lawyer d.n acting in a corrupt mafia-like setup under the aegis of j.s. the president of the szczecin district court. upon receipt of her pleadings the president of the szczecin district court forwarded it to the supervising judge of the with a view to examining whether it would be justified to inform the prosecutor that a criminal offence punishable under article of the criminal code had been committed on july the president of the informed the szczecinśródmieście prosecutor of the applicant s pleadings on august the prosecutor instituted an investigation in the case on august the applicant was summoned to the szczecinśródmieście police station to be questioned on september as a witness in a defamation case she complied with the summons and was informed that in fact she was to be questioned as a suspect she availed herself of her right to refuse to testify on october she submitted pleadings to the szczecinśródmieście prosecutor s office requesting that j.s and three other persons be questioned in the case on november the szczecinśródmieście prosecutor s office lodged a public bill of indictment against the applicant with the szczecinśródmieście district court she was charged with the offence of defamation punishable under article of the criminal code on february the supreme court acting upon a request submitted to it by the ordered that the case should be transferred to the gorzów wielkopolski district court on august that court acting in simplified proceedings found the applicant guilty of committing an offence of defamation against judge j.s and imposed a fine on her in the amount of polish zlotys pln equivalent to daily fines in the amount of pln each the applicant lodged an objection against this judgment with that court and requested that it should be examined in normal criminal proceedings she submitted inter alia that she had never made her pleadings of june public and argued that the contested judgment was in line with the worst communist traditions and it undermined the foundations of the democratic rule of law of the state. following her objection the gorzów wielkopolski district court examined her case anew in pleadings of december the applicant requested that j.s. d.n who was representing the opposite party in her mother s case see paragraph above and two other individuals should be questioned as witnesses she also requested that l.w. a journalist who had published an article about her criminal case entitled a corrupt mafialike setup mafijnokorupcyjny układ in a local newspaper be questioned by the court she stressed that information about the case must have leaked to the newspaper from the prosecutor s office as she had not given information about the case to anyone during a hearing held on february judge j.s was questioned he submitted that he knew the applicant as he had been the president of the szczecin district court the applicant had on many occasions written to him complaining about various alleged shortcomings in civil proceedings in which she had been involved he submitted that he had answered many of her complaints in writing including those couched in strong terms but that as a matter of principle he had not requested the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against her in pleadings submitted to the court on the same date the applicant cited article of the constitution which guaranteed freedom of expression and article of the convention she submitted that the offence punishable under article was to be examined in proceedings instituted by private prosecution however in her case it was the public prosecutor who had brought the bill of indictment to the court she reiterated that the proceedings against her were part of a campaign of intimidation against her and her elderly mother she had made the submissions concerned in the case in the context of a civil case and they should have been regarded as legitimate means of defending her interests protected by civil law she reiterated that she had never made those pleadings public and that the journalist who had published the article about that letter must have been informed of it by the prosecuting office by a judgment of february the court found the applicant guilty of the offence of defamation punishable under article of the criminal code and imposed a fine of pln seventy daily fines of pln on her the court referred to her pleadings of june and held that the facts of the case had not given rise to any doubt the allegations of lack of impartiality and the alleged failure to respect standards of professional conduct contained in the pleadings could clearly lower judge j.s in the estimation of the public or undermine public confidence in his capacity to hold his judicial position the applicant s document had a public character as it was formulated in official pleadings to a court the files of judicial proceedings being accessible to all the parties to these proceedings moreover there was a risk that its content could become known to the members of the public in the courtroom if it was read out during the proceedings the allegations thus placed in the public domain were untrue and capable of undermining j.s. s good reputation they had to be seen in the context of a possible threat of loss of public trust in his capacity to carry out his judicial profession the court further found that the applicant had written a number of letters to judge j.s in his capacity as president of the court making various allegations about the judges of that court she alleged that certain judges were party to a mafialike setup and complained that judge j.s had been interfering with the conduct of cases in which the applicant was involved to her detriment she had alleged that he had passed a death sentence on the applicant s family in his replies judge j.s had repeatedly drawn the applicant s attention to the inappropriate terms she used and requested her to stop using offensive language the court was of the view that the applicant had acted with the direct intention zamiar bezpośredni of insulting the judge however the offence was not particularly dangerous because the offence of defamation breached only the honour of an individual person concerned without violating other legally protected interests or values hence the fine in the amount of pln was justified as being capable of having both a dissuasive and a punitive effect on the applicant the court noted that the applicant was unemployed but she was young had a good education and was able to find work and pay the fine in instalments if need be the applicant appealed she again referred to article of the constitution guaranteeing the freedom of expression and article of the convention arguing that the judgment breached them by a judgment of may the upheld the contested judgment it was of the view that the lower court had correctly established the facts of the case the applicant s allegations about j.s. s involvement in any mafialike setup could not be regarded as legitimate criticism the applicant did not have objective grounds on which to formulate such a view and she had thereby overstepped the limits of acceptable criticism article of the criminal code provides as follows anyone who imputes to another person a group of persons an institution a legal person or an organisation without legal personality such behaviour or characteristics as may lower this person group or entity in the public s opinion or undermine public confidence in their capacity necessary for a certain position occupation or type of activity shall be liable to a fine a restriction on their liberty or imprisonment not exceeding one year if the perpetrator commits the act described in

to my dismissal entfernung aus dem dienst the information preceding the declaration on the signed form explained among other things the meaning of the expression free democratic constitutional system as defined by the federal constitutional court bundesverfassungsgericht in its judgments of october and august on this point the document stated the fundamental principles of this system include respect for human rights as defined in the basic law in particular the right to life and free development of the personality the sovereignty of the people the separation of powers the government s

for civil-service posts may not be appointed if they support activities inimical to the constitution verfassungs- feindlich disciplinary proceedings for dismissal will be brought against civil servants guilty of such a breach of duty the legal basis of the declaration signed by the applicant was the north rhine-westphalia civil servants act in its version of may section provides that in order to be appointed a civil servant a candidate must give the guarantee that at all times he or she will uphold the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the basic law by virtue of section a civil servant must undertake to bear witness to and to uphold this system by his every word and deed the wording of the declaration which the relevant land authorities required every candidate for a post in the civil service to make corresponded to the directives that the minister of the interior in düsseldorf had drawn up on november for the implementation of the decree on the employment of extremists in the civil service ministerpräsidenten-beschluss these directives were later amended on april and january the decree on the employment of extremists had been adopted on january by the federal chancellor and the prime ministers of the länder to ensure uniformity of administrative practice in the matter it reiterates civil servants legal duty of loyalty to the free democratic constitutional system and in paragraph provides official gazette ministerialblatt of the land of north rhine-westphalia p. every case must be examined and decided according to its particular circumstances regard must be had in the process to the following principles if a civil servant fails to comply with his duty of loyalty to the constitution the appointing authority shall draw the necessary conclusions on the basis of the particular facts established in his case and consider whether grounds exist for dismissing him from the service entfernung aus dem dienst german civil servants special duty of loyalty to the state and its constitution has been confirmed and clarified by the in particular in a judgment on may entscheidungen des bundesverfassungsgerichts vol pp in accordance with the directives of november the appropriate authority in münster asked the land minister of the interior on june for information about possible extremist activities of mrs. glasenapp on september the ministry replied as follows from to g lived in in a commune kommune to which members of maoist communist organisations belonged at least four members of the anti-imperialist league were living in this commune at the time the league is a maoist communist organisation close to the kpd german communist party the telephone number of one of the other members of the commune was the ‘ contact phone for the zentrale der westberliner oberschüler centre for west berlin high school pupils a communist organisation run by the communist students association ksv glasenapp did not attract attention by activities of her own a copy of this letter was handed to mrs. glasenapp on september during an interview to which she had been called by the relevant land authority to discuss the possibility of her appointment as a secondary-school teacher she stated that she would reply in writing after consulting her lawyer the latter indicated mrs. glasenapp s position in a letter of september in his opinion the ministry of the interior obviously did not know of any circumstances which made mrs. glasenapp s attitude towards the free democratic system clear in her application for appointment she had declared that she was prepared at all times to uphold this system she was very anxious to point out that she had not lived in a commune in between and she had lived in a house in which she occupied one of thirteen rooms as a sub-tenant her lawyer added that it scarcely accorded with the principles of a state based on the rule of law to use information relating to third persons who had lived in the same building to the detriment of his client he called on the authority concerned to take a decision within a week failing which he would take the matter to court on the same day the applicant invited representatives of the daily newspapers to attend a press conference on september she wanted to publicise the delay in appointing her and the fact that it was due to doubts not connected directly with her activities but with the place where she had lived according to her lawyer the press conference was intended to promote mrs. glasenapp s case nachdruck verleihen by putting the matter before a large section of the public and showing how the decree on the employment of extremists in the civil service was being applied on september the relevant authority received the written observations of mrs. glasenapp s lawyer it considered that any doubts about her had been cleared up and it accordingly decided to appoint her as a secondary-school teacher with the status of probationary civil servant at the städtisches aufbaugymnasium high school in dortmund-brünninghausen she was immediately notified of this decision the very next day mrs. glasenapp took up her duties and was handed her letter of appointment ernennungsurkunde still on september the applicant distributed in the school copies of a personal statement and of the minister of the interior s letter of september see paragraph above during the morning break she discussed with pupils outside the school the decree on the employment of extremists see paragraph above then accompanied by her lawyer she held the press conference she had arranged see paragraph above the next day the westfälische rundschau one of the daily newspapers which reported the press conference published an article which included the following passage the art teacher kunsterzieherin who left no doubt that she was neither a member of the kpd nor a communist sympathiser added ‘ this clearly demonstrates the need for individual political vigilance to counter the erosion of fundamental democratic rights the first part of this sentence prompted mrs. glasenapp to write to the paper as it did not publish her letter she communicated the text to the teachers and research workers trade union gewerkschaft für erziehung und wissenschaft and to a number of organisations interested in the rules prohibiting appointments berufsverbote the letter was published on october by the journal of the kpd the rote fahne at the end of a short article it read as follows with reference to the article ‘ living under one roof with communists published in the westfälische rundschau of september your sub-editor hans leyendecker is using the delay in my appointment as a secondary-school teacher studienrätin zur anstellung which was due to unlawful action on the part of the ministry of the interior to indulge in anti-communist propaganda he interprets my statement ‘ i am not a member of the kpd as meaning that i dissociate myself from the kpd or from its policies that is not the case on the contrary i pointed out in the discussion that i support the kpd s policy e.g in the north of the city nordstadt i am a member of a committee to set up an international people s kindergarten responsibility for the situation of the children in the north of the city lies with the hoesch firm and the social democrat city council the kpd is in fact the only party concerned about the problem in my opinion teachers who take an interest in these matters are better teachers than the npd german national democratic party candidates in the regional elections at the wickede school or the teachers who beat the children as we have been told is the case by pupils in the oesterholz school although it bears the same name this kpd which broke up in was not the same organisation as the former german communist party which was banned by the federal constitutional court on august entscheidungen des bundesverfassungsgerichts vol pp see also the commission s decision of july on the admissibility of application no yearbook of the convention vol pp nor should it be confused with the present german communist party the dkp deutsche kommunistische partei in october the land ministry of education kultusministerium and the responsible authority in münster on learning of this letter and other publications in the local press relating to mrs. glasenapp considered whether she should be dismissed for wilful deceit under section of the land civil servants act to give her an opportunity to put her case section of the same act the responsible authority invited her to an interview which took place on november according to the minutes of the interview the authority told the applicant that the letter published in the rote fahne had caused it to consider whether her appointment as a probationary civil servant had been obtained by wilful deceit and whether she should be dismissed she replied that she had written the letter after consulting her lawyer who was present at the meeting with whom she had not however discussed the exact wording she added i protest against the fact that this letter is being made the subject of an official interview dienstgespräch i believe that the right to publish such a letter is one of my fundamental democratic rights i have formed this opinion after getting detailed advice from several lawyers on this matter i should therefore like to confine myself to saying the following i maintain the declaration in which i said that i was ready at all times to uphold the free democratic system and likewise my written declaration of september reaffirming that i am in no doubt that i have so far complied with this undertaking in my conduct by writing the letter to the westfälische rundschau i wished to point out that the kpd s work in the north of was well conceived and that i therefore supported it people s kindergarten it was not my intention to pass any judgment on the kpd s programme and i can not do so now i am not a member of the kpd i firmly believe that my criticisms of the minister of the interior had no connection with my official duties dienstverhältnis and i therefore do not consider that i have committed a breach of my obligations as a civil servant in answer to a question mrs. glasenapp said she had not sent her letter to the rote fahne but distributed it to relatives and acquaintances bekannte as it was of the view that the applicant had not made her attitude towards the kpd s policies sufficiently clear the land authority wrote to her on november as follows so long as you do not certify in writing that you do not support the kpd s policies we must assume that you do not agree to abide by your declarations of may and september the authority pointed out that the kpd according to its own statements published in the rote fahne was trying to overthrow the political system in the federal republic of germany by force and that to support its policies was contrary to the duties of a civil servant the applicant s lawyer replied on november that in view of her rights protected by the basic law his client did not consider it necessary to state her views referring to her written declarations and the interview on november she requested that a final decision should be taken now without any investigation of her political opinions she did not intend to answer such questions on december the authority recommended to the land ministry of education that mrs. glasenapp should be dismissed for wilful deceit the ministry having signified its agreement on december the authority dismissed her on january in its decision the authority observed that contrary to her declarations of may and september the applicant was not prepared to approve or uphold by her conduct the principles of the free democratic constitutional system as appeared from her letter in the rote fahne mrs. glasenapp supported activities directed against that system and its fundamental principles she had represented herself as favouring a party which worked against that system and whose policy was aimed at overthrowing it in the federal republic of germany by force she had not explained sufficiently clearly the contradictions between the two aforementioned declarations and her letter which she had not retracted she had refused to state that she did not support the kpd s policies it had therefore to be conceded that she did not intend to abide by her former declarations she had thus deceived the authority and improperly obtained her appointment which must therefore be revoked by virtue of section of the civil servants act by virtue of section of the act the legal effect of the authority s decision once it became final would be that the applicant had at no time enjoyed the status of probationary civil servant das beamtenverhältnis von anfang an nicht bestanden mrs. glasenapp lodged an objection widerspruch on january she filed her grounds on january she considered that the decision of january was unlawful because the conditions of section of the land civil servants act were not satisfied her letter published as it was after her declarations of loyalty and after her appointment might possibly lead one to suppose that she was no longer prepared to uphold the free democratic system but not that she had deliberately deceived the authority in may and september she had protested to the contrary at the interview on november she had not been able to dissociate herself from the kpd s programme for the simple reason that she did not know what it was a responsible person could not be expected to distance herself from the policy of a party whose aims and objectives she did not know nor had she declared that she favoured the kpd her support for the establishment of a kindergarten originally proposed by that party was evidence of her social commitment and not of an attitude of hostility to the constitution as her objection had a suspensive effect she continued to work at the high school on january however the authority ordered the immediate execution of its decision of january section of the administrative courts act verwaltungsgerichtsordnung as it considered that the applicant s behaviour at the school made proper teaching impossible on february mrs. glasenapp applied for a stay of execution but the verwaltungsgericht refused the application eight days later she entered an appeal beschwerde which the land administrative court of appeal oberverwaltungsgericht dismissed on june according to the findings in the judgment schoolchildren had distributed a tract outside the school on january describing the applicant as a victim of the anti-constitutional decree on the employment of extremists in the civil service and calling on young people to sign a petition for her reinstatement at the same time and place the applicant and a girl pupil had mounted a demonstration with a strip of material covering their mouths while the girl carried a placard which read the submissive civil servant sees nothing hears nothing and says nothing two days later mrs. glasenapp had distributed outside the school a pamphlet issued by a committee against the rules prohibiting appointments furthermore a woman and three children had tried to hold a demonstration inside the school in favour of the kpd and the applicant on being removed they had continued their demonstration outside the building and according to the headmaster the applicant had joined them there finally the court of appeal found that during break on january mrs. glasenapp had discussed her case with a large number of pupils about a hundred of whom accompanied by the applicant had demanded that the headmaster should discuss the question of their teacher s suspension with them the land authority rejected her objection on august it noted in particular that the letter in question could not but be regarded as an expression of support for the kpd neither the wording of it nor mrs. glasenapp s attitude left any room for believing that she had simply wished to approve an isolated endeavour by the kpd ever since her attention had been drawn to the inconsistency between her declarations of may and september and her open letter she had refused to certify in writing as she had been asked to do on november that she did not support the kpd when assessing her declaration in favour of this party it was of little account that the party was running infant classes which might be desirable from the social point of view the only relevant consideration was that it was pursuing ends which were contrary to the constitution in view of mrs. glasenapp s support of the kpd her declaration of september whose importance for her appointment she was not unaware of was false she had at that time deliberately deceived the authority on october the applicant challenged the decisions of january and august before the referring to the grounds of her objection see paragraph above she denied having deceived the relevant land authority and declared that she stood by the statements she had made on november in answer to the charge that she had failed to repudiate the kpd s policies her reply was that she could not do so because she did not know what they were she had merely praised its work in setting up a kindergarten in north furthermore her involvement in this matter dated from august she could not therefore be accused of wilfully misleading the authority on may on september she had been questioned about her accommodation in when she had been studying there she had not felt under any obligation to give an account of her support for the kindergarten if she had wished to deceive the authority she would not have published her letter as it was she had thought that under the constitutional order she had a right to carry on and support legitimate and laudable activities even if they were encouraged by a party which the government in power deemed to be opposed to the constitution glasenapp supplemented her pleadings on december she stressed that she did not unreservedly bedenkenlos support the kpd she had merely helped together with members of that party to set up a people s kindergarten in she pointed out that she believed she was entitled under the free democratic constitutional system not to make statements without cause she was willing to answer questions concerning the kpd s practical objectives but it was unreasonable to expect her to inform herself of the party s aims then consider whether they were compatible with the constitution and dissociate herself from them the administrative court dismissed her claim on july considering that she did not afford the guarantee required by section of the land civil servants act that she would at all times uphold the free democratic constitutional system it was undisputed and a matter of common knowledge that the former german communist party the kpd banned by the federal constitutional court together with the present party of the same name still tolerated in the federal republic apparently for reasons of foreign policy and the other communist groups whether they followed the moscow line or not sought to set up the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the working class admittedly some west european communist parties had recently abandoned the expression dictatorship and proclaimed their attachment to democracy but experience in eastern europe showed that this was merely an electoral tactic under the basic law and the system in the federal republic of germany freedom of each individual citizen and of the state was the highest value to be protected but it did not exist where communists were in control a communist form of government was incompatible with the basic law a candidate for a civil-service post was clearly not upholding the free democratic system within the meaning of the basic law if he belonged to a communist group if he was not a member of such an organisation or if his membership could not be proved but he worked for it or for similar ends he did not afford a guarantee that he would uphold the system in mrs. glasenapp s case the land authority concerned had initially reached the conclusion on the basis of her statements on may and september that she afforded the necessary guarantee her refusal to dissociate herself from the aims of communism however proved that she was not willing to subscribe to the principles of the free democratic system and to uphold them it was not possible at one and the same time to support the aims of communism and to support the basic law the one precluded the other the authority was therefore right subsequently to regard the applicant s declaration as an admission of support for communism and its aims the applicant had admittedly said that she did not know what the policies of the kpd were but in view of her level of education and the campaign by a section of the press against the decree on the employment of political extremists in the civil service see paragraph above she could not be believed nor could the court accept her claim that she had supported and wished to support the kpd only in order to establish the kindergarten her letter in the rote fahne on october gave the clear impression that she was trying to avoid not being thought of as a communist in the most characteristic passage that is not the case she denied that she was dissociating herself from communism or its policies there was nothing to suggest that she did not already approve of the aims of communism at the time she applied for the appointment by concealing her true opinions she had deliberately deceived the authority which was therefore bound to dismiss her under section of the land civil servants act mrs. glasenapp appealed against this judgment on august filing her grounds of appeal on december and january she argued inter alia that there was no proof that she had given false information or concealed the real facts and thus deceived the relevant land authority as required by the federal constitutional court in such cases judgment of may see paragraph above it was for the appropriate authority to establish that there had been a specific breach of the duty at all times to uphold the free democratic system in this connection the expression of a given conviction could not be taken into account so long as it amounted merely to a criticism of the present state of society or sought to change existing legislation by constitutional means even if the impugned letter was regarded as evidence of a lack of loyalty to the constitution regard should have been had to the fact that the applicant had not engaged in anti-constitutional activities and that her personal conduct left nothing to be desired the seriousness of her professions of loyalty could therefore not be doubted nor could her refusal to dissociate herself from the policies of communism which were in any case far from clear even assuming that one could speak of the policies of communism be doubted or be taken for an anti-constitutional activity because she was not a member of the kpd and not familiar with its policies she considered that she could and should support what she felt to be a laudable enterprise irrespective of what a political party said about it and that she could do so lawfully even if her opinion on a particular matter was the same as a communist s in short the authority had not established that there had been wilful deceit moreover the judgment had contravened various principles in the codes of administrative procedure and civil procedure in that it relied exclusively on the terms of the letter without taking into account the further explanation of their meaning given during the proceedings finally neither the applicant s conduct in connection with the kindergarten project nor her reaction to the articles in the press could be complained of as anti-constitutional nor could her refusal to dissociate herself from the policy of the kpd warrant that conclusion if the principles adopted by the were applied the land administrative court of appeal dismissed the appeal on april it held that the authority was right to consider that the applicant s appointment had been obtained by wilful deceit the declarations of may and september were not true they were irreconcilable with the content of the letter admittedly the letter referred to the matter of the kindergarten but the applicant s support for the kpd had not stopped there on the contrary she had stated that she supported the party s policies without expressing any reservations such support however was incompatible with a profession of loyalty to the free democratic system that was clear from kpd manifestos and the policy statements of some of its leaders the kpd rejected the parliamentary system enshrined in the basic law its aim was social revolution and as an avant-garde working-class organisation it sought to bring about social revolution by force in order to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat its objective as stated in its programme was the march towards the revolutionary fusion of the working class and the people towards destruction of the capitalist system and exploitation towards the establishment of the absolute power of the working class towards socialism and the classless society and towards communism as the governing class was not prepared to yield to the advancement of the proletariat it was necessary to bring it down by using revolutionary force the ends and means of the kpd accordingly ran counter to essential principles of the free democratic system the kpd s first aim was the destruction of the state it strove to achieve power not by the means afforded by the constitution but by revolutionary force the dictatorship of the proletariat which was its objective was contrary to the principles of the basic law such as the sovereignty of the people plurality of political parties equal opportunity for all political parties and the right to oppose those in power within the limits imposed by the constitution given the contrast between mrs. glasenapp s professions of loyalty and her letter published in the rote fahne it had to be supposed that objectively she had been lying in may and september her letter which was written on her own initiative and not under any pressure indicated her true position whereas the need to confirm her allegiance to the constitution in order to secure her appointment could have led her to make a declaration which was mere lip service lippenbekenntnis furthermore the applicant was aware that her statements were untrue having regard to her level of education it could be presumed that she had directed her mind to the effects of her letter which was addressed to at least a section of the public it was incomprehensible that after having stated publicly and in writing her agreement with the kpd on two matters she should have claimed to her employing authority dienstherr that she did not know what the kpd s policies were in this connection her behaviour at the interview on november appeared particularly revealing if out of over-eagerness or without thinking she had included statements in her letter which on mature reflection she no longer entirely approved of she could easily have rectified the letter the explanation she offered on this point see paragraphs and above was too far removed from the actual wording of her letter the employing authority was therefore entitled to ask her how she claimed to resolve the conflict civil servants duty of political loyalty required them to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups which attacked opposed and defamed the state its lawful institutions and the existing constitutional system if mrs. glasenapp really was ignorant of the details of the kpd s policies when she wrote her letter she could have said so at the same time she could have admitted that she had gone too far in not wishing to dissociate herself from the party and its policies and in supporting the latter she could for example have said that she was in fact merely engaged in supporting the kindergarten venture instead of that she had given the employing authority a reply not calculated to throw light on the position and she had made no further reply to the substance of the letter which the authority sent her on november the court of appeal drew the conclusion that at least the statements of september which reiterated those of may had been knowingly false the applicant was well aware that her declarations of loyalty to the constitution were of decisive importance for her appointment as a probationary civil servant her appeal must therefore be dismissed the court of appeal refused the applicant leave to apply to the bundesverwaltungsgericht for review on points of law on june mrs. glasenapp applied to the same court of appeal to have the latter decision set aside she argued that her case raised a question of principle of vital importance for the uniform interpretation and application of the law article and of the code of administrative procedure all the decisions in her case had been based on her refusal to dissociate herself from the policy of the kpd the question was therefore whether it was allowable to draw adverse inferences from such conduct there were conflicting authorities on the point unlike the court of appeal the augsburg administrative court and the bremen labour court of appeal landesarbeitsgericht together with most legal writers considered that it was not permissible to question candidates about their political opinions or their membership of political parties they inferred therefrom that the relevant authorities could not rely on replies to such questions or on the refusal to reply when the court of appeal found against her on july mrs. glasenapp applied for legal aid to bring an appeal beschwerde in the that court refused her application on december on the grounds that the proposed appeal had insufficient prospects of success it did not consider it necessary to decide whether the question raised by the applicant involved a matter of principle because in the instant case it would have been necessary to determine whether a wilful deceit had been practised on the relevant authority in the circumstances however the authority had been entitled to ask mrs. glasenapp to clarify her position in relation to the kpd and the court of appeal could regard her negative reaction as evidence that in may she had knowingly made a false statement whose importance for her appointment could not have escaped her on january the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the she relied on article right of access to the civil service article right to free choice of one s profession article non-discrimination and article right to free development of the personality of the basic law she argued that there was no evidence of wilful deceit the decisions complained of were all expressly based on her refusal to distance herself from the policies of the kpd she had however clearly dissociated herself from them by pointing out that by her letter she neither had wished nor could have wished to express support for the kpd generally but only for the opening of a people s kindergarten in north admittedly she had not agreed to repudiate the kpd s policies but that did not justify drawing unfavourable inferences in particular because the declaration in question had been made six months before her letter such a far-reaching obligation to dissociate oneself from a party s policies could not exist in any case she had not joined the kpd and accordingly she could not judge its programme and aims in its judgment of may see paragraph above the constitutional court had held that membership of a party opposed to the basic law was merely one relevant factor when it came to considering an application for a civil-service post the court required each case to be considered on its merits however it was not admissible to question a candidate about his political opinions or his connections with a party or to use the answers given to such questions it also appeared from this judgment and a series of decisions by other courts that even the members of a party whose aims were inimical to the constitution were not required to disapprove of its objectives in their entirety this principle should apply a fortiori to non-members the measure complained of had not taken these considerations into account in requiring the applicant to disavow the kpd s policies completely the authority in question had made an absurd demand and had not complied with the principles laid down in the matter by the courts sitting as a panel of three judges the decided on july not to entertain the constitutional complaint on the ground that it had insufficient prospects of success in so far as the competent courts had considered that the applicant s behaviour amounted to wilful deceit their assessments and conclusions were not arbitrary the rule that a civil servant s appointment must be annulled in such a case was not contrary to the principle of equal access to the civil service article of the basic law nor had there been a breach of the other rights claimed by the applicant admittedly it was forbidden under article of the basic law to prejudice a person on account of his political opinions that however did not mean that deliberately deceptive conduct which misled an appointing authority was protected by the constitution nor did the right secured in article of the basic law extend to maintaining rights acquired in such a manner mrs. glasenapp s application was lodged with the commission on november she complained of the revocation of her provisional appointment as a secondary-school teacher relying on article of the convention taken together with article art the commission declared the application admissible on december in its report adopted on may article art the commission expressed the opinion by nine votes to eight that there had been a breach of article art the full text of the commission s opinion and of the separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment at the hearing on october the government requested the court to find i that it can not deal with the merits of the case as the application is incompatible with the provisions of the convention alternatively ii that it can not deal with the merits of the case owing to the failure to exhaust domestic remedies also alternatively iii that the federal republic of germany has not violated the european convention on human rights the government had made the same final submissions in their memorial of march but in a different order the delegate

inspector the article continued with information concerning the detained person and the ongoing investigation into the homicide it quoted the investigator s statement that it was possible that the suspect had been acting under commission which according to the applicant implied the possibility of a contract killing the article was illustrated by a photograph apparently taken in the vicinity of the crime scene next to the article there was a separate information column concerning k.u. s previous conviction for economic crimes and his academic achievements under a heading who the column reproduced a photograph of k.u. taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis on the same date the same information was published in the other evening newspaper iltalehti in the form of an interview given by k.u on april the public prosecutor preferred charges against the applicant and h.s. the newspaper s editor-in-chief at the time in his indictment the prosecutor maintained that by writing and allowing publication of the above article the applicant and h.s had given false information about k.u in a manner that had been conducive to causing him suffering and damage and to subjecting him to contempt and that they had also disparaged him in other ways the prosecutor did not allege that the information imparted in the article had been false as such but contended inter alia that the combination of large headings with question marks the text of the article the photographs of k.u and his personal profile had aimed to insinuate to the readership that k.u might have had a motive to commission the killing k.u. for his part requested that the applicant and h.s be punished and claimed compensation for suffering and legal costs in the same proceedings he contended that the defendants had unlawfully connected him with murder in finland s largest evening newspaper the use of his photograph taken at the public defence of his doctoral thesis had added to his suffering as he was thus defamed as an academic which was to be his future career according to k.u. the worst part of the criminal act had been the combination of the heading and his photograph and the image thus created in the minds of those people who had not read the article itself the defendants had sought to profit by their act in addition to the permanent stigma k.u maintained that the offence had brought shame and distress to his family the applicant and h.s contested the charge and the civil claims their main arguments were the following the article did not contain any false information nor could it have disparaged k.u or caused him suffering the latter point was highlighted by the fact that k.u had himself given an interview concerning the same matter to another evening newspaper published on the same date the article concerned a criminal investigation of general interest and was based on information given by the authorities k.u was a public figure and his connection with p.o had been an issue of general interest and significance in itself by pressing charges the prosecutor had unnecessarily interfered with the defendants freedom of expression protected by the constitution and article of the convention when heard in person at the district court s oral hearing h.s submitted inter alia that k.u had contacted him after the article had been published he had been very hurt and upset h.s had then offered him the possibility of rectification according to the documents k.u had turned down that offer on august the helsinki district court käräjäoikeus tingsrätten issued its judgment it convicted the applicant and h.s of defamation pursuant to chapter article paragraph point of the penal code the applicant was sentenced to day-fines amounting to a total of euros eur she was also ordered to pay k.u. jointly and severally with h.s. eur for suffering and eur in legal costs in its reasons the court noted that it had to examine the conflicting interests of freedom of expression and the right to privacy referring to sections and of the constitution and article of the convention it also made reference to the supreme court precedent no where that court found that the freedom of expression did not justify violation of a person s honour or private life in assessing the article written by the applicant the court found as follows it is undisputed that in the summer of k.u was a public figure it is also undisputed that the article did not contain factual errors thus each piece of information contained therein was accurate the district court has to assess whether the article included such insinuations that have been conducive to causing suffering or contempt or if it was disparaging in other aspects the article covered the pre-trial investigation of a homicide which had taken place a few days earlier as well as another large-scale case concerning economic crime already pending before the prosecutor the same person had been the victim of the homicide and one of the suspects in the economic offences k.u had known the victim of the homicide and was also one of the suspects in the case concerning economic offences the defendants have pleaded inter alia that the newspaper had been obliged to report on crime the article had emphasised the connection between k.u and the victim of the homicide in the district court s view no such circumstances have emerged in these proceedings which would have linked the fact that k.u had known the victim of the homicide to his public activities nor has it been established that the fact that k.u knew the victim had been of general interest or that this piece of news had had such significance to society that it had been important to publish it. the district court concluded the most central topics of the article had been the connection with the victim of the homicide and k.u suspicions of economic offences organised crime and a possible contract killing the use of the heading ‘ the victim of the vantaa homicide had connections with k.u along with the background information on k.u under a title ‘ who illustrated with his photograph had personified the whole article to k.u although the heading of the article carried a question mark and the first paragraph in the text mentioned that the victim might italics added here have had connections with k.u the text does not provide an immediate answer to that question nor does it state clearly that the victim and k.u had known each other only from other circumstances the article had left the answers open as the text dealt with the connection between the victim of the homicide and k.u and at the end a possible contract killing k.u had also been connected with a contract killing connecting a person groundlessly with a contract killing violates his honour by combining information received and statements given by the head of the investigation and by mixing two different criminal investigations the article has given an ambiguous picture of the connection between those cases the headings and the information concentrating on k.u s personal profile had made k.u the main common feature of the crimes the district court finds that in the article k.u had been linked with a homicide in a manner that insinuated a connection between k.u and the commission of the homicide and a contract killing such an insinuation violates k.u. s honour and has caused him suffering. the district court was composed of one professional judge and three lay judges one of the lay judges was in favour of an acquittal in his dissenting opinion he stressed the fact that all the information presented in the article had been accurate in his view the mere fact that a party to the case his family or friends were shocked about the news coverage or that the readers of a newspaper were not fully able to comprehend the text could not constitute defamation the applicant and h.s appealed against the judgment to the helsinki court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätten relying mainly on their previous arguments they also contested the lower court s interpretation of the law on november the court of appeal upheld the district court s judgment in its reasoning the appellate court reiterated that giving false information or making false insinuations about another person in a manner conducive to causing damage or suffering to that person or subjecting that person to contempt constituted defamation as set out in chapter article paragraph point of the penal code it referred to the relevant government bill for the amendment of that provision he vp in stating that it was characteristic of that offence to concern false factual information or a false insinuation bearing a close resemblance to factual information in principle the veracity of an argument may be reviewed afterwards if an argument is accurate or if the insinuation concerns a fact the act may nevertheless be punishable as defamation under point of the provision if the information is given or insinuation made with a view to disparaging another person deliberately the court then found that it is undisputed that the information in the article published in ilta-sanomat on july concerning two different criminal matters was accurate as such the common feature of those matters has been the fact that k.u and the victim of the homicide had been suspects in one of the criminal cases mentioned in the article the headings of the article the text and the photographs of k.u on the cover and on the article have however created a connection falsely implying that k.u was somehow involved in the homicide the heading of the article and its tone were such that the fact that k.u was not strictly speaking an accomplice to the homicide only became clear on reading through the article more closely it followed that chapter article paragraph point of the penal code was to be applied in this case as indicated by the district court. the court of appeal went on to assess in detail whether the defendants conduct could be regarded as intentional the court found that the applicant was a professional journalist and that she must have considered it probable that her article contained a false insinuation and that this false insinuation was capable of causing suffering reaching thus an affirmative conclusion the court found no reason to deviate from the outcome of the lower court s judgment

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a cypriot national mrs eleni foka the applicant on july the applicant was represented by mr c. triantafyllides a lawyer practising in and by mr c. greenwood professor at the department of law of the of economics the turkish government the government were represented by their agent mr z.m necatigil the applicant alleged that she had been subjected to ill-treatment and unlawful deprivation of liberty she also complained of an infringement of her rights under articles and of the convention and of having been persecuted because of her ethnic origin and political opinions the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no by a decision of november the court declared the application admissible the applicant and the government each filed further written observations rule in addition third-party comments were received from the government of cyprus which had exercised its right to intervene article of the convention and rule b the respondent government replied to those comments rule the applicant was born in and currently lives in at the material time she was living alone in her family house in the village of ayia triada yialloussa in the karpas region of northern she was a teacher at the greek-cypriot elementary school in that village the parties disagree as to the facts of the case in december the applicant went to spend the christmas holidays with members of her family in southern on january she was transported by a red cross bus with other enclaved greek-cypriots to the ledra palace crossing point in from there they were due to be taken to ayia triada by a bus driven by a turkish settler at the barricade which was guarded by turkish and/or turkish republic of northern trnc police and customs officers the applicant and the other five or six enclaved greek-cypriot women who were on the bus with her were searched when the customs officers asked to search the applicant again she refused claiming that she had already been searched and nothing had been found she was then taken to a small room near the barricade and was told that she would be searched by police officers the applicant continued to refuse to submit to another search the officials then tried to force the applicant into a small private car she resisted and started shouting the officials covered her mouth with their hands and started hitting her on her arms and feet in order to force her into the car they pushed her in the car headfirst and then took hold of her legs they managed to put her in the car with her legs upwards and feet pointing towards the roof she was subsequently taken to a building that appeared to be a police station there her bag was thoroughly searched and whenever she tried to see what the officers were doing she was hit on the head and shoulders by a person whom she was able to identify from the discussions held among the officials present as a member of the turkish secret service she was then taken to an adjacent room where she was interrogated and mocked when the interrogation was over the bag was returned to her empty the officers also kept part of her money pounds cyp of the cyp she had on her afterwards the officers took her in the same car to the bus that would have taken her to ayia triada as she did not feel well she asked to be allowed to return to southern however the officers started to hit her once again and forced her into the bus one of the women on the bus told them to let her go or you will kill her upon her return to ayia triada the applicant asked to be taken to a female turkish-cypriot doctor in nearby yialoussa but her request was refused the next day a greek-cypriot took the applicant to the above-mentioned doctor the doctor offered her medical treatment but refused to certify the existence of bruises on her body during the nights that followed stones were thrown at her house on january the applicant was visited at the by representatives of doctors of the world to whom she showed the bruises she had on her legs hands and head in its relevant parts the report of doctors of the world reads as follows although eleni foka knew we were coming and had agreed to meet us nevertheless when she first saw us she became very nervous her respiration increased and she seemed to have trouble breathing we reassured her that we had come from doctors of the world but it still took her about minutes to be able to speak normally the first thing she did somewhat frantically was to show us the bruises up and down her legs which she received she says as a result of being beaten by the police at the time of our visit she said the beating had occurred over one week ago she also said the police were from the neighbouring town of only two kilometres away from sipahi she claims that the reason she was beaten is that she had tried to bring across the border some textbooks for the children and some religious crosses after having visited relatives on the greek side of over the christmas holidays she claims she was detained beaten interrogated many times and released approximately hours later she also claims that she is experiencing a lot of pain in the back of her head her neck and her lower back as a result of this beating she says that the police came from the station of jalousa and systematically harass her they often arrive in the village and either follow her or simply walk around in what she interprets as an attempt to intimidate her and others who might have rebellious thoughts or want to help her she claims the police keep her under constant surveillance. a week later a representative of the united nations peacekeeping force in cyprus unficyp visited the applicant and reported that she had bruises and blood stains on her shins and thighs on january a medical officer of unficyp was denied permission to visit the applicant the officer was eventually granted permission on january accordingly the medical officer visited the applicant and examined her on january the applicant appended a note to the file in this respect by the humanitarian branch of the headquarters of unficyp dated february this note read as follows on the humanitarian branch was informed by the office of the presidential commissioner for humanitarian affairs that e.ph was ill treated and arrested by tkcyp police when crossing to the north on after a week s stay in the south and that a team of the doctors of the world has visited her in ay trias on to question her about her mistreatment on the same day hum o. sector and the interpreter visited e. ph in the school as requested by cho she stated that she was beaten by hand from tcpe in the office at ledra chpt and another office somewhere in on the head neck and back she said that on about hrs a team of persons male doctors lawyer and one official from a presidential palace not nearer described has been visiting her she gave the same statement to them as nwp and showed bruises and blood effusions on shin bones and thighs as she did to nwp the team of the doctors of the world left her after minutes and they used the english language only while speaking to mrs e. ph nwp then proceeded to yialusha pol station for further clarification all tcpe officers however were very reluctant in answering nwp questions and very reserved on january afternoon un personnel from the lp in leonarisso has been sent to tcpe yialusha to inform that sho accompanied by medical officers sec intends to visit e. ph again in order to have her injuries examined however permission was not granted at that stage cho tasked austcivpol to investigate and liaise with tkcyp police at nic hq in order to get permission for the medical exam ‘ clearance was granted on and the message relayed to hum cell sector to set up the examination on the following day which was then carried out successfully see med rep. smo sec dated plus attached note of sho investigation on the confiscated items is still ongoing by austcivpol. the applicant claimed that she had been under constant surveillance by the local police and subjected to further harassment including threats that she would be forcibly expelled from northern or killed in a letter dated august the applicant s lawyer informed the court that in may the applicant had needed to seek urgent medical treatment in southern however the applicant had then not been allowed by the turkish military and the trnc authorities to return to her home and property in ayia triada and had therefore been living in nicosia ever since on december the applicant along with two other teachers from the karpas elementary school and nine students crossed over to southern cyprus via the checkpoint two days later the group flew to on an excursion organised by the greek-cypriot and/or greek authorities for a few days in order to take part in various anti-turkish campaigns that received considerable publicity on january at about p.m. the applicant who was returning from southern to northern cyprus was subjected to routine police and immigration control by turkish-cypriot officials at the checkpoint when the officers asked the applicant if she had anything to declare she said she did not when they asked her to give them her handbag for search purposes she refused to do so thus preventing the officers from executing their duties and committing an offence under trnc laws section of the customs and excise law no of when a female police officer arrived the applicant continued to resist she was then requested to accompany the officials to the lefkoşa police headquarters saray önü for further examination she once again resisted and started kicking and shouting that she did not recognise any legal authority in northern subsequently she was led to a police car she refused to get into the car and stated that she wanted to return to southern she was then driven to police headquarters the turkish cypriot police used only force that was reasonable and necessary the applicant may have caused injury to herself in an effort to resist the body search and efforts to take her to the police station this was not evident however as she was wearing thick dark stockings once at the police headquarters the applicant continued to act irrationally resisting the police officers and pushing them away eventually a female police officer searched her handbag she found six silver necklaces and four gold crosses items that were subject to customs duty and that the applicant had refused to declare the applicant agreed to pay the equivalent of turkish liras as customs duty and/or fine furthermore various other items were found in her bag such as books and brochures it was considered that these contained anti-turkish racist and defamatory material liable to incite racial hatred and aggravate inter-communal relations the authorities then attempted to carry out a body search which the applicant resisted the applicant attacked the female customs officer who called for police assistance during the body search radio-cassettes were found hidden inside the applicant s clothing the authorities kept all the items for the purposes of further examination the applicant was detained only for a transitory period to enable completion of the search under more appropriate circumstances and to calm her down she was not under arrest during this period and was offered refreshments which she refused to take having paid the fine the applicant returned to

organisation of cypriot fighters eoka movement and to those killed in terrorist activities carried out against the british the other articles contained propaganda and a map of showing the border area

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a hungarian national ms judit szima the applicant on april the applicant was represented by mr a.i molnár a lawyer practising in the hungarian government the government were represented by mr z. tallódi co-agent ministry of public administration and justice the applicant complained under article of the convention that her conviction for some statements she had published on the internet had amounted to a breach of her right to freedom of expression especially in view of the fact that she could not prove the truth about the impugned allegations on november the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the applicant was born in and lives in szekszárd the applicant a retired senior police officer was at the material time the chairperson of tettrekész police trade union between may and july she published a number of writings on the trade union s website which was effectively under her editorial control concerning outstanding remunerations due to police staff alleged nepotism and undue political influence in the force as well as dubious qualifications of senior police staff the applicant was indicted for instigation to insubordination on april the military bench of the found her guilty as charged and sentenced her to a fine and demotion the court did not sustain the applicant s defence according to which the publication of such allegations belonged to the core of a trade union s activities it held that those allegations were capable of causing insubordination and as such were hardly or not at all susceptible to any proof of their veracity the based its judgment inter alia on the following statements published by the applicant on the internet the staff are regularly required to work overtime without remuneration for years clearly due allowances have not been paid to low-ranking staff currently it is almost a prerequisite of becoming a senior police officer to have a political background or to be a relative or a descendant of other senior police officers. the senior police officers obvious violations of the law set a bad example for the force. this is typical of senior police officers they commit violations and infringements and then if we point this out their reaction is striking back without any principles suing and accusing of incitement in order to counter our suggestions to renew and clean up the force. why are we wondering at the infringements of police officers if law-breaking and tyrannising senior police officers go unpunished the uninhibited infringements of the law committed by senior police officers placing themselves above the law go unpunished and what is more they are even decorated when on order of the political authority in power thousands tens of thousands of discontented and underprivileged people are beaten by jaded police officers on the streets. the ‘ tettrekész police trade union commiserates with those hungarian citizens whose human dignity and human rights were violated and affronted by acts of a prostituted leadership and of our criminal ‘ colleagues and apologises for that. police staff are getting more and more underprivileged and humiliated by their own leaders. some senior police officers are active in trying to obtain that average citizens be punished rather than ‘ served and protected by the police officers on the streets. some well-paid senior police officers unprofessionally incite ordinary citizens and police officers against each other. we constantly request the review of the often unprofessional selection procedure of senior police officers but to no avail because there is apparently no need for a citizen-friendly police. the senior police officers again demonstrated that they were incapable of upholding the public order in a party-neutral and politically neutral way it is proven again that the hungarian police s primary objective is first and foremost not to maintain public order for the taxpaying citizens but to uphold the reign of current political leaders who have led hungary into economic and moral distress. the reputation of the police has reached previously unseen depths because of the acts of the unprofessional and anti-national senior police officers non-complying with the spirit of the police oath. it is obvious that the police s core leadership is in an unacceptable way politically committed to the government of the country and that of the capital. the head of the national police department is demonstrating every day that he is much more able to write obscene poems than to lead the police moreover he is considerably much better in being an obstacle to the work of ‘ tettrekész police trade union and in managing a police pop band than in cooperating with a representative trade union of the police with the highest number of police officer members. a chaotic and highly unprofessional leadership is ruining the rest of the police s reputation from day to day. on december the military bench of the budapest court of appeal upheld the applicant s conviction under section of the criminal code it held that the publication of the documents by the applicant had gone beyond her freedom of expression given the particularities of the armed body to which she belonged in the court s opinion the views contained in

met the prince their intimate relationship their feelings and the manner in which the prince had reacted to the news of ms coste s pregnancy and had behaved towards the child at his birth and subsequently the relevant passages of this interview were the following paris match p.m. when did you meet albert of monaco nicole coste n.c. eight years ago on a nice to paris flight before landing he asked for my telephone number two weeks later i had a message on my mobile he wanted to invite me to monaco i went there the following weekend we spent a very tender night next to each other it was very romantic after that weekend he called me to say that he had had a very pleasant time and that he wanted to see me again as the months went by i fell very much in love i spent weekends in monaco he took me everywhere with him when he didn t have official duties i had the impression that something was happening he didn t speak about his feelings but i heard his heart beating there are signs that can t be mistaken when you re in someone s arms he didn t say anything to me and i didn t ask him anything but he had tender looks and gestures towards me even in public and even in front of other young women i think that he appreciated my affection he told his friends that i was very very loving and that he liked my maternal side for my part i found him touching m. did you meet up often c. for the first five years i went to monaco about once a month sometimes he took me along to official events such as the world music awards or tennis tournaments m. did you ever meet his father prince rainier c. yes at a dinner with about twenty guests albert told me that we couldn t go along together since his father would be there in the afternoon he indirectly made me his loveliest declaration of love by saying to a friend in front of everyone ‘ take good care of nicole i am very fond of her. and he kissed me m. what did he tell you about his talk with his father c. we spoke about it the next day i found him strange i became worried ‘ i ve been thinking he said ‘ i believe it s better if we stay friends. m. how did you react c. i was crying i telephoned him to find out if it was really over ‘ if you were in my situation what would you do he answered ‘ i would wait not for long but i would wait m. one has the feeling that albert s discussion with his father was a turning point in your relationship c. it s true the relationship deteriorated after that at the same time however he seemed to be afraid of taking a decision he hesitated taking one step forward and two steps back albert is not someone who expresses his feelings or who argues he has a good sense of humour i had the impression that he still had feelings we saw each other with more or less the same frequency but for less time one day instead of three i had the impression that he was afraid of becoming too attached in december i wanted us to celebrate my birthday together he suggested that i come to monaco we went out for a drink there were lots of young women coming up to him and i let him know that i wasn t happy about that on returning to the flat we became lovers again something that i didn t want that night the evening had annoyed me m. was it then that you became pregnant c. yes neither he nor i had planned it i was taking precautions when i saw albert on december i had sore breasts i said to him ‘ if i m pregnant what are we going to do he replied ‘ if you re pregnant you must keep it he said it from the heart he immediately began thinking of boys names and i was coming up with girls names since i already had two boys he said ‘ i m trying to think of boys names that s all you know how to make shortly afterwards i had a positive pregnancy test i wanted him to take a decision very quickly i was well aware of what a child represented for albert given his position in my opinion it was for him to decide he said to me ‘ keep it i ll look after things you won t lack for anything i don t promise to marry you but keep him and don t worry i ll bring him into the family little by little i d like us to keep the news to ourselves for the moment the only person i must tell is my adviser and childhood friend whom you know well. m. did he contact you for news during your pregnancy c. from time to time he spoke to me very kindly then one day he came to see me in paris with his adviser i was three months pregnant he seemed to have changed his mind but as far as i was concerned it was too late the adviser said to me ‘ do you realise that if it s a boy they ll use that to prevent albert acceding to the throne and the child will be able to claim the throne i was surprised that he was going into things that were only details for me i wasn t even thinking about these questions it is clear to me that a child born outside marriage can not accede to the throne m. what happened next c. i learned that i was expecting a boy i was very worried i asked him if it would make things difficult if it was a boy ‘ no no more than if it were a girl. he put his hand on my stomach and we discussed names again when i was five-and-a-half months pregnant i called him he didn t behave the way he usually did with me i understood that something had happened and that he wanted to end the relationship he said ‘ i ve thought it through i ve asked for advice the child is impossible i went to see a lawyer who alerted albert s lawyer albert called me immediately and was very annoyed ‘ you ve trapped me he spoke to me as though he had been brainwashed i was eight months pregnant and had become pregnant six years after our first meeting i would have had multiple opportunities to become pregnant m. how was the birth c. august is not my happiest memory i was very alone on the day i left hospital i was visited by a french laboratory approved by the swiss forensic institute for a dna swab from my son that was organised by his adviser my two older children still didn t know who their little brother s father was alexandre was sleeping in my bedroom in a crib he suffered from asthma and was hospitalised for six weeks i had to deal with this alone with no one to confide in m. when did he see alexandre for the first time c. two and a half months after his birth the most important thing for me was that alexandre be recognised it was out of the question that my child would not have a father that is how i explained it to them for me non-recognition would have been the only basis for taking things to court it was up to albert to organise things so that this little baby had a more or less normal life even if at the very beginning it had been necessary to hide him but i didn t want him to grow up like mazarine for example i thought only about that and not for a second about the fact that he represented a potential heir meanwhile albert was paying me a sum every three months that i still receive m. what happened subsequently c. as i didn t really trust my lawyer any longer i contacted another one to whom i explained that the only thing that counted was that albert recognise his son in my opinion non-recognition of a child amounts to denying him his roots m. did albert realise how important it was for you that he recognise this child c. ultimately yes to my great joy on december he arranged to meet me at a notary s office with his adviser m. what happened during the meeting at the notary s office c. albert signed the deed of recognition he did it out of respect for me while giving instructions that this deed was not to be transcribed in the official register until after his father s death m. do you have a copy of this deed of recognition c. i wasn t given any papers i only have the registration number of the deed i asked the notary several times for a certificate stating that he had a document concerning my son i was told ‘ later after rainier s funeral i contacted the notary again asking that albert s undertaking be upheld and that the official recognition of our son s paternity be entered in the register of births and deaths again the notary told me that it could wait i again asked for a copy of the deed he refused m. what about your flat did you finally move c. i found a house in april and work is currently being carried out on it m. to whom does it belong c. to a property investment company an sci of the shares are in alexandre s name m. what contact have you had with albert since seeing him at the notary s office to sign the deed recognising your son c. i wanted him to see his son regularly and also to call for news of him he has done that during one of his visits i said ‘ just because we ve had a child that doesn t mean that everything has to end between us he replied ‘ for the moment i prefer that we end things because if we continue we ll end up with a second child m. why have you decided to speak out c. i ve already given you some reasons i want alexandre to grow up normally with a father i want the lies to stop for my part i m fed up with lying hiding and passing for the mistress of his friends on account of this silence i no longer have an identity and i live almost like an outlaw i m afraid for my son s psychological health i should like to have him baptised as soon as possible with a correctly drawn up birth certificate in addition i understand that there are rumours going around about this child and i want the truth to be re-established so that his two older brothers have a dignified image of their mother this interview was illustrated by five photographs of the prince with the child and three of the prince with ms coste in particular a double-page spread pages and consisted in a photograph of the prince holding the child in his arms headlined alexandre ‘ is albert s son says his mother followed by this text a little boy who knows how to say only two words daddy and mummy a little boy who does not seem troubled by the huge gulf between the two cultures from which he comes his name is alexandre a conqueror s name an emperor s name he was born in paris on august his mother asks that he does not grow up clandestinely ‘ like mazarine for that reason she is now disclosing his existence which poses no threat to any republic or any dynasty because in togo the country of his maternal family all children whether or not they are born to lawfully married couples are entitled to an official father for the moment the little boy with black curls isn t interested in knowing whether he is a prince or not his mother just has to lean towards him and he is happy there s already a king in the house him. the photograph was also accompanied by the following captions the new sovereign of monaco had not been known to have any long-term relationship today nicole coste an air hostess whom he met eight years ago claims that they have had a son. he s never been seen smiling like this before prince albert succumbs to alexandre s charm. four photographs of the prince holding the child in his arms were published on pages and and were also accompanied by captions and/or subheadings in particular the caption on page reads gentleness tenderness and patience key words for a prince who loves children and on page the prince has always had a soft spot for children and albert president of the monegasque olympic committee wearing an olympics shirt with alexandre in his arms the following subheading appeared on pages and alexandre at months he is already trying to stand up this is one of his very first meetings with albert he sleeps in his mother s bedroom nicole and her three sons have already moved into a flat in the arrondissement of paris. lastly three photographs of the prince with ms coste were published on pages and the photograph on page was captioned as follows they met on a nice to paris flight nicole was an air hostess she had left lomé in togo eight years previously aged ‘ in my country a father would have obliged his son to recognise his child the photographs on page were subtitled as follows nicole also attended official events in may she was on the prince s right as he received the singer yannick at the monte carlo music awards in left she can be seen in the royal box at the grand prix. on may ms coste issued a statement indicating that she had agreed to give an interview to paris match for publication in the edition of may had carefully reread its wording and had herself handed over the photographs showing the prince with alexandre she specified that she had taken those photographs and that she had taken them with the prince s full consent she issued a further statement indicating that she had handed these photographs over to the media for publication without charge she added that her son had been recognised before a notary that the notarial deed had been signed on december and that it had been agreed on that date that the deed would be sent to the district hall of the arrondissement of paris immediately after prince rainier s death she stated that she had attempted by all amicable means to find a compromise with the prince s lawyer and that it was the fact that the prince had failed to honour his undertaking which had induced her to bring the matter to the public s attention with regard to the media she stated they have merely helped my son and myself to have alexandre officially recognised. on may considering that the publication of the article in paris match interfered with his rights to private life and to protection of his own image the prince brought fixed-date proceedings against the applicants on the basis of article of the convention and articles and of the civil code seeking damages from the publishing company and an order that it publish the court s ruling on the front cover of the magazine and requested that the court s decision be immediately enforceable on june the nanterre tribunal de grande instance the tgi ordered the company hachette filipacchi associés to pay the prince euros eur in non-pecuniary damages it also ordered that details of the judgment be printed on the magazine s entire front cover at the publishing company s expense and on pain of a daily fine under the headline court order against paris match at the request of prince albert ii of monaco the judgment was immediately enforceable the tgi noted in particular that from the front page onwards the magazine had disclosed the prince s paternity outside marriage under the headline albert of monaco alexandre the secret child accompanied by a photograph showing him holding the child it also noted that the article dealt with the issue of the prince having fathered the child over ten pages inside the magazine by means of an interview in which the questions led ms coste to discuss her relationship with the prince the couple s feelings the prince s private life and reactions and the child s recognition before a notary it emphasised that the magazine had deliberately chosen numerous photographs taken in the context of the intimacy of the protagonists private life to illustrate and lend support to the disclosure and that these photographs were accompanied by the magazine s own captions which also referred to the prince s love life and the circumstances in which he met the interviewee analysing his conduct and his reactions to the young woman and the child and speculating as to his feelings with regard to this secret child the tgi held that the entire article including the accompanying photographs fell within the most intimate sphere of love and family life and that it did not concern any debate of general interest it added the claimant s accession to the throne of the principality of monaco did not deprive him of the right to respect for his private life nor of his right to protection of his own image in the face of mere rumours concerning the civil status of a child which could not in any event serve as a legitimate pretext for providing information to a prying and curious public about the lives of public figures their feelings and their private conduct with a view to media coverage in the columns of a newspaper which can not in all seriousness claim to take the place of the courtroom which is where the rights of children are legally defended without prejudice to those of women the disputed article which treats rumours in a sensational manner both in its wording and through the accompanying pictures which are completely irrelevant in that they contribute to the impugned interference with private life amounts to a serious and wilful breach of the claimant s fundamental personality rights the latter having specifically served notice by extrajudicial process on the publishing company to respect those rights on may the applicants appealed against that judgment in a press release of july the prince publicly acknowledged that he was the father of alexandre on july the versailles court of appeal suspended the immediate enforcement of the tgi s judgment with regard to the order to publish the court s judgment on november the versailles court of appeal gave judgment it noted that through the interview with ms coste the impugned article focused on disclosing the birth of the child who was presented as having been born from the intimate relationship between the interviewee and the prince from onwards it also noted that although the latter might already have made a statement recognising the child in a notary s office that is in deliberately chosen conditions of confidentiality by the time that the article was published this statement had not given rise to a note in the margin of the child s birth certificate with the result that his birth and his father s identity remained unknown to the public the court of appeal also stated that a person s affections love life or family life and issues of paternity and maternity came within the sphere of private life and were protected by article of the civil code and article of the convention and that those provisions made no distinction between anonymous persons and public figures whatever their civil political or religious functions it noted however that this principle allowed for an exception whenever the facts disclosed could give rise to a debate on account of their potential impact or consequences given the status or function of the persons concerned in which case the duty to provide information took precedence over respect for private life it reasoned as follows given that the fact of albert grimaldi s fatherhood had never been publicly recognised that the monegasque constitution makes it impossible for a child born out of wedlock to accede to the throne and that albert grimaldi had not consented to the disclosure of his possible paternity of ms coste s child since on may he had indicated to hachette filippachi associés his opposition to the publication of those facts it follows that hachette filipacchi associés deliberately breached the provisions of article of the civil code and of article of the european convention on human rights without being able to justify this offence on the inexistent requirements of current-affairs reporting the legitimacy of the information or its readers right to information which did not include albert grimaldi s secret paternity even if he had become the reigning prince of the principality on his father s death in april this interference in his private sphere in that the article did not merely disclose the existence of a ‘ secret child but also contained numerous digressions derived from ms coste s confessions concerning the circumstances of their meeting the respondent s feelings his most intimate reactions in response to the news of ms coste s pregnancy and his attitude towards the child during private encounters in her flat could not be justified by the concomitant publication of these facts in the magazine bunte or by the media impact caused by the content of the article or by the fact that other publications had subsequently repeated these reports which had become common knowledge through the fault of the publishing company or by the alleged legitimacy of such a disclosure given that the child had no official status which would have rendered his birth and the disclosure of the father s identity a subject which the media and specifically the company hachette filipacchi associés were required as part of their duty to provide information to bring to the public s attention or by the fact that albert grimaldi faced against his will with the media impact of the disclosure of information about his private life that he had intended to keep secret if not confidential has been obliged to provide a public explanation or by the tone of the article which as hachette filipacchi associés irrelevantly specifies was intended to show the respondent in a particularly positive light although the photographs showing the child with the respondent which accompany the article were taken by ms coste with albert grimaldi s consent and although ms coste the only person having parental responsibility for the child handed them over to paris match for publication it remains the case that albert grimaldi did not consent to their being published in support of an article which constitutes an invasion of his privacy with the result that their publication is wrongful the court of appeal concluded that the publication in question had caused the prince irreversible damage in that the fact of his paternity which he had wished to keep secret and which had remained so from the child s birth until publication of the impugned article had suddenly and against his will become public knowledge it considered that the non-pecuniary damage thus caused justified an order for publication of the court ruling as supplementary compensation and that in view of the nature of the breach and the seriousness of its consequences such a measure was not disproportionate to the competing interests involved and on the contrary represented the most adequate redress in the particular circumstances of the case it therefore upheld the judgment under appeal except with regard to the conditions of publication of the court ruling which was no longer to appear under a headline and was to take up only one third of the front cover thus the court of appeal ordered that the lower third of the front cover of the first issue of paris match to be published in the week following service of the judgment was to display a white box containing the following text printed in red letters failing which the applicant company would be fined eur per issue after expiry of that deadline by a judgment of the versailles court of appeal upholding the judgment delivered by the nanterre tribunal de grande instance the company hachette filipacchi associés has been held liable for infringing the privacy and the right to his own image of albert ii of monaco in issue no of the paris match newspaper dated may in an article entitled ‘ albert of monaco alexandre the secret child this statement was published on the front cover of edition no of the magazine dated january under a photograph of the prince the cover bore the headline albert of monaco the truth has been punished which was accompanied by the following commentary paris match disclosed the existence of his son alexandre the courts have punished freedom to impart information we have received support from the international press in reaction to this. in addition the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the court of appeal s judgment in their grounds of appeal they developed the following arguments the disclosure of a ruling sovereign prince s paternity was a news event relating to public life given the functions held by the individual in question and the hereditary nature of the transmission of power in the principality of monaco disclosure of this information was necessary in order to inform the public the publication of observations and digressions alongside the announcement of a news event such as the fact of a sovereign prince s fatherhood was lawful provided that these were innocuous and merely served to put the information into perspective and the publication of photographs taken within the family illustrating the news event described in the article was not such as to interfere with respect for privacy and private life relying on article of the convention and citing the court s case-law the applicants also argued that the public had the right to be informed and that this right extended to information concerning the private life of certain public figures they considered in particular that the court s decision in von hannover v. germany no and echr would have been the reverse had the relevant member of the royal family been as in the present case the prince himself head of the state of monaco in support of this argument they cited krone verlag gmbh co kg v. austria no february which they submitted showed that the fact of being a politician brought an individual exercising that role into the sphere of public life with the attendant consequences they further argued that the court of cassation also recognised the public s right to information including with regard to facts concerning private life even where the individual concerned held no public office lastly they submitted that the primacy of the right to inform and the right to be informed had been established in similar circumstances even where a person s right to their own image was in issue the applicants argued in particular that in a hereditary monarchy the prince s lack of known issue was already a matter of discussion and that the existence of a child was such as to contribute to that discussion they also submitted that the child was a potential heir to the monegasque throne since his father could legitimise him at any time they considered that even if improbable this scenario remained legally possible and could therefore become the subject of a general debate regarding the future of the monegasque monarchy and that in addition the fact that the child was of togolese origin could contribute to a debate of general interest which had the potential to change the image of a particularly conservative principality the applicants also pleaded the very strong ties which they alleged bound the principality of monaco to france they further submitted that the worldwide impact of the contested material including in the most serious and most prestigious newspapers proved that the information disclosed by paris match was such as to contribute to a debate of general interest and that this was not simply an article written to provide entertainment they further argued that the photographs accompanying the article showing the prince with the child or with ms coste illustrated a news event and that they entailed no breach of respect for human dignity since the prince was presented in a positive light they asserted that these photographs had not been taken without the prince s knowledge but by ms coste herself and specified that she had handed them over to paris match for publication voluntarily and without charge lastly they emphasised that the magazine bunte had published an almost identical article in germany on may prior to publication of the impugned article and that the german courts had dismissed the prince s action against that newspaper by a judgment of february the court of cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law on inter alia the following grounds every person whatever his rank birth fortune or present or future functions is entitled to respect for his private life the judgment notes firstly that on the date on which the article was published the child s existence and his descent were unknown to the public and secondly that the principality s constitution rules out the possibility of his accession to the throne since he was born out of wedlock a situation that moreover the company s pleadings did not claim to be a subject of debate in french or monegasque society or of examination in the impugned publication and lastly that the article contained multiple digressions on the circumstances in which ms coste and prince albert met and about their relationship the prince s reactions to the news of the pregnancy and his subsequent attitude towards the child in the light of these findings and considerations the court of appeal correctly noted the lack of any topical news item or any debate on a matter of public interest which would have justified its being reported at the time of the impugned publication on the grounds of legitimate imparting of information to the public moreover the publication of photographs of a person to illustrate subsequent content which amounts to an invasion of his privacy necessarily infringes his right to control of his own image on may after publication of the initial article on may see paragraph above the weekly magazine bunte published another article about the disclosure of the prince s paternity this time accompanied by several photographs showing the prince and the child the prince brought urgent proceedings against the magazine in order to prevent any further publication but his case was dismissed on july by a judgment of the freiburg regional court landgericht upheld on november by the karlsruhe court of appeal oberlandesgericht the freiburg regional court noted in particular that as a figure of contemporary history par excellence the prince had to tolerate the impugned encroachment on his private life given the information value of the report it noted that the veracity of the information published by the magazine with regard to the statements by the child s mother and to the claimant s paternity had not been disputed on any specific point it considered that the publication was not unacceptable in terms of the protection of a person s intimate sphere since the disclosures did not relate to that sphere but to the sphere of private life which was less protected it held that the public s right to information resulted from the claimant s position in society and that the pressure that he might have experienced as a result of those disclosures aimed at obliging him to recognise his child did not prohibit publication but was merely an inevitable consequence of it which he was required to tolerate it noted that the published photographs had been taken with the claimant s agreement in his private sphere and had been made available to the press by a person who had just as much right to do so as the claimant it held that the protection of the claimant s private sphere and his right to his own image had to yield to the freedom of the press on account of the importance of communicating to the public information concerning the claimant s son born out of wedlock and about the child s mother lastly it considered that it was for the mother rather than for the prince who had not recognised the child to decide whether the disclosure of the latter s existence fell within the protected private sphere following the appeal by the prince the court of appeal ordered the magazine not to republish or allow to be published a photograph which had appeared in the may issue of bunte showing the claimant in a moment of intimacy with ms coste however it considered that the issue of a male heir to the prince of monaco a constitutional hereditary monarchy was of decisive importance and that the interest taken in this question not only by the citizens of monaco but also by many persons who lived outside the principality deserved protection and ought not to be superseded by the claimant s interest in securing protection of his private sphere on the ground that the current legal situation allowed only legitimate children to accede to the throne the relevant provisions of the civil code are worded as follows everyone has the right to respect for his private life judges may without prejudice to a right to compensation for the damage sustained order any measures such as seizure attachment and others capable of preventing or causing to cease an interference with a person s privacy in the event of urgency such measures may be ordered in urgent proceedings. any act that causes damage to another shall render the person through whose fault the damage was caused liable to make reparation for it. the relevant passages of article of the constitution of december of the principality of monaco amended by law no of april provide the succession to the throne opened by death or abdication takes place by the direct and legitimate issue of the reigning prince by order of primogeniture with priority given to males within the same degree of kinship in the absence of direct legitimate issue the succession passes to the brothers and sisters of the reigning prince and their direct legitimate descendants by order of primogeniture with priority given to males within the same degree of kinship if the heir who would have acceded by virtue of the preceding paragraphs is deceased or renounced the throne before the succession became open the succession passes to his own direct legitimate descendants by order of primogeniture with priority given to males within the same degree of kinship if the application of the preceding paragraphs does not fill the vacancy of the throne the succession passes to a collateral heir appointed by the crown council upon same advice of the regency council the powers of the prince are temporarily held by the regency council the throne can only pass to a person holding monegasque citizenship on the day the succession opens the relevant passages of resolution on the right to privacy adopted by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe on june read as follows the assembly recalls the current affairs debate it held on the right to privacy during its september session a few weeks after the accident which cost the princess of wales her life on that occasion some people called for the protection of privacy and in particular that of public figures to be reinforced at the european level by means of a convention while others believed that privacy was sufficiently protected by national legislation and the european convention on human rights and that freedom of expression should not be jeopardised in order to explore the matter further the committee on legal affairs and human rights organised a hearing in paris on december with the participation of public figures or their representatives and the media the right to privacy guaranteed by article of the european convention on human rights has already been defined by the assembly in the declaration on mass communication media and human rights contained within resolution as ‘ the right to live one s own life with a minimum of interference in view of the new communication technologies which make it possible to store and use personal data the right to control one s own data should be added to this definition the assembly is aware that personal privacy is often invaded even in countries with specific legislation to protect it as people s private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media the victims are essentially public figures since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales at the same time public figures must recognise that the position they occupy in society in many cases by choice automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy public figures are persons holding public office and/or using public resources and more broadly speaking all those who play a role in public life whether in politics the economy the arts the social sphere sport or in any other domain it is often in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right to freedom of expression which is guaranteed in article of the european convention on human rights that the media invade people s privacy claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures certain facts relating to the private lives of public figures particularly politicians may indeed be of interest to citizens and it may therefore be legitimate for readers who are also voters to be informed of those facts it is therefore necessary to find a way of balancing the exercise of two fundamental rights both of which are guaranteed in the european convention on human rights the right to respect for one s private life and the right to freedom of expression the assembly reaffirms the importance of every person s right to privacy and of the right to freedom of expression as fundamental to a democratic society these rights are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order since they are of equal value however the assembly points out that the right to privacy afforded by article of the european convention on human rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities but also against interference by private persons or institutions including the mass media the assembly believes that since all member states have now ratified the european convention on human rights and since many systems of national legislation comprise provisions guaranteeing this protection there is no need to propose that a new convention guaranteeing the right to privacy should be adopted the declaration of the rights and duties of journalists adopted in munich on and november by the trade unions of journalists from the member states of the european community was endorsed by the international federation of journalists at the istanbul congress in it reads inter alia as follows preamble the right to information to freedom of expression and criticism is one of the fundamental rights of man all rights and duties of a journalist originate from this right of the public to be informed on events and

of the land of lower saxony on june b the fact that she was still a member of the executive committee of the bremen/north lower saxony regional branch of the dkp c the fact that she was still chairperson of the wilhemshaven/friesland local branch of the dkp and d her participation in the dkp 's party congress from to may in hamburg as a party delegate by an order of august the weser-ems regional council notified the applicant that she had been temporarily suspended from her post stating in particular as follows although you knew the views of your superiors and the case-law of the disciplinary courts you have nevertheless over a considerable period of time deliberately violated your duty of oyalty for a permanent civil servant that is anextraordinarily serious breach of duty civil servants whosestatus is founded on a special relationship of trust with thestate and who by taking the oath have vowed to uphold the lawand freedom destroy this basis of trust which is essential forthe continuation of their relationship with their employer dienstverhältnis if they deliberately support a party whoseaims are incompatible with the free democratic constitutionalsystem this is the position in the present case from october mrs vogt was paid only per cent of her salary dienstbezüge before the disciplinary division of the oldenburg administrative court disziplinarkammer des verwaltungsgerichts the applicant who by her own account has been a member of the dkp since argued that her conduct could not amount to a failure to fulfil her duties as a civil servant by being a member of the party and carrying out activities on its behalf she had availed herself of the right of all citizens to engage in political activity she had always carried out such activity within the law and within the limits laid down in the constitution her action to promote peace within the federal republic of germany and in its external relations and her combat against neo-fascism were in no way indicative of an anti-constitutional stance the dkp whose aims had always been wrongly alleged but never proven to be anti-constitutional took part lawfully in the process of forming political opinion in the federal republic of germany lastly according to a report issued by a commission of inquiry of the international labour office on february the institution of disciplinary proceedings against civil servants on account of their political activities on behalf of a party that had not been banned breached international labour organisation ilo convention no concerning discrimination in respect of employment and occupation it also violated article art of the european convention on human rights in its judgment of october the disciplinary division dismissed applications by mrs vogt to have the proceedings stayed and witnesses examined the division ordered that all the charges against mrs vogt be dropped except those concerning her membership as such of the dkp and of the executive committee of the bremen/north lower saxony regional branch her chairing of the wilhelmshaven branch of the dkp and her candidature in the elections to the lower saxony land parliament on june on the merits the disciplinary division held that the applicant had failed to comply with her duty of political loyalty and ordered her dismissal as a disciplinary measure it granted her a sum equivalent to per cent of her pension entitlement at that date to be paid for a six-month period the division found in the first place that neither ilo convention no nor the recommendations made in the commission of inquiry 's report of february constituted a bar to the opening of disciplinary proceedings it considered that active membership of a political party that pursued anti-constitutional aims was incompatible with a civil servant 's duty of political loyalty the dkp 's aims as described in the mannheim programme of october see paragraph below were clearly opposed to the free democratic constitutional system of the federal republic of germany a party could be held to be anti-constitutional even if it had not been banned by the federal constitutional court bundesverfassungsgericht under article para of the basic law grundgesetz see paragraph below through the active role which she played within the dkp the applicant had therefore clearly supported aims that were contrary to the constitution the disciplinary division added that the rule laid down in the first sentence of article para of the basic law see paragraph below according to which no one may be prevented from taking office as a member of parliament could not justify the applicant 's standing as the dkp candidate in regional elections this rule did not apply to measures such as disciplinary proceedings which initially had a different purpose and restricted the freedom to stand for election to and to sit as a member of parliament only as an indirect and unavoidable consequence of their implementation the duty of political loyalty which admittedly restricted civil servants fundamental rights was one of the traditional principles of the civil service and had constitutional status by virtue of article para of the basic law see paragraph below it followed that this duty took precedence over the provisions of international instruments such as the european convention the applicant had moreover carried out her political activities despite being familiar with the case-law establishing that active membership of the dkp was incompatible with the duty of political loyalty she must have been aware at the latest once the lower saxony disciplinary court niedersächsischer disziplinarhof had delivered its judgment of june which was published in an official education-authority circular and was brought to the attention of the applicant in person that her conduct was in breach of her duties pflichtwidriges verhalten mrs vogt had accordingly to be dismissed for having betrayed the relationship of trust between herself and her employer throughout the disciplinary proceedings she had moreover repeatedly indicated that she intended to continue her political activities for the dkp despite the warnings she had received the fact that she had done her work satisfactorily for many years and that she had been held in high regard by her pupils and their parents alike was immaterial the disciplinary division finally ordered that mrs vogt should be paid per cent of her pension allowance for a period of six months it did so in recognition of the fact that apart from her breach of the duty of loyalty mrs vogt had always performed her duties unexceptionably and enthusiastically and needed some income to be protected from immediate hardship on march the applicant lodged an appeal against the above judgment with the lower saxony disciplinary court reiterating her previous arguments see paragraph above in a judgment of october the disciplinary court dismissed mrs vogt 's appeal and upheld the administrative court 's judgment in all respects it pointed out that by carrying out activities on behalf of the dkp the applicant had breached the duty of political loyalty that she owed in accordance with article para of the basic law taken together with section of the lower saxony civil service act under those provisions civil servants must at all times bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the basic law and uphold that system they must unequivocally dissociate themselves from groups who criticise campaign against and cast aspersions on the state its institutions and the existing constitutional system as a result of her activities as a member of the dkp the applicant had failed to satisfy these requirements the dkp 's political aims were incompatible with that system the fact that the constitutional court had not banned the dkp did not prevent other courts from finding that the party was anti-constitutional as the federal administrative court and the disciplinary court itself had done convincingly in judgments of february and july an analysis of the still current mannheim programme made by mies and gerns in their book on the dkp 's methods and objectives weg und ziel der dkp edition showed that the party which aimed to establish a regime similar to that existing in the communist countries around continued to be guided by the principles of marx engels and lenin article para of the basic law and the corresponding legislation of the land of lower saxony securing the right to take office as a member of parliament did not set limits on the duty of political loyalty since those provisions were not applicable to impediments resulting from disciplinary proceedings the court held that the applicant 's reference to article para of the basic law which secured the right to freedom of expression was not relevant as the provisions governing the civil service mentioned in article para of the basic law had to be regarded as general laws within the meaning of article para of the basic law see paragraph below similarly the european court of human rights had ruled that a decision by a competent authority relating to admission to the civil service did not amount to an interference with freedom of expression the same approach applied in cases where a person had already been appointed to a permanent civil service post mrs vogt 's conduct had been unlawful by holding such a senior political post within the dkp she necessarily espoused anti-constitutional aims and had therefore to be considered to be opposed to the constitution herself although she proclaimed her attachment to the basic law it was not possible to support both systems at the same time even though mrs vogt sought above all to achieve some of the dkp 's short-term objectives such as reducing unemployment promoting peace and eliminating so-called berufsverbote prohibitions on pursuing various occupations this did not mean that her conduct was not culpable the dkp 's aims were admittedly not all anti-constitutional some of them were compatible with the basic law however civil servants could not as a means of furthering their own political objectives make use of a party with anti-constitutional aims and help it to come to power in this connection the disciplinary court referred to the following observations made by the federal administrative court bundesverwaltungsgericht in a judgment of january adding that it adopted them as it was convinced that exactly the same reasoning applied to the case before it it is admittedly possible to accept the view of the federal disciplinary court bundesdisziplinargericht that the official in question does not seek to change the system of government of the federal republic of germany by the use of force and that this declaration can not be dismissed as mere 'lip-service it is also possible to accept his claim that he is mainly concerned with correcting what he perceives to be a discrepancy between the principles laid down in the constitution and their application in practice in the federal republic of germany and that he is profoundly sincere in his wish to establish a society that is more just particularly in the economic sphere however contrary to the view taken by the federal disciplinary court this does not mean that he is entitled to see in the dkp the political grouping through which he believes he can achieve his ideal political order it appears doubtful whether the view of the constitution espoused by the official and described above reflects accurately the principles enshrined in the basic law it is not necessary to resolve that question here in its judgment banning the former communist party kpd bverfge p. the federal constitutional court held that not only the 'tactics of conflict employed by the former kpd but also the different phases of the process leading to attainment of its final objective of 'socialist rule sozialistische herrschaft namely proletarian revolution by peaceful or violent means and the triumph of the working class were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system it also stated that intensive propaganda and persistent unrest aimed at establishing even if this was not to be achieved in the near future a political regime that was clearly contrary to the free democratic constitutional system inevitably caused direct and immediate harm to that system the federal constitutional court thus also unquestionably held that the transitional stages of this process which were of indefinite duration and which the party sought to impose through intensive propaganda and persistent unrest were incompatible with the free democratic constitutional system bverwge pp and hence contrary to the view taken by the federal disciplinary court the civil servant 's assertion that he did not intend to change the federal republic of germany 's political system by violent means which is moreover consistent with many statements made by his party is of no legal significance bverwge p the court also considered that the applicant 's commitment to changing the dkp 's policies could not exculpate her the political loyalty owed by civil servants entailed a duty for them to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups which criticised or cast aspersions on the state and the existing constitutional system the attitude of civil servants who even if they campaigned within the dkp for the renunciation of aims that were contrary to the constitution showed outside the party through the political offices they held that they unreservedly supported its programme and policy was incompatible with such a duty for as long as the dkp had not abandoned its anti-constitutional aims civil servants duty of political loyalty prevented them from actively working for it this remained valid even where it was their intention to bring the party closer to democratic values moreover during the disciplinary proceedings the applicant had declared her unconditional support for the dkp 's aims as set out in the mannheim programme like the administrative court the disciplinary court found that mrs vogt had knowingly breached her professional obligations although she was aware of the case-law and her superiors views on the subject she had continued and even stepped up her activities on behalf of the dkp her dismissal had therefore been justified since a civil servant who thus persisted in breaching her duties and refusing to see reason unbelehrbar was no longer capable of serving the state which must be able to rely on its servants loyalty to the constitution the court added that such a breach of duty was especially serious in the case of a teacher who was supposed to teach the children entrusted to her care the fundamental values of the constitution parents who because of compulsory education had to send their children to state schools were entitled to expect the state to employ only those teachers who unreservedly supported the free democratic constitutional system the state was under a duty to dismiss teachers who played an active role in an anti-constitutional organisation the court added that a radical change in a civil servant 's attitude could affect its assessment of the seriousness of professional misconduct however throughout the disciplinary proceedings far from cutting down on her activities on behalf of the dkp the applicant had in fact increased them it followed that a more lenient disciplinary measure aimed at persuading her to abandon her political activities within the dkp was bound to fail accordingly it was impossible to continue to employ her as a civil servant and her dismissal was inevitable her otherwise blameless conduct in carrying out her teaching tasks did not change the situation in any way since the basis of trust that was essential for her to continue as a civil servant was lacking on december the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint verfassungsbeschwerde with the federal constitutional court sitting as a panel of three judges the court decided on august not to entertain the constitutional complaint on the ground that it had insufficient prospects of success in the constitutional court 's view the competent courts analysis was based on the conviction that by her membership of the dkp and her active role within that party the applicant had breached her duties as a civil servant this conclusion was well-founded and in no way arbitrary after the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings mrs vogt had herself stated that there was no point section or part of the dkp 's programme of which she disapproved thus endorsing unconditionally the party 's aims set out in the mannheim programme the disciplinary tribunals had been entitled to find that the dkp 's aims were anti-constitutional notwithstanding the provisions of article para of the basic law regard being had to the applicant 's intractability in respect of her political loyalty the disciplinary courts had rightly considered that the basis of trust necessary for mrs vogt to continue to work as a civil servant was lacking despite the fact that she had declared herself to be in favour of a change in the party 's policy and had otherwise carried out her teaching tasks in a way that was irreproachable the applicant 's dismissal had therefore not amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality as regards her constitutional rights accordingly there had been no violation of article paras and of the basic law from to the applicant worked as a playwright and drama teacher at the north lower saxony regional theatre landesbühne in wilhelmshaven from february she was reinstated in her post as a teacher for the lower saxony education authority the land government had beforehand repealed the decree on the employment of extremists in the lower saxony civil service ministerpräsidentenbeschluß also known as the radikalenerlaß see paragraph below and had published regulations for dealing with earlier cases see paragraph below the following provisions of the basic law grundgesetz are relevant to the instant case article everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his or her opinions in speech writing and pictures and freely to obtain

shall be prevented from taking office as a member of parliament or from performing the duties attaching thereto no employment contract may be terminated and no one may be dismissed from employment on this ground by virtue of section of the federal civil service act bundesbeamtengesetz and section of the civil service general principles act beamtenrechtsrahmengesetz for the länder appointments to the civil service are subject to the requirement that the persons concerned satisfy the authorities that they will at all times uphold the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the basic law according to section of the federal civil service act and section third sentence of the civil service general principles act for the länder civil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the basic law and act to uphold it these provisions have been reproduced in the civil service legislation of the länder and in particular in section of the lower saxony civil service act niedersächsisches beamtengesetz which likewise provides that civil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the basic law and act to uphold it the lower saxony disciplinary code niedersächsische disziplinarordnung contains the following relevant provisions article para under this law measures may be taken against officials who have breached their professional duty while having the status of a civil servant article para the disciplinary measures shall be dismissal article para dismissal shall also entail loss of the right to a salary and of pension rights on january the federal chancellor and the prime ministers of the länder adopted the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service ministerpräsidentenbeschluß bulletin of the government of the federal republic of germany no of february p. which reiterated civil servants duty of loyalty to the free democratic constitutional system and provided as follows civil servants membership of parties or organisations that oppose the constitutional system and any support given to such parties or organisations shall as a general rule lead to a conflict of loyalty if this results in a breach of duty pflichtverstoß it shall be for the employer to decide in each case what measures are to be taken in order to implement the decree the government of the land of lower saxony adopted in particular on july provisions on political activity by applicants for civil-service posts and by civil servants directed against the free democratic constitutional system similar legislation was initially adopted in all the länder however from it was no longer or only partially applied in some länder the relevant legislation was even repealed in as part of their coalition agreement on the formation of a new government for the land of lower saxony the social democrat and green parties decided to repeal the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service the decree was repealed by a ministerial decision of june on august the land government took a number of measures relating to the treatment of earlier cases that is to say cases of persons who had been excluded from the civil service or refused admission to it on account of their political activities the decision made it possible and this happened in the present case see paragraph above for civil servants who had been dismissed following disciplinary proceedings to be reinstated in their posts provided that they satisfied the recruitment and qualification requirements without however entitling them to compensation or to arrears of salary in a leading case of may the federal constitutional court clarified the special duty of loyalty owed by german civil servants to the state and its constitution the tasks of a modern state administration are as varied as they are complex and they must be accomplished in an adequate effective and prompt manner if the political and social system is to function and groups minorities and individuals are to be able to lead a decent life that administration must be able to count on a body of civil servants which is united and loyal which faithfully performs its duties and is thoroughly dedicated to the state and the constitution if civil servants can not be relied upon society and state have no chance in situations of crisis it is sufficient to observe that the duty of political loyalty owed by civil servants is the core of civil servants duty of loyalty it does not mean a duty to identify with the aims or a particular policy of the government in power it means being prepared to identify with the idea of the state which the official has to serve and with the free democratic constitutional order of that state based on the rule of law and social justice it can not be in the interests of the state and society to have civil servants who are entirely uncritical it is however essential that a civil servant approves the state notwithstanding its defects and the existing constitutional order as it is in force and that he or she recognises that they merit protection bears witness to them accordingly and is active on their behalf the duty of political loyalty loyalty to the state and to the constitution requires more than an attitude which while formally correct is in fact uninterested indifferent and at heart distant in relation to the state and the constitution it entails inter alia the duty for civil servants to dissociate themselves unequivocally from groups and movements that criticise campaign against and cast aspersions on that state its institutions and the existing constitutional system the duty of loyalty owed by a civil servant applies to every type of appointment in the civil service an appointment of fixed duration an appointment on probation and an appointment subject to revocation as well as an appointment to a permanent post nor can there be any difference of treatment in this respect according to the nature of the civil servant 's duties the fact that the federal constitutional court has not exercised its power to declare a party anti-constitutional does not mean that it is impossible to have the conviction and to express that conviction that the party in question pursues anti-constitutional aims and must therefore be challenged in the political arena a party which for instance advocates in its manifesto the dictatorship of the proletariat or approves recourse to force in order to overthrow the constitutional system if the conditions are right pursues anti-constitutional aims in judgments of october and may the federal administrative court held that civil servants who played an active role in the dkp for example by holding a post in the party or by standing as its candidate in elections would be in breach of their duty of political loyalty because they would necessarily be identifying with the anti-constitutional aims of that party it followed the same line of reasoning in a judgment of january see paragraph above in its report of february the majority of the commission of inquiry of the international labour office concluded that the measures taken in application of the duty of faithfulness to the free democratic basic order have in various respects not remained within the limits of the restrictions authorised by article paragraph of the discrimination employment and occupation convention no it also formulated a number of recommendations in reply to this report the german government maintained that the measures taken to ensure that civil servants remained loyal to the constitution were not contrary to the relevant provisions of convention no and that in any case the recommendations made by the commission of inquiry were not binding on the german state for the purposes of domestic law mrs vogt 's application was lodged with the commission on february relying on articles and art art of the convention and on article taken together with article art she complained that her right to freedom of expression and to freedom of association had been infringed the commission declared the application no admissible on october in its report of november article art it expressed the opinion by thirteen votes to one that there had been a violation of articles and art art of the convention and that it was unnecessary to examine the application also under article art of the convention the full text of the commission 's opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment in their memorial the government requested the court to find that in this case the federal republic of germany did not violate articles and art art of the convention or article taken together with article art the applicant asked the court to find that there has been a violation of articles and art art of the

the case originated in an application no against the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by four newspapers and a news agency financial times ltd ft independent news media ltd guardian newspapers ltd times newspapers ltd and reuters group plc together the applicants on december the applicants were represented by clifford chance a law firm in the government the government were represented by their agent mr j. grainger of the foreign and commonwealth office the applicants alleged that the decision of the high court on december to order them to deliver up a leaked document to interbrew violated their right to freedom of expression and their right to respect for their home and correspondence they also alleged that there was an inequality of arms during the court proceedings which constituted a breach of their right to a fair hearing and of the procedural requirements implicit in the right to respect for their home and their correspondence and the right to freedom of expression on october the court decided to give notice of the application to the government it also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the facts of the case as submitted by the applicants may be summarised as follows on october the board of interbrew a belgian brewing company asked its investment bank advisers goldman sachs gs and lazard to carry out work on a potential association between interbrew and south african breweries plc sab a competitor in the brewing industry with a view to a possible takeover bid for sab by interbrew on november gs produced a document in relation to the possible takeover the document was confidential and contained data which were likely to affect both interbrew and sab 's share prices it formed the basis of a presentation which on november was submitted to interbrew 's internal mergers and acquisitions department on an unknown date a person x whose identity is unknown even by the applicants came into possession of a copy of the presentation submitted to interbrew on november x sent copies of a document the leaked document to various news media organisations including the ft the guardian the times and reuters from an address in on interbrew 's evidence the leaked document was very similar if not identical to the interbrew presentation except for the following a the substitution of an offer price for sab shares of between and pence in place of the price of between and pence which had apparently been in the original presentation and b the insertion of a timetable for making the offer on november mr jones a journalist at the ft received a copy of the leaked document from x at that day he telephoned mr van praag of gs and told him that he had received the leaked document and that he intended to publish it mr van praag reported the conversation to mr powell the chief executive officer of interbrew mr powell telephoned mr jones and told him on the record that interbrew had carried out research into sab but that it was not in the advanced stage of preparing an offer at about the ft published an article on its website stating that interbrew had been plotting a bid for sab that documents seen by the ft indicated that an approach could be made on december and referring to the conversation between mr jones and mr powell the article did not state the proposed offer price but gave accurate codenames used for the advisers in the presentation and quoted from the document on the likely positive market reaction and with reference to potential rival bids the ft published an article in the same terms in its newspaper the next morning at about on november the times received a copy of the leaked document from x in its second edition which reached the news stands at about on november it published an article referring to the confidential document which it had seen a supposed approach to sab this weekend a plot to bid gbp billion for sab and an offer expected to be pitched at up to pence per share at on november reuters reported the ft 's story and the rise in the share price of sab on the johannesburg stock exchange on its wire service reuters received a copy of the leaked document from x on the afternoon of november and at published a further article referring to its receipt of the leaked document at about on november gs and lazards contacted the takeover panel which asked interbrew to make a statement in response at about interbrew issued a press release confirming that it had undertaken a preliminary analysis of sab as part of its routine annual review of the leading brewers of the world that the analysis was at a very preliminary stage which might or might not lead to an offer at some time in the future but that no approach had been made on november the guardian received a copy of the leaked document from x on november it published an article referring to the secret document prepared by gs and lazards which it stated had been couriered to a large chunk of the business press and mentioning the leaking of previous bids by interbrew the independent did not receive a copy of the leaked document directly from x however it did take steps to obtain a copy from another source that it knew but undertook not to reveal it on november it published two articles about the leaked document one of which stated that the offer price and timetable appeared bogus on november interbrew in agreement with the takeover panel published a second statement to the press alleging that the leaked document contained fabrications this statement was reported by each of the applicants who continued to publish articles on the topics of doctored copies and a possible bid the impact of this press coverage on the market in shares of interbrew and sab appears to have been significant interbrew 's share price at market on november was eur by midday the next day it was eur it was eur after the press release and at market close the sab share price at market close on november was pence and at market close on november was pence the volume of sab 's shares traded on november was less than million on november it was more than million on november interbrew instructed kroll the security and risk consultants to assist in identifying x. kroll did not identify x on december interbrew made a criminal complaint to the examining magistrate of the brussels court of first instance together with a claim for civil damages against a person or persons unknown on december interbrew launched proceedings against the applicants in the high court following advice from kroll that access to the original documents might vitally assist the investigation given that the applicants were not aware of the identity of x interbrew lodged a claim for delivery up of documents containing or relating to an analysis of sab prepared by gs and/or lazards and evidencing or containing discussions with any journalistic source in respect of the subject matter of disclosure of such documents an order that the defendants do disclose the name and address of any journalistic source who had provided them with the documents referred to in any journalistic source with whom they have had the discussions referred to at at the same time interbrew without notice to the applicants applied for and was granted a temporary injunction from the high court in the following terms the defendants must not alter deface dispose of or otherwise deal with the documents referred to in schedule at paragraph thereof the defendants must not alter deface dispose of or otherwise deal with the documents referred to in schedule at paragraph thereof the defendants must within hours of service of this order deliver up the two categories of documents referred to at schedule to the custody of solicitors appointed on their behalf to be held until further order herein the defendants must within hours of service of this order serve on the claimant 's solicitors a list of the documents within their control those of the documents which were formerly in their control but are no longer in their control explaining what has happened to them and confirm the facts set out in this paragraph by means of a signed witness statement containing a statement of truth also within hours of service of this order provided that this order shall not require the defendants to provide any information which would disclose the source of information contained in a publication for which the defendants are responsible schedule the documents documents including draft documents and copy documents whether received by the defendants as copy documents or copies by the defendants provided to the defendants by any third party subsequent to november containing or relating to an analysis of sab prepared by gs and/or lazards documents evidencing or containing discussions with any journalistic source subsequent to november relating to an analysis of sab prepared by gs and/or lazards together with the envelopes or packaging in which they were delivered to the defendants and any additional documents contained therein. on december interbrew sought an order in different terms from the one granted on december instead of the original paragraph of the order interbrew sought an order requiring the applicants to serve within hours a witness statement setting out the names and addresses of every person who had provided them with the schedule documents and every person with whom they had had discussions evidenced or contained in the schedule documents and if these identities were not known the circumstances in which they received the documents to the best of their knowledge on december the judge ordered that paragraphs and of the order of december be discharged in their entirety an expedited hearing on interbrew 's application for an injunction took place on and december before the high court interbrew invoked the norwich pharmacal principle see paragraph below whereby if a person through no fault of his own becomes involved in the wrongdoing of others so as to facilitate that wrongdoing he comes under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoer on december the high court interbrew v. financial times et al ewhc ch ordered delivery up of the documents under the norwich pharmacal principle in the following terms the defendants must not alter deface dispose of or otherwise deal with the documents referred to in schedule the defendants must within hours of service of this order deliver up the documents and other materials referred to at schedule to the claimant 's solicitor the judge found at paragraph that what x has done is deliberately to admix with that confidential information false information a lethal concoction to create a false market in the shares of the claimant and sab a serious criminal offence there must be a real risk of repetition if x is not identified beyond the substantial private interest of the claimant there is a substantial public interest in identifying x and taking all necessary steps to prevent any repetition as it seems to me the circumstances of this case are exceptional vital public as well as individual interests are at stake in securing the integrity of the share market there is an overriding need for the disclosure sought in the interests of justice and for the prevention of crime the judge continued at paragraph as it seems to me the claimant has sufficiently explored other avenues before having recourse to this application for relief against the press there have been internal investigations conducted at the advisers and the claimant 's businesses the claimant is conducting inquiries further afield the claimant is using investigators of the highest international calibre the defendants complain that full details of all the claimant 's inquiries are not given in the claimant 's evidence and that this is necessary in order to establish how thorough they have been but there is no substance in this complaint the evidence establishes to my satisfaction that full and proper investigations have been made and are continuing to require disclosure of more details of these investigations is unnecessary even as such a course may prejudice the ongoing inquiries the evidence before me and most particularly a report by kroll establishes that the claimant needs the information which production of the documents ought to provide to further and give impetus to these investigations i am satisfied that the order is required if progress is to be made whilst the trail is still warm and if an identification is to be made within the time frame necessary to safeguard the interests of the claimant and the public. the applicants were granted leave to appeal by the court of appeal on december and were required to file their written arguments with the court by december by judgment of march the court of appeal dismissed the applicants appeal interbrew v. financial times et al ewca civ in the leading judgment of sedley lj the court of appeal held that in order to justify the exercise of norwich pharmacal powers to compel production of documents or disclosure of information interbrew had to establish that each defendant had facilitated a civil wrong committed by an unknown person against whom they aimed to seek redress the only civil wrong on which interbrew could rely was that of a breach of confidence on the part of the source while such a breach of confidence had been made out what had not been made out was a bigger and better cause of action in respect of the 'lethal cocktail of fact and falsehood since the element of falsehood can neither form part of the protected confidence nor stand on its own as a discrete tort at paragraph sedley lj went on to consider the approach adopted by the high court as follows at paragraphs everything proceeded below on the assumption that crimes of forgery and market manipulation were proved but both or at least the former depend upon the falsity of the pages in the document showing bid price and timetable false they were if one goes on such evidence as was before the court but by definition their falsity is alleged against an absent and silent accused we have no way of knowing any more than as counsel for the applicants stressed the five defendants do whether the source if cornered would demonstrate that he had simply assembled authentic documents from different places within interbrew gs and lazards i have to say that i find this aspect of the norwich pharmacal procedure troubling a commercial enterprise which may very well have its own reasons for denying the authenticity of a document gets a clear run against a media defendant which can only save in rare cases take a neutral stand on the question the court of first instance needs to be extremely circumspect before accepting evidence especially when as here it is second- or third-hand that goes to the heart of the case and can not be controverted however sedley lj concluded i have come to the conclusion though not without misgiving that the order for disclosure was rightly made against all the defendants nothing which has been put before us suggests that the court will be significantly better placed at an eventual trial than it is now to decide the key issues and there is at least some force in interbrew 's complaint that its hands are tied vis-à-vis south african breweries and possibly other targets too unless and until it can prevent a recurrence of this spoiling operation interbrew 's prima facie entitlement to delivery up of the documents is established because and solely because it may enable them to ascertain the identity of the proper defendant to a breach of confidence action relating to the relatively anodyne though not the explosive parts of the document from the sweep of interbrew 's original case and the lethal cocktail on which lightman j founded his conclusions the basis of the application now shrinks to this little measure but though little it is far from insignificant for interbrew with it one turns to of the act the section begins by barring any order for disclosure in circumstances such as these since its very object is to discover the source of information which the defendants have published interbrew however can invoke one of the listed purposes for lifting the bar that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice that it may also go to the prevention of crime can not be ruled out as irrelevant but it is peripheral because it is not a purpose for which interbrew themselves are entitled to disclosure then is the public interest in the doing of justice sufficient in the particular circumstances of this case to make disclosure necessary reading that question through the lens of the convention and its jurisprudence as we are now required to do the following elements separate themselves out first what is the nature and weight of the public interest in the confidentiality of sources the right of free expression enshrined in art is undifferentiated but as the european court of human rights said in goodwin 'freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and p rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom paras much judicial authority in this country says the same the news media in consequence enjoy in of the act a high initial level of protection not in their own but in the public interest the entitlement to reverse the balance is prescribed by law as art requires a required ground for doing so founded on the no less important public interest in an effective system of justice is present is it then necessary to reverse the balance the following elements seem to me to matter here • any invasion of the protection must meet a pressing social need not merely an individual one this meets the need to counterpose one public interest to another here the need in terms of is to enable interbrew to restrain by court action any further breach of confidence by the source and possibly to recover damages for losses already sustained in terms of art it is to protect the rights of interbrew • there must be no less invasive alternative while i would not adopt the judge 's approach of simply refusing to second-guess the view of the aggrieved parties solicitors i would infer from the evidence that as much has been done as can at present be done by the use of reputable private detectives to trace the source i can see that to demand particulars of the admittedly general assertions about this could jeopardise the exercise it seems to me that once the legitimacy of interbrew 's intended resort to law is accepted the relatively modest leak of which they are entitled to complain does not diminish the prospective seriousness for them of its repetition for the media on the other hand the public interest in their freedom to publish is constant and with it the public interest in the confidentiality of their sources while i do not think that the character of the material is irrelevant as a matter of law i agree with laws lj in ashworth at least to this extent that it can not be for the court to decide how interesting or important it thinks the material is that is for journalists and their editors but it may follow that the more the press decide to make of a story the greater will be the affected party 's legitimate interest in finding and suppressing its source what in my judgment matters critically at least in the present situation is the source 's evident purpose it was on any view a maleficent one calculated to do harm whether for profit or for spite and whether to the investing public or interbrew or both it is legitimate in reaching this view to have regard not only to what interbrew assert is the genuine document but also to the interpolated pages for whether they are forged or authentic integral or added they were calculated to maximise the mischief to this factual extent the 'lethal cocktail is material despite its legal irrelevance to the earlier stages of the inquiry the public interest in protecting the source of such a leak is in my judgment not sufficient to withstand the countervailing public interest in letting interbrew seek justice in the courts against the source. on july the house of lords refused the applicants leave to appeal following which interbrew required the applicants to comply with the court order for delivery up of the documents the applicants have refused to comply while interbrew has instituted enforcement proceedings against the guardian it has not pursued these proceedings the exercise of the power to require the delivery up of otherwise confidential information derives from the jurisdiction established by the decision of the house of lords in norwich pharmacal v. customs excise commissioners ac at page the authorities seem to me to point to a very reasonable principle that if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrong-doing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers i do not think that it matters whether he became so mixed up by voluntary action on his part or because it was his duty to do what he did it may be that if this causes him expense the person seeking the information ought to reimburse him but justice requires that he should co-operate in righting the wrong if he unwittingly facilitated its perpetration. that power is subject to section of the contempt of court act the act which provides that no court may require a person to disclose nor is any person guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose the source of information contained in a publication for which he is responsible unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime. prior to the proceedings in the present case the court of appeal had held in ashworth hospital authority v. mgn ltd all er that the phrase the interests of justice in section of the act was wide enough to include the exercise of legal rights and the ability to seek protection from legal wrongs whether or not by court action this interpretation was later confirmed by the house of lords in ashworth hospital authority v. mgn ltd wlr in ashworth the high court granted an order compelling the mirror newspaper to reveal a source to the mirror subsequently disclosed its source as robin ackroyd an investigative journalist ashworth brought new proceedings to seek an order for disclosure against mr ackroyd and applied for summary judgment on the grounds that the case was indistinguishable from that of the mirror in the previous ashworth case mr ackroyd submitted that the facts were materially different the high court granted the order requested but it was overturned on appeal to the court of appeal which held in mersey care nhs trust v. robin ackroyd ewca civ at paragraph that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom in a democratic society an order for source disclosure can not be compatible with article of the european convention unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest although there is a clear public interest in preserving the confidentiality of medical records that alone can not in my view be automatically regarded as an overriding requirement without examining the facts of a particular case it would be an exceptional case indeed if a journalist were ordered to disclose the identity of his source without the facts of his case being fully examined i do not say that literally every journalist against whom an order for source disclosure is sought should be entitled to a trial but the nature of the subject matter argues in favour of a trial in most cases the civil procedure rules cpr govern procedure in civil proceedings in england and relevant excerpts of the cpr provide as follows rule the court may at any time order a party to a clarify any matter which is in dispute in the proceedings or b give additional information in relation to any such matter whether or not the matter is contained or referred to in a statement of case paragraph is subject to any rule of law to the contrary rule the general rule is that any fact which needs to be proved by the evidence of witnesses is to be proved a at trial by their oral evidence given in public and b at any other hearing by their evidence in writing this is subject a to any provision to the contrary contained in these rules or elsewhere or b to any order of the court rule subject to paragraph the general rule is that evidence at hearings other than the trial is to be by witness statement unless the court a practice direction or any other enactment requires otherwise at hearings other than the trial a party may rely on the matters set out in a his statement of case or b his application notice if the statement of case or application notice is verified by a statement of truth rule where at a hearing other than the trial evidence is given in writing any party may apply to the court for permission to cross-examine the person giving the evidence the press complaints commission has adopted a code of conduct which is regularly reviewed and amended as required the code of conduct reads insofar as relevant as follows accuracy newspapers and periodicals must take care not to publish inaccurate misleading or distorted material including pictures whenever it is recognised that a significant inaccuracy misleading statement or distorted report has been published it must be corrected promptly and with due prominence an apology must be published whenever appropriate newspapers whilst free to be partisan must distinguish clearly between comment conjecture and fact a newspaper or periodical must report fairly and accurately the outcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party confidential sources journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information. there have been no significant changes to the above provisions since on march the committee of ministers of the council of europe adopted a recommendation no r on the right of journalists not to disclose their sources of information the recommendation provides at principle as follows a the right of journalists not to disclose information identifying a source must not be subject to other restrictions than those mentioned in article paragraph of the convention in determining whether a legitimate interest in a disclosure falling within the scope of article paragraph of the convention outweighs the public interest in not disclosing information identifying a source competent authorities of member states shall pay particular regard to the importance of the right of non-disclosure and the pre-eminence given to it in the case-law of the european court of human rights and may only order a disclosure if subject to paragraph b there exists an overriding requirement in the public interest and if circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature the disclosure of information identifying a source should not be deemed necessary unless it can be convincingly established that reasonable alternative measures to the disclosure do not exist or have been exhausted by the persons or public authorities that seek the disclosure and the legitimate interest in the disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in the non-disclosure bearing in mind that an overriding requirement of the need for disclosure is proved the circumstances are of a sufficiently vital and serious nature the necessity of the disclosure is identified as responding to a pressing social need and member states enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing this need but this margin goes hand in hand with the supervision by the european court of human rights the above requirements should be applied at all stages of any proceedings where the right of non-disclosure might be invoked,case originated application united kingdom great britain northern ireland lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms convention four newspapers news agency

on june the paper in question printed an article entitled d. ‘ introduced himself in the restaurant on monday the article included the following text ‘ d. is sitting in the restaurant rollicking drunk one of our readers reported to the editorial office of the newspaper on monday evening as we checked with our own eyes it really was true the president of the political party was really sitting in the restaurant named and his appearance revealed that our reader had not done him an injustice d. was accompanied by an individual who claimed to be a high-ranking police official ‘ gentlemen brothers páni bratia d. boomed as he staggered from the terrace to the bar then as if he wanted to take flight with his arms outstretched he gave an order for departure and headed for the stairs his friend even offered to help him out but d. refused ‘ come with me he called out to the forty or so diners present where he did not say but none of the diners stood up as alleged by several eyewitnesses only shortly before our arrival d. had urinated off the terrace of the restaurant onto the pavement according to our findings the president of the members of the party arrived at the restaurant already in an inebriated state ‘ when he arrived he already looked a state he only had a few cognacs here we were told by one of those present who does not wish to be named contented d. was finally driven off in his car by his driver who had been hanging about outside nervously the entire time waiting for the president to have his fill of fun on june the paper printed an article entitled have the leader and high-ranking police officer planned a coup an eyewitness to d. s running wild has spoken out the article included the following text the paper was the first to report that last week the president of the political party d. while intoxicated urinated off the terrace of a restaurant onto the pavement for publishing this information d. wants to sue our paper and claim slovakian korunas we bring you now the account of an eyewitness to d. s running wild on monday ‘ i was sitting with my friends at the bar d. arrived with a man who claimed to be a high-ranking police officer d. came up to the bar obviously under the influence ordered two beers and the two went to sit on the terrace on the terrace they were served by a waitress they were drinking cognac after a while one man who had been sitting with them left and said that the policemen had wet himself on the chair the policeman himself then walked from the terrace to the interior of the restaurant and we really saw that he was completely wasted he came back a moment later and fell asleep in his chair the witness added ‘ the policeman also told d. ‘ i will ensure that there are civic disturbances within two weeks don t worry about anything but you have to provide me with support d. rejoined ‘ don t worry you are under my protection. we laughed at that because d. must have misunderstood the meaning of support since he started urinating off the terrace he and the policeman were holding each other up the concrete railing is relatively high so he had difficulty he was standing on tip toes he was doing what he could the witness recalls as d. answered the call of nature the witness also recalls that the policeman s head had dropped and had had to be supported by a plastic chair the paper has found out that d. was in fact in the company of a high-ranking police officer his identity is known to our paper. on june the paper printed an article entitled the minister of the interior has entrusted the investigation of the scandal to the police inspection service d. went on the rampage with the police vicepresident the article included the following text the paper has established the identity of the high-ranking police officer who accompanied the leader of the political party d. to the restaurant last week d. went on the rampage in this establishment with the vice-president of the police corps colonel e. shortly after the incident the president of the political party declined to disclose the identity of the man identifying him in the media as a friend the minister of the interior has already charged the police inspection service with investigating the scandal ‘ i can not believe things went that far if they did then i will act according to the findings of the investigation everyone is the master of their own fate the minister stated for the paper he did so in reply to our question as to whether the vicepresident would be removed from office should the information that we had been published in our daily be confirmed let us be reminded that according to an eyewitness to the incident the president of the political party and the vicepresident of the police corps were drinking cognac on a terrace ‘ after a while one man who had been sitting with them left and said that the policeman had wet himself on a chair the policeman himself then walked from the terrace to the interior of the restaurant and we really saw that he was completely wasted the witness recalled according to him the vice-president e. also held d. up when the latter standing on tip toes urinated off the terrace onto the pavement the witness likewise heard e. suggest to d. that within two weeks he would ensure that there were civic disturbances he asked the president of the political party for ‘ support e. confirmed to the paper yesterday that he had been drinking in the restaurant with d. however he refutes the claim that he had wet himself he also claims that he has never planned any civic disturbances with d. the president of the police stated for the paper that ‘ if it were proven that what you have written is true i as president of the police corps would be very sorry that s all i have to say. the articles mentioned above were also published in the on-line version of the newspaper on and june some of the information from the articles mentioned above was used in an article published on june in a newspaper in the entitled d. did not urinate onto the people alone he was assisted by the vicepresident of the police force on march e. sued a. in civil courts for libel demanding publication of a correction and an apology and claiming the equivalent of some euros eur in compensation for damage to his reputation e. admitted having been at the restaurant and having consumed alcoholic beverages in a moderate quantity with d. at the given time but contested the truthfulness of all the other facts alleged in the articles he argued that his personal integrity had been interfered with and that he had been falsely discredited in particular in the sphere of his service ranking his civic dignity and his family life on october september october december and june the žilina district court okresný súd held hearings at the latter hearing the district court invited the parties to adduce further evidence and instructed them that once the evidence-taking was closed they would have only a limited possibly to adduce further evidence in the event of an appeal the parties declared that they had no further evidence to adduce following which the evidencetaking was closed and a judgment was given in the judgment of june the district court found for the claimant it ordered a. to publish in the abovementioned newspaper an article correcting the inaccurate information accepting that such information was false and apologising to e. was also ordered to pay the amount claimed see paragraph above together with the claimant s legal costs the district court had examined testimonies by d. his driver g. the claimant s wife b. c. f. another diner at the restaurant h. and two other witnesses the district court had also examined the contents of the court file concerning the libel action by d. on the basis of the same facts and the case file concerning disciplinary proceedings against e. reports by the national institute of meteorology and a sworn expert on toxicology had also been taken into account the district court considered untrustworthy the submissions of b. and c. the authors of the articles one of whom had witnessed a part of the reported incident and f. on whose statements b. and c. had mostly relied the district court considered that d. e. and the remaining witnesses either did not confirm or actually contested the reported facts as to the behaviour of d. and e. in conclusion a. had failed to establish the truthfulness of the facts and the articles could not be considered a justified critique the district court observed that there were opposing interests at stake in particular the freedom of expression under article of the convention and the right to respect for private life under article of the convention weighing the right of e. to have his personal integrity protected against the right of a. to freedom of expression the district court found that the articles had significantly and without acceptable justification damaged e. s position in his employment family and society in general a. appealed arguing that the district court had erred in the assessment of the facts and in the application of the law in particular the district court had failed to explain why it considered untrustworthy the evidence of b. c. and f. it also contended that the district court had arbitrarily considered h. who had had no clear recollection of the relevant events to be the key witness for the defence while the key witness had in fact been f. who confirmed that e. had been intoxicated that he had spoken of receiving protection from d. that e. s head had dropped and had to be supported by a plastic chair and that e. had had a damp patch on his trousers giving the impression that he had urinated in them requested that the discrepancy in the testimonies be explained by means of a face-to-face witness meeting the žilina krajský súd called a hearing of the appeal for february a. was summoned through the intermediary of its lawyer but excused itself and agreed to the hearing s taking place in its absence on february the held a hearing at which it questioned the claimant see paragraph below neither a. nor its lawyer was present following the hearing on the same day the upheld the first-instance judgment but reduced the amount of damages to the equivalent of some eur the court of appeal found that neither b. nor c. nor f. had seen or directly testified that e. had urinated in his trousers that he had incited civic disturbances and that he had held d. up while the latter had urinated from the terrace of the restaurant the court of appeal relied on the principle of truthfulness of information consisting of the following elements information intended for publication was to be verified by at least two but ideally more credible and mutually independent sources with care adequate to the circumstances the law could only protect the journalists if they could establish the truthfulness of the impugned material as well as their bona fides in publishing it and the presence of a public interest in the matter under the applicable procedural rules it was not permissible at the appellate stage to take new evidence at the request of the parties which had not been adduced at the first-instance level the court of appeal found that it therefore could not call a face-to-face witness meeting as requested by a it followed that in the given evidentiary situation the conclusions of the first-instance court as to the essence of the claim were justified however the court of appeal considered the existing evidence insufficient to justify the award of damages made by the first-instance court it was therefore necessary to take new evidence of the court s own motion by hearing the claimant and eventually to reduce the amount of the award it held it established that the greatest loss that the claimant had suffered had been in the area of his employment on october the applicant company lodged a complaint under article of the constitution with the ústavný súd directed against the decision of the court of appeal the applicant company pointed out that the court of appeal had considered as decisive whether or not the defendant could establish the truthfulness of the reported facts this was however not compatible with the principle of freedom of expression which also extended to untrue information the applicant company submitted that b. had verified the facts by witnessing the incident in person and that b. and c. had verified the facts by interviewing witness f. and the claimant they had thereby acted bona fides and in accordance with journalistic ethics what also was of relevance was that the claimant had been a public figure the ordinary courts however had completely omitted to carry out an assessment of these essential components of the concept of freedom of expression the applicant company considered the amount of the damages awarded to be excessive referring to the judgment of the court in the case of marônek v. slovakia no echr where the equivalent of some european currency units worth of damages in a libel case had been considered excessive the applicant company contended that it had been incompatible with the guarantees of a fair trial and in particular the equality of arms principle for the court of appeal to base its ruling on damages solely on the additional evidence provided by the claimant as this evidence had not been adduced by the parties it had served only one of the parties and as it had been taken at the appellate level the defendant had had no opportunity to contest it moreover this evidence was not impartial by definition and the court of appeal had failed to corroborate it by other evidence which was contrary to the established judicial practice as regards the finding that the claimant s greatest loss had been in the sphere of his employment the court of appeal had failed to take into account that the disciplinary proceedings against the claimant had in fact ended in his favour according to the applicant company the ordinary courts had erred in the assessment of the witness evidence in particular that provided by f. by arbitrarily selecting elements benefiting the claimant in so far as the testimony of f. was concerned in addition the ordinary courts had failed to support their findings with adequate reasoning on march the declared the complaint inadmissible observing that it was not a court of a third or fourth instance the found no indication of any unlawfulness or constitutionally relevant arbitrariness in the proceedings and decisions of the court of appeal as to the complainant s specific argument that the court of appeal had taken new evidence see paragraph above without informing the complainant and giving it an opportunity to comment the constitutional court found that the complainant had failed to exhaust ordinary remedies by raising this argument by way of an appeal on points of law under article f of the code of civil procedure law no coll. as amended the ccp the decision of the was served on the applicant company on april the status of international human rights treaties in is defined in article the relevant part of which reads as follows international treaties on human rights and fundamental freedoms .... which have been ratified and promulgated in the manner required by statute take precedence over statue. article provides that in the discharge of their function judges are independent and in decision-making they are only bound by the constitution constitutional law international treaties under article of the constitution and statute. the protection of personal integrity is governed by the provisions of articles et seq in so far as relevant these provide article every natural person shall have the right to protection of his or her personal integrity in particular his or her civil honour and human dignity as well as privacy name article every natural person shall have the right inter alia to request an order restraining any unjustified interference with his or her personal integrity an order cancelling out the effects of such interference and an award of appropriate compensation if the satisfaction afforded under paragraph of this article is insufficient in particular because the injured party s dignity or social standing has been considerably diminished the injured party shall also be entitled to financial compensation for nonpecuniary damage when determining the amount of compensation payable under paragraph of this article the court shall take into account the seriousness of the harm suffered by the injured party and the circumstances in which the violation of his or her rights occurred. the code regulates the conduct of the court and parties in civil proceedings so as to ensure the just protection of the rights and legally recognised interests of the parties as well as promoting the observance of laws honest fulfilment of duties and respect for the rights of other persons article article it provides that parties to civil proceedings have equal standing the court is duty-bound to ensure they have equal opportunity to assert their rights parties to the proceedings have the right to comment on any evidence adduced and taken article under article d civil proceedings can be reopened where the court has found a violation of the requesting party s convention rights and where serious consequences of the violation have not been adequately redressed by the award of just satisfaction a court of appeal can in principle reassess evidence or take further evidence provided that it can be done without delay article as in force at the relevant time under article an appeal on points of law dovolanie lies against final and binding decisions of appellate courts if certain statutory admissibility criteria are met the general admissibility criteria that is those applicable to both judgments rozsudok and resolutions uznesenie are set out in article these comprise situations where a the courts decided in a matter outside their jurisdiction b a person who acted as a party to the proceedings lacked the legal capacity to be a party to court proceedings c a party to the proceedings lacked the capacity to act in court proceedings and was not duly represented d the courts decided on a matter which had been res iudicata or which had already been pending in other proceedings lis pendens e the proceedings could only commence by way of an action and no such action was actually filed f the courts prevented a party to the proceedings from acting before them and g where the case was decided upon by an excluded judge or where the composition of the court was incorrect in addition to the above-mentioned general admissibility criteria special admissibility criteria apply if the court of appeal decided in the form of a judgment these are defined in article under paragraph of article an appeal on points of law is admissible where the appellate court overturned the judgment of a firstinstance court in accordance with paragraph of article an appeal on points of law also lies against a judgment of the appellate court in which the latter did not follow the binding legal view previously expressed in the same matter by the court of cassation under article a an appeal on points of law is also admissible against a judgment of an appellate court in which it upholds a judgment of a first-instance court and at the same time rules that such an appeal is admissible as the case concerns a matter of particular legal importance finally under article b an appeal on points of law is also admissible against a second judgment of an appellate court in which it upholds a second judgment of a first-instance court if in the second round the first-instance court decided differently than in its first judgment which had been quashed by the first decision of the court of appeal because it was bound by the legal view expressed by the court of appeal in its first judgment this rule also applies to the third and as the case may be subsequent judgments of the court of appeal as to the merits an appeal on points of law can only be based on the grounds defined in article that is to say that the proceedings have been vitiated by an error envisaged in article letter a that the proceedings have been vitiated by another error that resulted in an incorrect decision on the merits letter b and that the decision rests on an error of law letter c in a decision of july in an unrelated case no iv ús the constitutional court observed that in relation to evidence-taking the right to a fair hearing under article of the convention was to be understood so that a party to the proceedings must be provided with the opportunity to take part in the evidence-taking in a manner defined by statute which means to adduce evidence to be present when the evidence is being taken including the right to interview witnesses and parties and to take a position in respect of evidence adduced and taken for that reason a party to the proceedings must always have the opportunity to be present at the evidence-taking should that not have been the case the error can be qualified as judicial conduct that has prevented the party from acting before a court thereby constituting a ground for

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a swedish national mr christopher gillberg the applicant on october the applicant was represented by mr bertil bjernstam a bachelor of laws from gothenburg the swedish government the government were represented by their agent mrs inger kalmerborn from the ministry for foreign affairs the applicant alleged in particular that in civil proceedings concerning access to various research material and in subsequent criminal proceedings against him his rights under articles and of the convention had been breached on june the court decided to give notice of the application to the government it also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility article the applicant and the government each filed written observations rule the applicant was born in and lives in gothenburg he is a professor specialising in child and adolescent psychiatry at the in the period between and a research project was carried out at the in the field of neuropsychiatry focusing on the incidences of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd or deficits in attention motor control and perception damp in children the aim was to elucidate the significance thereof and associated problems from a long-term perspective parents to a group of one hundred and fortyone preschool children volunteered to participate in the study which was followed up every third year certain assurances were made to the children s parents and later to the young people themselves concerning confidentiality the research papers called the gothenburg study were voluminous and consisted of a large number of records test results interview replies questionnaires and video and audio tapes it contained a very large amount of privacy-sensitive data about the children and their relatives several doctoral theses have been based on the gothenburg study the material was stored by the department of child and adolescent psychiatry of which the applicant was director the project was originally set up and started by other researchers but the applicant had subsequently taken over the responsibility for completing the study the applicant alleged that the ethics committee of the in their permits had made it a precondition that sensitive information about the individuals participating in the study would be accessible only to the applicant and his staff and that therefore the applicant promised absolute confidentiality to the patients and their parents the government maintained in their observations that they had been unable to find the permits referred to by the applicant thus they could not confirm that the permits contained requirements of absolute secrecy instead the government had located four research applications to the ethics committee of the dated january january october and march according to which the applicant bore the main responsibility for the study in and together with his wife also in but not for the study in concerning the issue of secrecy the research applications can be summarised as follows in the first application it was stated that it would not be possible to identify individual children and that the research team did not intend to register any case records in the first of the two applications submitted in it was stated that the project leader being a medical doctor was bound by professional secrecy and was to be responsible for the registers set up within the research project that the registers were to be made non-personalised after the study had been carried out and that the results were to be presented in a way that would make it impossible to identify different individuals furthermore if data registers were to be used the data inspection board s datainspektionen instructions were to be followed in an additional application from the same year concerning inter alia the use of social registers it was stated that it would not be possible to identify different individuals through the data processing that was to be carried out and that only the project leader was to have access to the identification code the application from contains the same language as the application submitted in january before the court enclosed in his observations the applicant submitted two permits by the ethics committee of the of respectively march and may both permits bore signatures of approval on behalf of the ethics committee of the on the applications of january and march mentioned above the submitted permits contained no reference to absolute secrecy the assurance of confidentiality given to the participants in the study in had the following wording all data will be dealt with in confidence and classified as secret no data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place no information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she/he took part in a study undertaken by and its present results will as was the case for the previous study three years ago be followed up. a later assurance of confidentiality had the following wording participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you. in february a sociologist k requested access to the background material she was a researcher at and maintained that it was of great importance to have access to the research material and that it could without risk of damage be released to her with conditions under chapter section of the secrecy act she had no interest in the personal data as such but only in the method used in the research and the evidence the researchers had for their conclusions her request was refused on february by the because k had not shown any connection between the requested material and any research and on the ground that the material contained data on individuals health status which if disclosed could be assumed to harm an individual or persons related to that individual the decision was appealed against to the administrative court of appeal kammarrätten i göteborg which directed the matter to the to examine whether the material could be released after removal of identifying information or with a condition restricting k s right to pass on or use data the refused the request again on september on the ground that the data requested was subject to secrecy that there was no possibility of releasing the material after removal of identifying information nor was there sufficient evidence to conclude that the requested material could be released with conditions k appealed again against the decision to the administrative court of appeal in the meantime in july a paediatrician e also requested access to the material he submitted that he needed to keep up with current research that he was interested in how the research in question had been carried out and in clarifying how the researchers had arrived at their results and that it was important to the neuropsychiatric debate that the material could be exposed to independent and critical examination his request was refused by the on august for the same reasons as its refusal to k a decision against which e appealed to the administrative court of appeal by two separate judgments of february the administrative court of appeal found that k and e had shown a legitimate interest in gaining access to the material in question and that they could be assumed to be well acquainted with the handling of confidential data therefore access should be granted to k and e but subject to conditions made by the in order to protect the interests of the individuals concerned in accordance with various named provisions of the secrecy act sekretesslagen the s application for a review by the supreme administrative act was refused in vain the applicant and some of the individuals participating in the study requested relief for substantive defects resning to the regeringsrätten which was refused on april because they were not considered to be party to the case bristende talerätt on april the decided that provided that the individuals concerned gave their consent the documents would be released to k and e with conditions specified in detail in the decisions k and e appealed against certain of the conditions imposed by the they also reported the university of gothenburg s handling of the case to the parliamentary ombudsman which in decisions of and june criticised the notably as to the length of the proceedings for replying to the request for access in two separate judgments of august the administrative court of appeal lifted some of the conditions imposed by the university it pointed out that in the judgments of february k and e had already been given the right of access to the requested documents and that the only matter under examination was the conditions set up and that such could only be imposed if they were designed to remove a given risk of damage and that a condition should be framed to restrict the recipient s right of disposal over the data thereafter six conditions were set regarding k s access including that the data was only to be used within the swedish research council funded research project called the neurological paradigm on the establishment of a new grand theory in sweden which k had specified before the administrative court of appeal that she was not allowed to remove copies from the premises where she was given access to the documents and that transcripts of released documents containing data on psychological medical or neurological examinations or treatment or concerning the personal circumstances of individuals and notes concerning such examinations treatment or circumstances from a document released to her would be destroyed when the above research project was completed and at the latest by december six similar conditions were also imposed on e including that data in the released documents referring to psychological medical psychiatric or neurological examinations or treatment and data in the released documents concerning the personal circumstances of an individual was to be used for examination of how the researchers who participated in the research project in which the documents had been used had arrived at their results and conclusions and so that he could generally maintain his competence as a paediatrician the did not have a right to appeal against the judgments and on november the applicant s request to the for relief for substantive defects was refused because he was not considered to be a party to the case in the meantime in a letter of august to the applicant the vicechancellor of the university stated that by virtue of the judgments by the and k were entitled to immediate access to the documents on the conditions specified furthermore by decision of the university e and k were to be given access to the documents on the university s premises on a named street and the documents therefore had to be moved there from the department of child and adolescent psychiatry without delay the letter stated that the transportation of the documents was to begin on august at a.m the applicant was requested to arrange for the documents to be available for collection at that time and that if necessary he should also ensure that all the keys to the rooms where the material was kept were delivered to a person p. the applicant replied in a letter of august that he did not intend to hand over either the material or the keys to the filing cabinets to p. on the same day the vice-chancellor had a meeting with the applicant on instruction by the vice-chancellor on august p visited the department of child and adolescent psychiatry he was met by controller l who handed him a document showing that l had been instructed by the applicant not to release either the material in question or the keys to the filing cabinets by letter of september the vice-chancellor of the informed k and e that since the applicant refused to transfer the material for the present he could not help them any further and that he was considering bringing the applicant before the public disciplinary board statens ansvarsnämnd on grounds of disobedience in autumn the applicant and various persons corresponded with the vice-chancellor of the including a professor of jurisprudence and assistant director general of the swedish research council who questioned the judgments by the administrative court of appeal which prompted the vice-chancellor to consider whether it would be possible to impose new conditions the case was discussed within the university board and subsequently by decision of january the university of gothenburg decided to refuse to grant access to k because in the light of a memorandum drawn up on march by the swedish research council there was no connection between k s research and the research project that she had specified before the administrative court of appeal likewise in a decision of february the university decided to impose a new condition on e in order to give him access it stated that it had reason to believe that e did not conduct activities or hold a position that justified allowing him access to the material even subject to restrictions e thus had to demonstrate that his duties for the municipality included reviewing or otherwise acquiring information about the basic material on which the research in question was based the decisions were annulled by the administrative court of appeal by two separate judgments of may the applicant s request to the administrative supreme court for relief for substantive defects was refused on respectively september and july because he was not considered to be party to the case in the meantime according to the applicant the research material was destroyed during the weekend of and may by three of his colleagues on january the parliamentary ombudsman decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant and by a judgment of june the district court göteborgs tingsrätt convicted the applicant of misuse of office pursuant to chapter article of the penal code brottsbalken the applicant was given a suspended sentence and ordered to pay fifty day-fines of swedish kronor sek amounting to a total of sek approximately euros eur the vice-chancellor of the university was also convicted of misuse of office for having disregarded through negligence his obligations as vice-chancellor by failing to ensure that the documents were available for release as ordered in accordance with the judgments of the administrative court of appeal the vice-chancellor was sentenced to forty dayfines of sek amounting to a total of sek approximately eur the parliamentary ombudsman had also decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the chair of the board of gothenburg university but the charges were later dismissed finally by a judgment issued on march the three officials who had destroyed the research material were convicted of the offence of suppression of documents and were sentenced to a conditional sentence and fines on appeal on february the applicant s conviction and sentence were upheld by the court of appeal hovrätten för västra sverige which stated as follows general observations on the university s management of the case in its two initial judgments of february the administrative court of appeal laid down that k and e were entitled to have access to the documents requested in its two subsequent judgments of august the administrative court of appeal decided on the conditions that would apply in connection with the release of the documents to them the judgments by the administrative court of appeal had therefore settled the question of whether the documents were to be released to k and e once and for all at the hearing in the administrative court of appeal the university had the opportunity to present reasons why the documents requested should not be released to k and e. once the judgments against which no appeal could be made had been issued in february whether or not the university considered that they were based on erroneous or insufficient grounds had no significance after the february judgments the university was only required to formulate the conditions it considered necessary to avoid the risk of any individuals sustaining harm through the release of the documents subsequently the university had the opportunity to present its arguments to the administrative court of appeal for the formulation of the conditions it had chosen after the administrative court of appeal had determined which conditions could be accepted the question of the terms on which k and e could be allowed access to the documents requested was also settled once and for all there was then no scope for the university to undertake any new appraisal of k s and e s right of access to the documents therefore in the period referred to in the indictment from august until may it was no longer the secrecy legislation that was to be interpreted but the judgments of the administrative court of appeal their contents were clear the vice-chancellor s letter of august to the applicant and to k and e of september show that the university administration had understood that it was incumbent on the university to release the documents without delay the promptness required by the freedom of the press act in responding to a request for access to a public document should in itself have caused the university to avoid measures leading to further delay in releasing the documents despite this in its interpretation of the conditions and in laying down additional conditions the university made it more difficult for k and e to gain access to the documents the applicant s liability the prosecutor has maintained that after the judgments of the administrative court of appeal august and until may when the material is said to be destroyed the applicant in his capacity as head of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry has wilfully disregarded the obligations of his office by failing to comply with the judgments of the administrative court of appeal and allow e and k access to the documents according to the indictment the applicant in so doing has not only refused to release the documents on his own account but also refused to make the documents available to the university administration the research material was the property of the university and hence to be regarded as in the public domain it was stored in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry where the applicant was the head the vice-chancellor s letter of august to which copies of the judgments of the administrative court of appeal relating to the conditions were attached made it clear to the applicant that the material in question must be released as head of the department the applicant was responsible for making the material available to k and e the applicant s awareness of his immediate responsibility is revealed not least by the instructions that he gave to l before the visit of p not to allow the university administration access to the material it is also shown by the applicant s written reply on august to the vice-chancellor through the vice-chancellor the university had instructed the applicant to release the material to the university so that it could be moved to premises where k and e could examine it in view of this the court of appeal like the district court does not consider that the applicant can be held culpable because he refused on his own account to hand over the documents however it was incumbent upon him to make the documents available for removal in accordance with the instructions he had received from the university the applicant has protested that he did not consider that there was any serious intent behind the instruction he received from the vice-chancellor on august here he has referred in particular to the meeting on august to the fact that p did not follow up his visit to the department and that he received no new directive to make the material available the vice-chancellor however has stated that on no occasion did he withdraw the instructions issued on august and that it must have been quite clear to the applicant that they continued to apply even though they were not explicitly repeated according to the vice-chancellor nothing transpired at the meeting on august that could have given the applicant the impression that these instructions no longer applied or that they were not intended seriously the vice-chancellor s statement in this respect has been confirmed by the director at the vice-chancellor s office w. it is further borne out by the fact that after the meeting on august w was given the task of drawing up a complaint to the government disciplinary board for higher officials on the subject of the applicant s refusals and that the latter was aware that a complaint of this kind was being considered in addition it can be seen from a number of e-mails from the applicant to the vice-chancellor that during the entire autumn he considered that he was required to hand over the documents and that he maintained his original refusal to obey his instructions it has also been shown that when the board met on december the vice-chancellor was still considering making a complaint to the disciplinary board finally a witness aw has testified that at a meeting with the applicant shortly after the beginning of when asked whether he still persisted in his refusal he confirmed that this was the case all things considered the court of appeal finds that it has been shown that the applicant was aware of the instructions to make the material available to the administration applied during the entire period from when he learnt about the judgments of the administrative court of appeal on august it was incumbent on him to take the actions required to comply with the judgments the applicant has stated that he was never prepared to participate in the release of the documents to k and e. his actions were in other words intentional and their result has been that k and e were categorically denied a right that is guaranteed by the constitution and that is also of fundamental importance in principle all things considered the court of appeal finds that the applicant s actions mean that he disregarded the obligation that applied to him as head of department in such a manner that the offence of misuse of office should be considered the applicant has however also objected that his actions should be regarded as excusable in view of the other considerations that he had to bear in mind he has thus claimed that in the situation that had arisen he was prevented by medical ethics and research ethics from disclosing information about the participants in the study and their relatives he referred in particular to international declarations drawn up by the world medical association and to the convention the nature of the international declarations agreed on by the world medical association is not such as to give precedence over swedish law the applicant s objections on the basis of the contents of these declarations therefore lack significance in this case article of the convention lays down that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life home and also that this right may not be interfered with by a public body except in certain specified cases the provisions of the secrecy act are intended in accordance with article of the convention to protect individuals from the disclosure to others of information about their personal circumstances in cases other than those that can be regarded as acceptable with regard to the right to insight into the workings of the public administration these regulations must be considered to comply with the requirements of the convention and the judgments of the administrative court of appeal lay down how they are to be interpreted in this particular case the applicant s objection that his action was excusable in the light of the convention can not therefore be accepted the applicant has also asserted that he risked criminal prosecution for breach of professional secrecy if he released the documents to k and e however the judgments of the administrative court of appeal had determined once and for all that the secrecy act permitted release of the documents for this reason there was of course no possibility of prosecution for breach of professional secrecy which in the opinion of the court of appeal the applicant must have realised the applicant has also stated that he was bound by the assurances of confidentiality he had given to the participants in the study in accordance with the requirements established for the research project the assurances were given in and had the following wording all data will be dealt with in confidence and classified as secret no data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place no information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she/he took part in a study undertaken by and its present results will as was the case for the previous study three years ago be followed up. a later assurance of confidentiality had the following wording participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you. the assurances of confidentiality given to those participants in the study go at least in some respects further than the secrecy acts permits the court of appeal notes that there is no possibility in law to provide greater secrecy than follows from the secrecy act and that it is not possible to make decisions on issues concerning confidentiality until the release of a document is requested it follows therefore that the assurances of confidentiality cited above did not take precedence over the law as it stands or a court s application of the statutes the applicant s objections therefore have no relevance in assessing his criminal liability finally the applicant has claimed that his actions were justifiable in view of the discredit that swedish research would incur and the decline in willingness to participate in medical research projects that would ensue if information submitted in confidence were then to be disclosed to private individuals the court of appeal notes that there are other possibilities of safeguarding research interests for example by removing details that enable identification from research material so that sensitive information can not be divulged what the applicant has adduced on this issue can not exonerate him from liability the applicant s actions were therefore not excusable on the contrary for a considerable period he failed to comply with his obligations as a public official arising from the judgments of the administrative court of appeal his offence can not be considered a minor one the applicant shall therefore be found guilty of misuse of office for the period after august when he was informed of the judgments of the administrative court of appeal the offence is a serious one as the applicant wilfully disregarded the constitutional right of access to public documents on the question of the sentence the court of appeal concurs with the judgment of the district court leave to appeal to the supreme court was refused on april the principle of public access to official documents offenligthetsprincipen has a history of more than two hundred years in and is one of the cornerstones of swedish democracy one of its main characteristics is the constitutional right for everyone to study and be informed of the contents of official documents held by the public authorities this principle allows for the public and the media to exercise control of the state the municipalities and other parts of the public sector which in turn contributes to the free exchange of opinions and ideas and to efficient and correct management of public administration and thereby to maintaining the legitimacy of the democratic system see govt bill p. et seq. the principle of public access to official documents is enshrined in chapter sections and of the freedom of the press act thus every swedish citizen shall be entitled to have free access to official documents in order to encourage the free exchange of opinion and the availability of comprehensive information chapter section foreign nationals enjoy the same rights in this respect as swedish citizens chapter section a document is official if it is held by and is regarded as having been received or drawn up by a public authority chapter sections and of the freedom of the press act a document is drawn up when it is dispatched by an authority a document that is not dispatched is drawn up when the matter to which it relates is finally settled by the authority in question in case the document does not belong to any specific matter it is drawn up when it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form as research is considered to be an activity in its own right faktiskt handlande see for example the chancellor of justice p. it can not be said to belong to any specific matter this means in turn that research material as a rule is drawn up and thereby official as soon as it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form it could be added that preliminary outlines drafts and similar documents enumerated in chapter section of the freedom of the press act are not deemed to be official unless they introduce new factual information or have been accepted for filing finally there is no general requirement that a document be filed in order to be considered official and registration does not affect the issue of whether a document is official or not cf chapter section of the secrecy act an official document to which the public has access shall be made available on request forthwith or as soon as possible at the place where it is held and free of charge to any person wishing to examine it in such form that it can be read listened to or otherwise comprehended a document may also be copied reproduced or used for sound transmission chapter section such a decision should normally be rendered the same day or if the public authority in question has to consider whether the requested document is official or whether the information is public within a few days see for example the parliamentary ombudsman s decision of november in case no a certain delay may also be acceptable if the request concerns very extensive material if a document can not be made available without disclosure of such part of it as constitutes classified material the rest of the document shall be made available to the applicant in the form of a transcript or copy section a public authority is under no obligation to make a document available at the place where it is held if this presents serious difficulty an unlimited right of public access to official documents could however result in unacceptable harm to different public and private interests it has therefore been considered necessary to provide exceptions these exceptions are laid down in chapter section first paragraph of the freedom of the press act which reads as follows the right of access to official documents may be restricted only if restriction is necessary having regard to the security of the state or its relations with another state or an international organisation the central fiscal monetary or currency policy of the state the inspection control or other supervisory activities of a public authority the interest of preventing or prosecuting crime the economic interest of the public institutions the protection of the personal or economic circumstances of private subjects the preservation of animal or plant species according to paragraph of the same provision restrictions on the right of access to official documents shall be scrupulously specified in a provision of a special act of law or if this is deemed more appropriate in a particular case in another act of law to which the special act refers see for example govt bill p. et seq and govt bill part a p. et seq. the special act of law referred to is the secrecy act sekretesslagen sfs pursuant to such a provision the government may issue more detailed provisions for its application in an ordinance förordning since the mandate to restrict the right of public access to official documents lies exclusively with the swedish parliament riksdag it is not possible for a public authority to enter into an agreement with a third party exempting certain official documents from the right of public access to official documents or to make similar arrangements the secrecy act contains provisions regarding the duty to observe secrecy in the activities of the community and regarding prohibitions against making official documents available chapter section of act in the latter respect the provisions limit the right of access to official documents provided for in the freedom of the press act tryckfrihetsförordningen sfs the provisions relate to prohibitions against disclosing information irrespective of the manner of disclosure the question of whether secrecy shall apply to information contained in an official document can not be determined in advance but shall be examined each time a request for access to a document is made decisive for this issue is whether making a document available could imply a certain risk of harm the risk of harm is defined in different ways in the secrecy act having regard to the interests that the secrecy is intended to protect thus the secrecy may be more or less strict depending on the interests involved the secrecy legislation has been elaborated in this way in order to provide sufficient protection for example for the personal integrity of individuals without the constitutional right of public access to official documents being circumscribed more than considered necessary in the present case the administrative court of appeal in its judgments of february found that secrecy applied to the research material under chapter sections and of the secrecy act chapter deals with secrecy with regard to the protection of the personal circumstances of individuals if a public authority deems that such risk of loss harm or other inconvenience which pursuant to a provision on secrecy constitutes an obstacle to information being communicated to a private subject can be removed by the imposition of a restriction which limits the private subject s right to re-communicate or use the information the authority shall impose such a restriction when the information is communicated chapter section of the secrecy act as an example of such a restriction the preparatory notes mention a prohibition against disseminating the content of a document or against publishing secret information contained in a document see govt bill part a p. an individual who has been granted access to a document subject to a restriction limiting the right to use the information may be held criminally liable if he or she does not respect such a restriction see chapter section of the penal code a request to examine an official document shall be made to the public authority which holds the document chapter section of the freedom of the press act and chapter section of the secrecy act as mentioned above there are specific requirements of speediness regarding the handling of such requests a decision by an authority other than the swedish parliament or the government to refuse access to a document is subject to appeal to the courts as a general rule an administrative court of appeal and further to the supreme administrative court chapter section of the freedom of the press act chapter section of the secrecy act and sections and of the administrative court procedure act förvaltningsprocesslagen sfs leave to appeal is required in the last mentioned court only the applicant has a right of appeal thus if the administrative court of appeal contrary to the public authority holding the document in question decides that a document shall be made available its judgment may not be appealed against by the public authority in question or private subjects who consider that harm would be inflicted on them as a consequence of the fact that access to the document is granted see rå note and rå ref the reason why the right of appeal has been narrowly limited is that once the competing interests have been considered by a court the legislator has given priority to the principle of public access to official documents over other private and public interests see for example govt bill p. and rå ref which concerned the applicant s request for relief for substantive defects the principle of public access to official documents is applicable to all activities within the public sector and every public official is obliged to be acquainted with laws and regulations in this area this is in particular the case where a certain official following a special decision or otherwise has the duty to examine requests for access to official documents chapter section second paragraph of the secrecy act formally the head of the public authority has the primary responsibility to ensure that such requests are duly examined however the task may be delegated to other office holders within the authority and this is what is also done in practice for the purposes of the authority s daily activities such delegation has to be in accordance with the regulations of the authority section of the former government agencies and institutes ordinance verkförordningen sfs applicable at the relevant time irrespective of whether a public official has certain competence or power under the regulations of the authority in question he or she has a general duty to perform the tasks that are part of his or her official duties as previously mentioned this duty involves the obligation to assist in making official documents available forthwith or as soon as possible to persons who are considered to have the right of access to them under the legislation described above a person who in the exercise of public authority by act or by omission intentionally or through carelessness disregards the duties of his office shall be sentenced for misuse of office tjänstefel to a fine or imprisonment of a maximum of two years chapter section of the penal code if having regard to the perpetrator s official powers or the nature of his office considered in relation to his exercise of public power in other respects or having regard to other circumstances the act may be regarded as petty punishment shall not be imposed if a crime mentioned in the first paragraph has been committed intentionally and is regarded as gross a sentence for gross misuse of office to imprisonment of a minimum of six months and a maximum of six years shall be imposed members of a national or municipal decision-making assembly shall not be held responsible under the provisions previously mentioned for any action taken in such capacity nor shall the said provisions apply if the offence is subject to a punishment under another provision of the penal code or some other law concerning the question of sanctions a conditional sentence may be imposed by the courts for an offence for which the sanction of a fine is considered inadequate and such a sentence shall as a general rule be combined with a day-fine maximum day-fines see chapter sections and chapter section of the penal code the day-fine may not exceed swedish kronor sek see chapter section of the penal code when determining the amount account is taken of the economic circumstances of the accused the relevant provision of the swedish penal code brottsbalken reads as follows chapter article a person who in the exercise of public authority by act or by omission intentionally or through carelessness disregards the duties of his office shall be sentenced for misuse of office to a fine or a maximum term of imprisonment of two years if having regard to the perpetrator s official powers or the nature of his office considered in relation to his exercise of public power in other respects or having regard to other circumstances the act may be regarded as petty punishment shall not be imposed if an offence mentioned in the first paragraph has been committed intentionally and is regarded as serious the perpetrator shall be sentenced for gross misuse of office to a term of imprisonment of at least six months and at most six years in assessing whether the crime is serious special attention shall be given to whether the offender seriously abused his position or whether the crime occasioned serious harm to an individual or the public sector or gave rise to a substantial improper benefit a member of a national or municipal decision-making assembly shall not be held responsible under the provisions of the first or second paragraphs of this article for any action taken in that capacity nor shall the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of this article apply if the crime is punishable under this or some other law law the functions and powers of the four parliamentary ombudsmen are laid down in particular in chapter section of the instrument of government regeringsformen and in the act with instructions for the parliamentary ombudsmen lagen med instruktion för riksdagens ombudsmän their main task is to supervise the application of laws and other regulations within public administration it is their particular duty to ensure that courts and administrative authorities observe the provisions of the constitution regarding objectivity and impartiality and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens are not encroached upon in the process of public administration an ombudsman exercises supervision either on complaint from individuals or of his or her own motion by carrying out inspections and other investigations which he or she deems necessary the examination of a matter is concluded by a decision in which the ombudsman states his or her opinion on whether the measure of the authority contravenes the law or is otherwise wrongful or inappropriate the ombudsmen may also make pronouncements aimed at promoting uniform and proper application of the law an ombudsman s decisions are considered to be expressions of his or her own personal opinion they are not legally binding upon the authorities however they are of persuasive force command respect and are usually followed in practice an ombudsman may among many other things institute criminal proceedings against an official who has committed an offence by departing from the obligations incumbent on him or her in his or her official duties for example as in the present case misuse of office the ombudsman may also report an official for disciplinary measures to those who have the competence to decide on such measures the ombudsman may be present at the deliberations of the courts and the administrative authorities and is entitled to have access to their minutes and other documents it follows from chapter section of the tort liability act skadeståndslagen sfs that the state is liable to pay compensation for inter alia financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority from chapter section of the act it follows that under certain circumstances the state is liable to pay compensation for financial loss caused by an erroneous instruction or advice given by an authority in a judgment of june nja p. the supreme court found that an individual had a right to bring a civil action against the state before the national courts on the ground that there had been a violation of article of the convention because a criminal case against the individual had not been concluded within a reasonable time in a decision of may the supreme court held that the principle established in nja p. also applied with regard to the rights contained in article of the convention the supreme court has subsequently in a judgment on september nja p. found that individuals have a right to bring civil suits against the state for violations of any articles of the convention when the state according to the convention has an obligation to pay damages for the violation and such obligation can not be based on national legislation in the same case the court of appeal also concluded in a judgment dated january that there had been a violation of article and that non-pecuniary damages should be awarded on the basis of the principle established in nja p. a further supreme court judgment of november nja p. concerned a claim for damages against the on the basis of an alleged violation of article of the convention relating to the plaintiffs father s suicide while in detention the supreme court concluded that the case revealed no violation of article but noted that the right to an effective remedy in such a case should in principle include a possibility of obtaining compensation for damage finally in a decision of october concerning a claim for damages against the swedish state the chancellor of justice justitskanslern concluded that the individual concerned was entitled to compensation from the state for non-pecuniary damage on account of excessive length of civil proceedings anyone who wishes to claim compensation from the state for financial loss which he or she considers has been caused by a wrongful decision taken by a court or an administrative state authority may proceed in either of the two different ways he or she may either petition the chancellor of justice in accordance with section of the ordinance on the administration of claims for damages against the state förordningen om handläggning av skadeståndsanspråk mot staten sfs or bring a civil action against the state in the ordinary courts no appeal lies against a decision of the chancellor of justice however if the claim is rejected the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts the helsinki declaration adopted by the world medical association s general assembly helsinki in in june with later amendments states inter alia introduction the world medical association wma has developed the declaration of helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects including research on identifiable human material and data the declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs although the declaration is addressed primarily to physicians the wma encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles it is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients including those who are involved in medical research the physician s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty the declaration of of the wma binds the physician with the words the health of my patient will be my first consideration and the international code of medical ethics declares that a physician shall act in the patient s best interest when providing medical care medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research in medical research involving human subjects the well-being of the individual research subject must take precedence over all other interests physicians should consider the ethical legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards no national or international ethical legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this declaration basic principles for all medical research it is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life health dignity integrity right to self-determination privacy and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects the design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described in a research protocol the protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this declaration have been addressed the protocol should include information regarding funding sponsors institutional affiliations other potential conflicts of interest incentives for subjects and provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study the protocol should describe arrangements for post-study access by study subjects to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or access to other appropriate care or benefits the research protocol must be submitted for consideration comment guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins this committee must be independent of the researcher the sponsor and any other undue influence it must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this declaration the committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies the researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee especially information about any serious adverse events no change to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on their physical mental and social integrity in medical research involving competent human subjects each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims methods sources of funding any possible conflicts of interest institutional affiliations of the researcher the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail and any other relevant aspects of the study the potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information after ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject s freely-given informed consent preferably in writing if the consent can not be expressed in writing the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed,case originated application lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms

the case originated in an application no against the lodged with the european commission of human rights the commission under former article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a finnish national ms anne nikula the applicant on may the applicant alleged that her freedom of expression had been infringed on account of her having been convicted of defamation for having criticised in her capacity as defence counsel the public prosecutor 's decisions to press charges against a certain person thereby preventing the applicant 's client from examining him as a witness and not to charge another person who had therefore been able to testify against the applicant 's client the application was transmitted to the court on november when protocol no to the convention came into force article of protocol no the application was allocated to the fourth section of the court rule of the rules of court within that section the chamber that would consider the case article of the convention was constituted as provided in rule by a decision of november the chamber declared the application partly admissible note by the registry the court 's decision is obtainable from the registry the applicant and the government each filed observations on the merits rule in addition third-party comments were received from interights the international centre for the legal protection of human rights which had been given leave by the president to intervene in the written procedure article of the convention and rule the parties replied to those comments rule a hearing on the merits of the case took place in public in the on september rule there appeared before the court a for the government b for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr kosonen mr sundström and mr välimaa on november the court changed the composition of its sections rule but this case remained with the chamber constituted within the former fourth section in the applicant appeared as defence counsel in the kokkola city court raastuvanoikeus rådstuvurätt in two sets of criminal proceedings against her client i.s and others the applicant acted as counsel under the cost-free proceedings act laki maksuttomasta oikeudenkäynnistä lag om fri rättegång with the city court 's consent in the trial the public prosecutor t. requested that i.s. his brother s.s. and l.o be temporarily barred from conducting business liiketoimintakielto näringsförbud the request had been triggered by the winding up of various companies which the defendants had owned or in which they had held positions of trust at a hearing on march t. argued inter alia that regardless of whether s.s. had actually participated in the administration of the companies he should be barred from conducting business given his formal membership of their boards of directors evidence was heard from the companies bookkeeper m.h. who was one of the witnesses those proceedings ended with a decision of february rendered by the supreme court korkein oikeus högsta domstolen in the meantime i.s. s.s. l.o and m.h had been questioned as suspects in relation to a complaint lodged by m.s the wife of s.s. alleging that they had among other things abused their positions of trust within one of the companies on december t. decided not to bring charges against s.s. having found no evidence that he had participated in any meeting of the board at which the funds invested by the complainant had been allocated for purposes to which she had not agreed or that s.s. had otherwise consented to such allocation on february i.s was charged with aiding and abetting fraud and abusing a position of trust l.o was accused inter alia of aggravated fraud and fraud whereas m.h was charged with abusing a position of trust the public prosecutor t. had summoned s.s. to testify but the applicant and the other defence counsel objected to this on behalf of their clients before the city court the applicant read out and handed in a memorial entitled role manipulation and unlawful presentation of evidence in finnish roolimanipulointi ja kiellonvastainen todistelu in which among other arguments she made the following points the indictment seeks to hide the fact that s.s. was chairman of the board of the company in question the blatant abuse in respect of the presentation of evidence must lead the court to reject such evidence the prosecutor 's arrangement shows that he seeks by means of procedural tactics to make a witness out of a co-accused so as to support the indictment in order to prevent the accused from submitting evidence on those points the prosecutor has in the same case brought trumped-up charges against a person who would qualify as a witness such deliberate abuse of discretion on the part of a public authority is highly unusual in a state governed by the rule of law as regards in particular the procedural tactics which the prosecutor has adopted in the present case namely as many as two instances of role manipulation in one and the same case i submit that a milder form of such manipulation has been condemned by the norwegian supreme court that precedent disclosed unlawful behaviour similar to that of the prosecutor in the present case the prosecutor has in this case committed role manipulation thereby breaching his official duties and jeopardising legal security t. having denied the above allegations and maintained his request the city court rejected the objection of the defence and allowed s.s. to testify on february the defendants were convicted i.s and l.o were given suspended prison sentences and fines and m.h sentenced to fines they were all ordered to pay damages and costs all appealed i.s and l.o arguing inter alia that s.s. should not have been heard as a witness in its judgment of december the vaasa court of appeal hovioikeus hovrätt upheld the decision to hear s.s. as a witness but acquitted i.s and m.h of the charges regarding abuse of a position of trust they were nonetheless ordered to pay damages to the complainant m.h and t. requested leave to appeal to the supreme court having been invited to comment on t. 's request the applicant maintained on behalf of i.s that s.s. should not have been heard as a witness leave to appeal was granted to m.h only in its decision of march the supreme court set aside the order requiring m.h to pay damages t. reported the applicant 's statements of february to the prosecuting counsel kanneviskaali hovrättsfiskalen of the court of appeal for consideration of possible defamation charges on december the acting prosecuting counsel formed the view that the applicant had been guilty of defamation but decided not to indict her since the offence had been of a minor character the acting prosecuting counsel gave the following reasons among others the defamation now in question can not be expected to result in a more severe punishment than a fine the applicant made her aforementioned submission in order to prevent the examination of s.s. as witness by acting in this manner the applicant attempted to defend her client 's interests in the trial in her submission she attempted perhaps in part due to her inexperience to place the case before the city court in the context of the norwegian precedent and its formulations the submission was thereby worded quite sharply with the effect of offending t. although the applicant was not able to show the requisite factual grounds for the allegations concerning t. at the same hearing the city court found no obstacles to examining s.s. as a witness in its reasons the city court noted that no elements had transpired from the pre-trial record or other material on the basis of which the prosecutor could be seen as having deliberately selected certain persons as the accused in the case the court of appeal did not reverse that decision of the city court in the circumstances the applicant 's offence has not caused any particularly significant harm to t. using his independent right of private prosecution t. nevertheless brought criminal proceedings against the applicant in the court of appeal before the court of appeal the applicant argued that as defence counsel she had to be afforded far-reaching freedom of expression prosecutors and legal counsel were obliged to tolerate criticism to a much wider extent than private individuals the applicant 's statements had been addressed exclusively to the city court and had been limited to criticising the procedure which t. as prosecutor had adopted in her client 's case as the city court had dismissed the applicant 's objection to hearing s.s. as a witness the statements could not qualify as defamatory within the meaning of chapter article of the penal code rikoslaki strafflag t. argued that the applicant 's statements to the city court on february were capable of subjecting him to contempt and hampering the performance of his professional duties and his career he referred to his lengthy service as public prosecutor to his municipal position of trust and to his chairmanship of the local branch of a political party on august the court of appeal convicted the applicant of public defamation committed without better knowledge julkinen ei vastoin parempaa tietoa tehty herjaus offentlig smädelse dock inte emot bättre vetande i.e negligent defamation to be distinguished from public defamation despite better knowledge that is to say intentionally imputing an offence to t. whilst knowing that he had not committed it rather than voicing a mere suspicion that he had the applicant was sentenced to a fine of markkas fim euros eur she was further ordered to pay fim eur in damages for the harm suffered by t. and fim eur for his costs both sums with interest lastly she was ordered to pay fim eur in costs to the state the court of appeal gave the following reasons among others the obligation of an advocate is to safeguard his or her client 's interests within the confines of the law and good advocacy ethics the requirements relating to an advocate 's activities appear in rather general provisions and rules according to generally recognised principles an accused must be provided with all necessary guarantees for his or her defence similarly an advocate may request that every aspect of his or her client 's case be correctly and properly dealt with by the court counsel is under a duty to point out the errors and deficiencies which he or she notices to this end an advocate is free to criticise anything of relevance to the case such criticism must nonetheless be appropriate and based on facts the grounds for the criticism must be carefully considered the manner in which an advocate proceeds is also limited inter alia by the provisions in chapter of the penal code in the present case it has been established that the applicant alleged in her aforementioned written submission that t. had in assessing who should be charged in the case deliberately abused his discretion and thereby breached his official duties was thus accused of an intentional offence in office within the meaning of chapter article of the penal code the applicant 's conduct would constitute a criminal offence if her statements were capable of subjecting t. to contempt or of hampering the performance of his duties or career on this point the court of appeal notes that the statement was made by a legal practitioner trained as a judge varatuomari vicehäradshövding the statements were made at a public hearing before the city court the statement may thus have spread into the public domain the statements concerning the abuse of discretion in breach of official duties may therefore have subjected t. to contempt or may have hampered the performance of his duties or his career progress t. had decided not to bring charges against s.s. in the absence of evidence sufficient for an indictment the court of appeal notes that no elements have transpired which would lead it to believe that t. 's aforementioned decision was not based on the appropriate reasons set out in the decision in its decision made at the same hearing the city court found no obstacle to examining s.s. as witness in its judgment of december the court of appeal did not reverse the city court 's decision on the basis of the charges which t. brought against m.h the city court convicted him of having abused a position of trust in its aforementioned judgment the court of appeal acquitted m.h but upheld the city court 's decision in respect of his obligation to pay damages the court of appeal notes that in this respect no elements have transpired which would lead it to believe that t. decided to bring charges against m.h so as to prevent his being examined as a witness the behaviour imputed to t. has not been proved there is no reason to believe that the applicant acted with intent although she did express her criticism in a manner defaming t. in order to defend her client 's interests the applicant attempted to prevent s.s. from being heard as a witness and to put forward elements relating to his credibility the applicant was in principle entitled to criticise the public prosecutor and to voice her suspicion that the prosecutor had acted incorrectly in the assessment of the applicant 's guilt no reason has been disclosed for reaching any conclusion other than that she failed to take sufficient care in considering the grounds for her criticism the court of appeal therefore concludes that the applicant did not act contrary to her better knowledge she must have realised however that her statements were defamatory in nature and were capable of subjecting t. to contempt or of hampering the exercise of his official duties or career both t. and the applicant appealed to the supreme court on february korkein oikeus the supreme court sitting as a chamber of five judges with justice tulenheimo-takki holding a casting vote upheld the court of appeal 's reasons but set aside the applicant 's sentence considering that her offence had been minor in nature accordingly the fine imposed on her was lifted but her obligation to pay damages and costs was upheld justices krook and vuori voted in favour of upholding the court of appeal 's judgment as a whole whereas justices lehtimaja and portin found that the applicant should be acquitted and relieved of her obligation to pay damages according to the voting procedure laid down in chapter article of the code of judicial procedure oikeudenkäymiskaari rättegångs balk the judges in favour of imposing a penalty on the applicant were considered to form the majority and the more lenient of the two views within that majority prevailed justice lehtimaja whose opinion was joined by justice portin reasoned as follows this case concerns on the one hand the freedom of speech of the defence lawyer of an accused in criminal proceedings and on the other hand the threshold for considering criticism of a public prosecutor 's official actions a criminal offence it is in the nature of a fair trial that counsel for the defence must if the client 's best interests so require be free to criticise the public prosecutor 's official actions without thereby being threatened with punishment this is considered to be an essential principle of human rights in the western countries where the rule of law prevails the principle becomes devoid of meaning if defence counsel 's freedom of expression is excessively restricted in such a situation legal provisions which restrict this freedom of expression must therefore be interpreted narrowly correspondingly one can expect a public prosecutor to tolerate even sharp criticism of his or her official actions at a public hearing this is due to the specific nature of the post of public prosecutor the act imputed to the applicant on the basis of the court of appeal 's reasoning i consider that the applicant did not have any intention to offend t. or to act contrary to her better knowledge the question is therefore whether she is guilty of the defamation imputed to her by the court of appeal in the trial in question the applicant considered the interests of her client to require that the prosecution witness be disqualified from testifying against his brother to this end the applicant stated her suspicion that t. in considering whether to press charges had been guilty of role manipulation the applicant considered it necessary to stress in particular that such action was in her opinion incompatible with finnish law and therefore in breach of the duties of the prosecutor as her client 's defence counsel the applicant had a right to express such opinions and as a public prosecutor t. was obliged to tolerate such criticism as a party to the proceedings t. had an opportunity to respond to the applicant 's statements and dismiss the opposing party 's suspicions if he regarded them as groundless on the other hand there was no need for the applicant in her capacity as defence counsel to state her opinion as to whether t. had possibly committed an offence in office by acting in the alleged manner in this respect i consider the applicant 's statements inappropriate constitutive elements of defamation but did the applicant commit defamation is it enough for the fulfilment of the elements in chapter article of the penal code to allege that someone is 'guilty of a specific offence in the circumstances mentioned in this provision or is it also required that the alleged offence is capable of subjecting the said person 'to contempt or harming his professional life or career the provision is linguistically open to various interpretations the court of appeal has applied the interpretation which is more favourable to the accused by finding that her conduct would constitute a criminal offence only if her statements were capable of subjecting t. to contempt or of harming his professional life or career i agree with the court of appeal 's interpretation considering the broad definition of this offence it is not reasonable to consider that any allegation of an offence would suffice to cause the injurious consequences mentioned in this provision in order for the definition of defamation to be satisfied evidence is therefore also required in a given case that the allegation of an offence did produce an injurious consequence assessment of the injurious character of the allegation of an offence it is common knowledge that the role of an accused person 's defence counsel includes criticising the prosecutor 's decision to bring charges this is almost a rule especially when the charges against counsel 's client are denied it is also known that the language used by counsel may be sharp and counsel 's view particularly subjective the public present at a trial are therefore usually able to adopt a prudent attitude towards the criticism to which the parties subject each other neither is all criticism likely to be taken literally even if those who have presented it are legally trained as regards t. 's alleged role manipulation as such the applicant did not state that t. had done something he had not done instead she questioned the appropriateness of his decisions the applicant alleged that the actual purpose of t. 's actions had not corresponded to the stated grounds for the actions on that basis the applicant made known that she considered t. 's official actions unlawful and purposely harmful to her client despite their unconditional tone and formulation the applicant 's statements could be understood more or less as her own doubts as to the reasons why t. had acted the way he did conclusion in the light of the above-mentioned considerations i do not consider that the applicant 's allegation that t. had committed an offence in office was capable of subjecting him to contempt or of harming his professional life or career within the meaning of chapter article of the penal code therefore i consider it not proved that the applicant committed defamation i would quash the court of appeal 's judgment and dismiss the charges and compensation claims against the applicant costs in so far as court costs are concerned i consider despite the outcome of the case that the applicant given the inappropriate tone of her remarks gave cause for t. to initiate proceedings against her considering the facts i nonetheless find that both parties should bear their own costs. according to chapter article of the penal code as in force at the relevant time a person alleging albeit not contrary to his or her better knowledge that someone had committed an offence was to be convicted of defamation unless he or she could show probable cause in support of the allegation the current chapter article of the penal code as amended by law no provides that where criticism is aimed at the conduct of another person in his or her political or business activity public office or function scientific artistic or other comparable public activity and where this criticism clearly does not exceed the limits of acceptable conduct it shall not be considered defamation within the meaning of paragraph according to chapter article of the code of judicial procedure the court may order that an unsuitable legal representative should no longer appear in the case before it the court may also on similar grounds revoke the appointment of counsel instructed under the legal-aid scheme section of the cost-free proceedings act the intervener concluded from its survey of a number of member states of the council of europe i.e belgium denmark france italy the netherlands spain sweden and the united kingdom as well as of certain other states australia canada and south africa that a great majority of them accord a privilege to lawyers for statements they make while representing clients in court although the extent and application of such privilege may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction every surveyed state recognises that a lawyer 's ability to express himself or herself is closely linked to counsel 's obligation to defend the client the privilege for allegedly defamatory statements allows counsel to argue as effectively as possible relying even on facts which they can not be sure are true for example in the allegations that the prosecutor has abused his or her discretion are regularly made by defence lawyers potentially relevant allegations which are entirely unsubstantiated are simply disregarded to the extent that restrictions are permitted on a lawyer 's statements in court most of the jurisdictions surveyed by interights tend to favour the use of disciplinary measures over criminal sanctions in the view of the intervener this might reflect the position taken by the court in the context of article namely that a relatively light criminal sanction may already serve to chill even appropriate and measured criticism see for example the thorgeir thorgeirson v. iceland judgment of june series a no where criminal sanctions are permitted in theory in most of the jurisdictions surveyed by the intervener they are rarely used in practice and then usually only in extreme circumstances and provided that intent can be shown as opposed to mere negligence even where a lawyer 's statements may in principle be subject to restrictions those are generally imposed only when the statement is not only defamatory but also entirely unrelated to the proceedings or the parties furthermore almost all of the jurisdictions surveyed by the intervener recognise the fundamental difference between the roles of the prosecutor being the opponent of the accused and the judge this distinction generally provides an increased protection for statements that are critical of the prosecutor it is the intervener 's conclusion that in most of the surveyed jurisdictions it is unlikely that a defence lawyer would be criminally prosecuted for having criticised the manner in which a prosecutor is handling a case or for having indicated that the prosecutor has abused his or her discretion on such facts recourse to criminal proceedings would not be deemed necessary according to paragraph of the basic principles on the role of lawyers adopted in by the eighth united nations congress on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders lawyers should enjoy civil and penal immunity for relevant statements made in good faith in written or oral pleadings in their professional appearances before a court tribunal or other legal or administrative authority in its recommendation the committee of ministers of the council of europe recommends the governments of member states to take or reinforce as the case may be all measures they consider necessary with a view to implementing the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer for instance lawyers should not suffer or be threatened with any sanctions or pressure when acting in accordance with their professional standards lawyers should however respect the judiciary and carry out their duties towards the court in a manner consistent with domestic legal and other rules and professional standards principles and,case

the case originated in an application no against the republic of hungary lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a hungarian national mr krisztián ungváry and a limited liability company irodalom kulturális szolgáltató kft irodalom kft on october the applicants were represented by ms a. csapó a lawyer practising in budapest the hungarian government the government were represented by mr z. tallódi agent ministry of public administration and justice the applicants alleged in particular that the civil proceedings for defamation brought against them and the order to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage had breached their right to freedom of expression on february the application was communicated to the government it was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time article the first applicant was born in and lives in budapest the second applicant irodalom kft is a hungarian limited liability company with its seat in budapest mr ungváry is a well-reputed historian specialised in century hungarian history including state security under the communist regime irodalom kft is the publisher of the literary and political weekly élet és irodalom on may élet és irodalom published a study entitled the genesis of a procedure dialógus in pécs written by mr ungváry the article dealt with the actions of the security service against a spontaneous student peace movement dialógus active in pécs and elsewhere in the country in the the author stated inter alia that the dialógus-affair had demonstrated how closely the ministry of the interior and the ‘ social organisations which had taken over some state-security functions covertly in case of necessity had been intertwined the lead of the article pointed out that the recent scandals exposing former agents acting for the party-state s security system covered up the fact that most reporting for that system had been done through accidental social or official contacts as had been the case with a mr k. a judge of the constitutional court at the material time elected by parliament rather than by actual agents the lead contained the following passage from the perspective of informing besúgás and repression megtorlás officer j. w. and the nine official contacts hivatalos kapcsolat proved to be a lot more important in the dialógus-affair these official contacts including mr k. today judge of the constitutional court their respective responsibilities are of course different. the author argued that mr k. without being an actual agent was in regular and apparently collegial kollégiális contact with the state security quite often anticipating and exceeding its expectations and as an official contact he was busy as an informant besúgó and demanding hard-line policies the writing made reference to the role of further contemporary public figures amongst others the prime minister a member of the european economic and social committee a former member of parliament and a university professor in the article mr ungváry relied inter alia on documents available in the historical archives of the state security service archived as a strictly confidential action plan referring to the above material he described the role played by leaders of pécs university including mr k. deputy secretary of the local party committee between and in assisting the security operations mr ungváry characterised mr k. s attitude in the dialógus case as that of a hardliner in comparison to other social contacts he recalled that mr k. had ordered the removal of dialógus s poster saying that the country did not need such an organisation i.e dialógus and that he had reproached a candidate in the communist youth organisation s elections for having been supported by dialógus in its next issue of may élet és irodalom published mr k. s statement written in response to the disputed article denying the allegations on may a television channel broadcast an interview with mr ungváry about the article published in élet és irodalom he reiterated his argument that in the previous political system most reporting had been done through accidental social or official contacts he argued that providing information writing reports or removing posters would have qualified as agent activities and mr k. had been responsible for at least one of them he called the latter ‘ trash mr k. initiated proceedings with a view to obtaining a rectification in the press refuting the applicants allegations his claim was sustained by the courts and the second applicant published a rectification on february in april a reference book co-authored by mr ungváry was published outlining the history of the communist state security and including a chapter with the full version of the article published in élet és irodalom on april an interview with mr ungváry appeared on an internet news portal concerning the release of the book where he called mr k. a party secretary writing mood reports mr k. filed a criminal complaint against mr ungváry on charges of libel in the course of the ensuing proceedings the latter apologised for having called him ‘ trash in the television interview the second-instance criminal court was of the view that the statements in question constituted opinions mr ungváry was acquitted on february meanwhile mr k. filed a defamation action against both applicants on february the budapest regional court found that mr ungváry had infringed mr k. s personality rights through his statements made in the study published in élet és irodalom the television interview and the book the second applicant was found to have violated mr k. s personality rights through publishing the study the court relied on section of the civil code relying in essence on the findings of fact established in the rectification proceedings see paragraph above the court established that mr ungváry and the publisher had disseminated false and unproven statements tarnishing the reputation of mr k. by maintaining that the latter had acted as a quasi-agent during the communist regime been an informant of and collaborated with the state security reported to them and carried out their orders and been a hardliner in the court further found that mr ungváry had falsely interpreted mr k. s political criticism towards a candidate in the communist youth organisation s elections as an action motivated by the state security the court ordered irodalom kft to pay hungarian forints huf approximately euros eur in respect of the article published in élet és irodalom mr ungváry was ordered to pay huf eur in damages on appeal on october the budapest court of appeal reversed this judgment and dismissed mr k. s action holding that the impugned statements were value-judgments with sufficient factual background however it found that mr ungváry had violated mr k. s right to honour by calling him ‘ trash this part of the judgment became final on mr k. s petition for review on june the supreme court reversed the second-instance decision as to the remainder of the case it found for mr k. ruling that his personality rights had been violated by the false impression given by the article in question that he had been a quasi-agent and an informant during communist times collaborated as an ‘ official contact with the state security and written reports for them countered the youth organisation official s election on the secret service s instigation and demanded hard-line policies in the court held that the article had not presented fact-driven conclusions of a historical research but mere defamatory and unsubstantiated statements about mr k. it further affirmed that the applicants had been required to prove the truth of these allegations but had provided no such factual background the supreme court observed that there was no evidence that mr k. s report within the party hierarchy on the dialógus-affair had been written on the commission instruction or expectation of the ministry of the interior the judgment contained in particular the following passages the concept of the author of the impugned article is in essence that during the communist regime the so-called ‘ official contacts also played an important role in the state security s activities in addition to the actual agents it is probably true that the ministry of the interior indeed considered certain officials as ‘ official contacts it can also be assumed that some of them occasionally cooperated with the state security as ‘ official contacts that is carried out state-security tasks surveyed reported in other words were active in the manner described by the author as ‘ unambiguously incarnating the activities of an agent however it is not possible to deduce from this potentiality the general conclusion that every single official acted as an ‘ official contact consequently in the absence of proven facts it is not acceptable to qualify all potentially available personalities i.e communist party secretaries as ‘ official contacts actually cooperating with the state security public opinion condemns those persons who cooperated with the state security even if they do not fall within the actual category of ‘ agent or ‘ informant therefore if someone is characterised without a proper ground as actually having carried out such activities this violates that person s reputation according to public opinion however mr ungváry has committed breaches of law also in addition to the authoring of the article which themselves have justified although all the breaches have originated in the article published in élet és irodalom the plaintiff s claim for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the statements made in the television broadcast and the book the supreme court establishes the further reasonable non-pecuniary damage due to the plaintiff in the amount of hungarian forints. the supreme court ordered the applicants jointly and severally to pay damages in the amount of hungarian forints huf approximately euros eur and accrued interest whereas mr ungváry had to pay another huf eur and accrued interest see paragraph above the legal costs to be borne by the applicants amounted to approximately eur not including the applicants own legal expenses the plaintiff s claim as to an obligation on the side of the respondents to publish a compensatory statement was rejected as having been inadequately formulated act no xx of on the constitution as amended and as in force at the material time provides as follows article in the republic of hungary everyone shall have the right to good reputation the inviolability of his home and the protection of privacy and personal data. article in the republic of hungary everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression and to receive and impart information of public interest. act no

the applicant is the president of an association for the protection of women victims of domestic violence she was convicted for stating that a certain d.o had abused his wife after she had sought shelter at the association s refuge for women the case concerns the applicant s complaint of the violation of her right to freedom of expression guaranteed by article of the convention the applicant was born in and lives in zagreb she was represented by mr i. jelavić a lawyer practising in zagreb the government were represented by their agent mrs š. stažnik the facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows the applicant is the president of the zagreb autonomous women s house autonomna ženska kuća zagreb hereinafter the association an association established with the aim of providing women victims of violence with support the association had intervened in a family dispute between a certain d.o and his wife c.o following a request for help from the latter c.o and the couple s minor daughter had stayed at the association s refuge for women from february to august afterwards c.o had taken the child abroad on september the national daily newspaper večernji list published an interview with d.o in which he alleged that the association was responsible for the fact that his daughter had been kidnapped by her mother who had fled with the child abroad later on the same day the applicant was invited to give a telephone interview about the case on a live radio show where she explained the circumstances of the association s actions in the case and denied its involvement in the kidnapping of the child according to the applicant d.o was also invited to join in the show but he never replied the transcript of the relevant parts of the interview reads as follows the host c.o came to you because she had been abused the applicant of course because she had been abused i was surprised that the journalist stated that having met d.o several times she had concluded that he was not an abuser i am literally asking that journalist how long she has been an expert in assessing whether or not somebody is an abuser in her role personally i would never have dared to come to such a conclusion also because it has been a well-known fact for the past twenty years that abusers abuse in the privacy of their own homes they are not rude or aggressive when they are in contact with the police or when they are in contact with doctors and say ‘ oh my that is horrible how could she slip and fall down the stairs like that when they speak to social workers they are always very polite and very cooperative the host and the police usually buy their story the applicant of course police officers are somehow always on the side of the man of course that is the tragedy and the perversion of the whole story of course the abusers will not or will very rarely in a low percentage of cases be equally rude and equally aggressive verbally or physically towards third parties to the outside world they always give a good impression of themselves and only their wives who are the victims know how they act within the four walls of their home the host so what is the aim of this pressure only to make the association accountable or tarnish its reputation or to accomplish something more concrete the applicant well i would not say so i would not say that it was only about that i would say that the issue is d.o. who was abusing his wife i m afraid i have to confirm that because practice not only that of the association but also that of all women s refuges in the world has shown that victims speak about only one third of what they have been through not everything that means that there was certainly much more to it than what c.o managed to tell us women are ashamed to speak about it in detail so i do not have any doubt that c.o was a victim of abuse perpetrated by her husband d.o however i would not say that the aim was to diminish the authority or reputation of the association i would say that it was an attempt but i dare say a poor one to present the abuser as the victim and the victim as the abuser so we switch roles which is absolutely unacceptable in domestic violence cases because this is a burning issue which will soon be confirmed by numbers which the association has managed to obtain on december d.o brought a private criminal prosecution against the applicant in the zagreb municipal criminal court općinski kazneni sud u zagrebu on charges of defamation relating to her allegations that he had abused his wife he provided a copy of the recording of the radio show and an expert report concerning its authenticity asking that those be admitted in evidence during the proceedings the first-instance court heard evidence from several witnesses the witness v.o stated that there had been a police intervention concerning problems between d.o and c.o. and the witness s.m.k also gave evidence to that effect on may the first-instance court acquitted the applicant that judgment was quashed on appeal and the case was remitted the zagreb county court županijski sud u zagrebu holding that the relevant facts should be established with the assistance of an expert and by questioning the radio show host in the resumed proceedings the first-instance court commissioned an expert report from a sworn-in court expert concerning the authenticity of the audio-recording of the radio show submitted by d.o on april the expert attested to the authenticity of the substance of the recording and provided a transcript of the applicant s interview the applicant challenged the findings of the expert asking for his opinion to be excluded from the case file in particular she argued that the expert had contacted d.o. s lawyer directly during the preparation of his report without going through official court channels on april the applicant sought the disqualification of the expert witness but her request was dismissed on the grounds that the expert had been authorised to take all necessary measures in preparing the report the first-instance court also dismissed the applicant s proposal that the radio show host and two other witnesses as well as one witness proposed by d.o. should be questioned on the grounds that their testimony was irrelevant because the expert witness had already been heard on may the first-instance court found the applicant guilty of insult finding that she had tarnished d.o. s honour and reputation by alleging that he had abused his wife it sanctioned the applicant with a judicial admonition sudska opomena and ordered her to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings in the amount of croatian kunas hrk approximately euros eur as well as the necessary expenses incurred to d.o and to his lawyer the amount of which was to be determined by a subsequent court decision the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows in the present case the court finds it established that the applicant s conduct comprised all subjective and objective characteristics of the criminal act of insult and not defamation namely the criminal act of defamation content-wise requires the stating of a fact which is presented as being true whereas it is untrue a statement which objectively interpreted contains reference to a certain event something which actually occurred whose truthfulness can be established in the same way for all people a factual statement may include a statement about a certain characteristic but only if it represents a certain physical or psychological characteristic whereas in all other cases a statement about a person s characteristic normally contains a judgment about the value of a person and therefore concerns the criminal act of insult and not defamation in the present case it has been established that the applicant called d.o an abuser which is not an event or a physical or psychological characteristic of d.o and can therefore only be interpreted as an expression of a negative attitude or negative opinion about the value of d.o as a person the truthfulness of which can not be assessed however it should be pointed out that the court established that d.o had not been convicted and that the applicant had never alleged that she suspected or knew that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him or that he had been convicted of possible domestic violence in the criminal act of insult the object of protection is an individual s honour that is the requirement to respect the person whereas the content of an insult consists in a disrespecting negative judgment on d.o. s value in this court s opinion the applicant overstepped the permissible limit by critically assessing in the said radio show d.o. s respect or failure to respect of a final and enforceable decision public criticism may relate to a critical attitude or opinion about a person s actions but may not include subjective insulting judgments by referring to d.o as an abuser the applicant stated a generally negative opinion of him which is objectively insulting for the person it is directed at in the light of the above the court considers that the impugned allegations made by the applicant on the radio show can not be considered justified criticism within the meaning of article of the criminal code which refers to the exclusion of unlawfulness in cases of criminal offences against honour and reputation namely the court has established on the basis of the applicant s manner of speech and by placing the disputed allegation in relation to and in the context of all the content of the disputed radio show that the applicant spoke about d.o in a condescending manner and presented a negative and insulting judgment about his value as a person. the first-instance court also dismissed the applicant s request for the expert opinion to be excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence but provided no reasoning as to why the radio show host had not been questioned on july the second-instance court dismissed an appeal by the applicant as ill-founded it held that although the first-instance court had failed to provide any reasons concerning the failure to question the radio show host that did not render the proceedings as a whole unfair given that there had been sufficient evidence for the applicant s conviction it also considered that the first-instance court had struck a fair balance between the applicant s freedom of expression and the protection of d.o. s rights the applicant challenged those findings before the constitutional court ustavni sud republike hrvatske which on december dismissed her complaints as ill-founded the constitutional court s decision was served on the applicant on december relevant domestic law has been cited in miljević v. croatia no june the relevant provisions of the criminal code kazneni zakon official gazette no with subsequent amendments provide as follows article a judicial admonition is a criminal sanction which may be imposed as a warning to the perpetrator of a criminal offence for which the law prescribes a prison sentence of up to one year or a fine if the perpetrator s modus operandi and the consequences of the crime suggest that the offence committed was light in nature it may also be imposed where in view of the circumstances regarding the perpetrator and particularly his or her attitude towards the victim and the compensation for the damage inflicted by the offence it is considered that the purpose of the sanction can be achieved without imposing a penalty. article whoever insults another through the press radio or television in front of a number of persons at a public assembly or in another way in

to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary court rule on october the commission s secretariat lodged in the registry the documents relating to the proceedings before the commission on november the government sent the court the international telecommunication union s reply to the questions that the government had put to it the hearing took place in public in the on the appointed day the court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant company the court heard addresses by mr jacot-guillarmod and mr kieffer for the government by mr frowein for the commission and by mr gullotti for the applicant company as well as their answers to its questions the agent of the government and counsel for the applicant company produced several documents at the hearing autronic ag is a limited company incorporated under swiss law and has its head office at dübendorf canton of zürich it specialises in electronics and in particular sells cm-diameter dish aerials for home use its application relates to the reception in of uncoded television programmes made and broadcast in the soviet union they are transmitted to the soviet satellite g-horizont also called which sends them back to receiving earth stations on soviet territory and these in turn distribute them to users the satellite is a telecommunications satellite and not a direct-broadcasting one it provides a fixed point-to-point radiocommunication service number of the radio regulations see paragraph below and uses the frequencies allotted to radiocommunications it also transmits telephone conversations telexes or telegrams and data in the only television broadcasts by satellite that could be received in by means of a dish aerial were those from g-horizont in the spring of autronic ag applied to the radio and television division of the head office of the national post and telecommunications authority ptt it requested permission to give a showing at the basle trade fair mustermesse from to april of the public television programme that it received direct from g-horizont by means of a private dish aerial its object being to give a demonstration of the technical capabilities of the equipment in order to promote sales of it the division wrote to the soviet union s embassy in berne which on april conveyed the soviet authorities consent for the duration of the fair on july autronic ag made a similar approach in order to give demonstrations at the fera exhibition which was to be held in zürich from august to september and covered the latest developments in radio television and electronics the radio and television division again applied to the soviet embassy but did not receive a reply on and july and on august it informed autronic ag that without the express consent of the soviet authorities it could not allow reception of the g-horizont broadcasts and that the radio regulations see paragraph below required it to prevent such reception the proceedings before the radio and television division as autronic ag was anxious to give further demonstrations it applied to the radio and television division on november for a declaratory ruling feststellungsverfügung that in particular reception for private use of uncoded television programmes from satellites such as g-horizont should not require the consent of the broadcasting state s authorities the applicant company relied on several arguments the confidentiality of a programme could not depend on the use of particular frequencies numbers of the radio regulations gave no indication of which kind of broadcast was to be kept confidential reception of radio and television programmes intended for and accessible to the general public could be made subject only to the award of a licence under swiss law which was available to everybody and lastly the reception in question did not infringe swiss legislation on intellectual property because while programmes taken individually could have the status of works the same was not true of a whole schedule on january the radio and television division rejected the applicant company s application stating that it could not grant a receiving licence without the consent of the broadcasting state s authorities the division noted that only duly approved earth stations were entitled to receive signals from telecommunications satellites in this connection it referred to number of the radio regulations under which each national authority could assign certain frequencies to point-to-point radiocommunications provided that the broadcasts were not intended for direct reception by the general public it also stressed the difference between broadcasting satellites and telecommunications satellites the former transmitted radio and television programmes to an undefined number of receiving stations within a given area on frequencies expressly reserved for direct reception while the latter were covered by the secrecy of broadcasts which all member states were obliged to ensure under article of the international telecommunication convention and numbers of the radio regulations see paragraphs and below it added lastly translation from german as to whether a broadcast is intended for direct reception by the general public the decisive factor is accordingly not the content of the radiocommunication transmitted a television programme for example but the mode of its transmission in other words its classification as a telecommunication it follows that radio or television programmes transmitted via a telecommunications satellite can not be received in a country unless the telecommunications authority of the broadcasting state has given its permission to the telecommunications authority of the receiving state this will ensure compliance with the provisions on the secrecy of telecommunications there is no apparent reason why telecommunications authorities should not be able to keep certain radiocommunications secret since they are under an obligation to ensure that the provisions of the international telecommunication convention and of the radio regulations are complied with on february autronic ag lodged an appeal beschwerde against the radio and television division s decision but this was rejected by the head office of the ptt on july the head office began by holding that it had jurisdiction and that the company had an interest worthy of protection in having the disputed decision set aside under section of the federal administrative procedure act it went on to set out its reasons for dismissing the appeal protection of the material information could not depend on whether the broadcasts were intended for the general public since as a rule it was not known at the time of transmission by telecommunications satellites which broadcasts were intended for general use furthermore article art of the european convention on human rights secured only the right to receive information from generally accessible sources which telecommunications satellites were not lastly it was irrelevant that the broadcasts were ultimately intended for general use as the obligation to keep the transmitted data secret subsisted at the time of broadcasting on september autronic ag lodged an administrative-law appeal with the federal court against the decision of the head office of the ptt it applied to have that decision set aside and sought a judgment which would clarify the legal situation for the future it asked the court in particular to rule that reception for private use of uncoded broadcasts emanating from telecommunications satellites and intended for the general public should not be subject to the broadcasting state s consent in reply to a request for information made by the radio and television division of the head office of the swiss ptt the head office of the soviet union s gostelradio said the following in a telex of february with reference to your letter of january we should like to inform you that the programmes transmitted by ‘ stationar g-horizont are not satellite broadcasts intended for foreign countries the programmes are intended for soviet television viewers and are our internal affair on the other hand we have no technical means of preventing them from reaching other countries particularly as regards the international use of the signal only discussion and settlement of the problem at world level will provide a solution on july the federal court put a number of questions to the parties about the factual and legal position the head office of the ptt replied on august and the applicant company on august on june the rapporteur informed autronic ag that the federal court had not yet been able to consider the appeal and that the company had until august to submit any further observations on june the radio and television division sent the telecommunications authorities the following telex in connection with the judgment of a request we would like to know on which conditions reception of tv programmes via telecommunications satellites is permitted in the please let us also know if the soviet communications satellite g-horizont stationar is received in your country by cable operators the authorities replied on july as follows the conditions for reception of tv programmes by cable operators in the seem to be quite similar to those in your country the netherlands ptt issues licences to cable operators separate for each particular tv program with such a licence the operator can install his own tvro antenna although it is advisable for him to consult with ptt for frequency co-ordination purposes in order to avoid interference from terrestrial microwaves a few years ago some reception of the g-horizont satellite did indeed take place this was considered illegal because of the absence of agreements with the program provider and satellite operator and the cable operators were so informed in response to a similar request for information the finnish telecommunications authorities stated the following on july we have permission from the telecommunications ministry of ussr to receive as an experiment the g-horizont signal up to authorization for distribution has been given in seven cases so far the federal court gave judgment on july and served the text on autronic ag on november the court held that the appellant company was seeking a review in the abstract of the legal position whereas in reality it could only complain of the ban on receiving the disputed broadcasts during the fera exhibition there was however no point in ruling on the admissibility of the appeal since at all events the company had failed to show that it had an interest worthy of protection apart from g-horizont there was no other satellite over europe at the time whose broadcasts were receivable by means of a domestic dish aerial autronic ag picked up the signals from the soviet satellite because there was no alternative source as long as this situation continued there would be practically no market for such equipment and only eccentrics sonderlinge would be inclined to buy it although two other satellites one german and one french were to be launched it remained unclear how they would be used and it was impossible to assess either the interest that direct reception of their broadcasts would arouse or the number of dish aerials that would come into use the federal court concluded that as it had failed to adduce evidence of any direct economic interest the applicant company had no interest worthy of protection it therefore refused to determine the merits of the case at the present time there are still only a handful of direct-broadcasting satellites whereas there are more than telecommunications satellites such as g-horizont covering all or part of western europe and broadcasting all kinds of uncoded programmes intended for the general public article of the federal constitution guarantees inviolability of the secrecy of letters and telegrams the relevant provisions of the federal act of october regulating telegraph and telephone communications are as follows section the post and telecommunications authority shall have the exclusive right to set up and operate transmitting and receiving equipment or equipment of any kind for the electric or radio transmission of signals images or sounds section the competent authority shall be able to issue licences for setting up and operating equipment for the electric and radio transmission of signals images and sounds section the provisions required for the implementation of this act shall be incorporated into the ordinance on telegraphs and telephones to be enacted by the federal council and in the detailed regulations on december the federal council enacted ordinance no relating to the act among other things the council laid down the scope of television licences article licence i for television-receiving equipment shall entitle the holder to operate equipment for the private reception by means of radio waves or by electric wire of swiss and foreign public television broadcasts reception of television broadcasts on premises which are not accessible to the public shall be deemed to be private the licence-holder may himself install his equipment for receiving broadcasts by means of radio waves a special licence must be held in order to exercise rights vested in the state other than those mentioned in paragraphs and in particular in order to demonstrate how receiving equipment works to install receiving equipment in the homes of third parties and to arrange for public reception of broadcasts the revised text of ordinance no which was enacted on august came into force on january although it does not apply in the instant case several of its provisions are worth quoting article licences may be refused where there is good reason to suppose that the telecommunications equipment will be used for a purpose that is article radio- and television-receiving licences shall authorise their holders to receive swiss and foreign radio broadcasts privately or publicly article a community-antenna licence shall entitle the holder to article the authorisation referred to in article f shall be granted where the appropriate telecommunications authority has given its consent and none of the grounds for refusal provided for in article exist on december the federal council submitted to parliament by means of a communication a draft decree of general application on satellite broadcasting the decree enacted on december and effective from may contained an article concerning foreign programmes which was worded as follows a licence from the appropriate federal department shall be required in order to retransmit programmes broadcast by satellite under a foreign licence such a licence shall be granted where this is not contrary to the country s higher interests and where the department may refuse to grant a licence where a state whose licensing system allows a programme does not accept the retransmission on its territory of programmes broadcast under a swiss licence the international telecommunication convention which was concluded in within the international telecommunication union and has been revised several times came into force on january and has been ratified by all the council of europe s member states in it has been published in full in the official collection of federal statutes p. and p. and in the compendium of federal law article entitled secrecy of telecommunications provides members agree to take all possible measures compatible with the system of telecommunication used with a view to ensuring the secrecy of international correspondence nevertheless they reserve the right to communicate such correspondence to the competent authorities in order to ensure the application of their internal laws or the execution of international conventions to which they are parties under article member states are bound to abide by the convention and the administrative regulations in all telecommunications offices and stations established or operated by them which engage in international services or which are capable of causing harmful interference with radio services of other countries the convention is complemented by three sets of detailed administrative rules as indicated in article the radio regulations the telegraph regulations and the telephone regulations only the radio regulations are relevant in the instant case the radio regulations date from december and were likewise amended in and also on other occasions they run to over a thousand pages and except for numbers and have not been published in the official collection of federal statutes the latter contains the following reference to them the administrative regulations relating to the international telecommunication convention of october are not being published in the official collection of federal statutes they may be consulted at the head office of the ptt library and documentation viktoriastrasse berne or may be obtained from the itu international telecommunication union place des nations the following provisions are the ones relevant in the present case number fixed-satellite service a radiocommunication service between earth stations at specified fixed points when one or more satellites are used in some cases this service includes satellite-to-satellite links which may also be effected in the inter-satellite service the fixed-satellite service may also include feeder links for other space radiocommunication services number broadcasting-satellite service a radiocommunication service in which signals transmitted or retransmitted by space stations are intended for direct reception by the general public in the broadcasting-satellite service the term ‘ direct reception shall encompass both individual reception and community reception number any administration may assign a frequency in a band allocated to the fixed service or allocated to the fixed-satellite service to a station authorized to transmit unilaterally from one specified fixed point to one or more specified fixed points provided that such transmissions are not intended to be received directly by the general public numbers in the application of the appropriate provisions of the convention administrations bind themselves to take the necessary measures to prohibit and prevent on september the permanent mission of switzerland to the international organisations in put two questions to the international telecommunication union which replied on october saying inter alia with regard to this aspect of the practical pursuance of the principle of secrecy of telecommunications it is important indeed essential to note also that no precise measures concerning practical ways of effectively ensuring such ‘ secrecy of telecommunications are prescribed by either the convention or the rr radio regulations but that the rr leave the choice of these practical measures to the administrations of the union s members that is how it is necessary to understand and interpret numbers and of the rr which stipulate that it is administrations that bind themselves to take the necessary measures to prohibit and prevent a the unauthorised interception of radiocommunications not intended for the general use of the public that also applies of course to number of the rr this means that it is for the administration of each of the union s members itself to take whatever measures it deems necessary to prohibit and prevent on its territory the unauthorised interception of the radiocommunications referred to in number of the rr this incidentally is in accordance with the first principle laid down in the preamble to the convention which is worded as follows while fully recognising the sovereign right of each country to regulate its telecommunication in the case under consideration here it is for the swiss administration to put into effect switzerland s undertaking to ensure the secrecy of telecommunications by whatever measures it itself considers necessary for the purpose such measures may of course be different from those regarded as necessary by the administrations of other members of the union which have given the same undertaking with regard lastly to the authorisation required for the interception of radiocommunications not intended for the general use of the public it should be inferred from the terms of numbers and of the rr that an administration which has committed itself to taking the necessary measures to prohibit and prevent such unauthorised interception in order to ensure the secrecy of telecommunications is also to be regarded as the one empowered to give where appropriate the authorisation for such interception on its territory and hence to lay down the terms and conditions on which it grants such authorisation in the case under consideration here it is therefore the swiss administration that with a view to ensuring the secrecy of telecommunications should decide whether or not such authorisation is to be granted and lay down the terms and conditions it itself considers necessary for the purposes of that decision by way of a conclusion and a final legal consequence it should be borne in mind that what was stated in the preceding paragraph also applies mutatis mutandis in respect of the authorisation itself at a session held in from to june the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations adopted recommendation which reads the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations considering recommends the european convention on transfrontier television which was drawn up within the council of europe and signed on may by nine states including is not yet in force article entitled freedom of reception and of retransmission provides the parties shall ensure freedom of expression and information in accordance with article art of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and they shall guarantee freedom of reception and shall not restrict the retransmission on their territories of programme services which comply with the terms of this convention the swiss government made a declaration to the effect that the confederation would apply the convention provisionally in accordance with article autronic ag applied to the commission on january application no the company complained that the granting of permission to receive uncoded television broadcasts for general use from a telecommunications satellite had been made subject to the consent of the broadcasting state and it alleged an infringement of its right to receive information as guaranteed in article art of the convention the commission declared the application admissible on december in its report of march made under article art the commission expressed the opinion by eleven votes to two with one abstention that there had been a breach of article art the full text of the commission s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment at the hearing the government confirmed their submissions in their memorial they requested the court to hold that article art of the convention is not applicable to the case at issue in the alternative that since by the terms of article third sentence art of the convention even broadcasting enterprises may be subject to licensing both to receive and to retransmit television broadcasts sent via a telecommunications satellite there is all the more reason why a private commercial enterprise should be required to apply for a receiving licence in a given case in the further alternative that the state interference relating to this licensing system was prescribed by law including international law and was necessary in a democratic society for the purpose of maintaining international order in telecommunications and to prevent the disclosure of confidential information transmitted by a telecommunications satellite from one fixed point to another,case referred court

the case originated in an application no against the russian federation lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a russian national mr askerbiy shabanovich milinov the applicant on august the applicant was represented by mr v. gaydash a lawyer practising in krasnodar the russian government the government were represented by mr g. matyushkin the representative of the russian federation to the european court of human rights and then by his successor in that office mr m. galperin the applicant alleged in particular violations of the right to freedom of expression and the right to liberty on march notice of the application was given to the government the applicant was born in at the material time he lived in maykop in the republic of adygeya on the morning of september a meeting митинг was organised in the main square in maykop to celebrate the anniversary of the peaceful unification of adygeya with russia at a.m. the applicant entered the square holding a placard that read why were my magnificent noble people exterminated and expelled « за что истребили и выгнали мой прекрасный благородный народ » to express his disagreement with the official interpretation of historic events in his view the unification with russia had not been voluntary for the people of adygeya almost immediately he was approached by a man in police uniform and a man in plain clothes the latter introduced himself as an officer of the federal security service the fsb and demanded that the applicant leave the meeting the applicant asked why such a demand was being made and the fsb officer pulled the placard out of his hands and grabbed his right hand in the meantime the uniformed police officer had forced the applicant s left hand behind his back the two officers then dragged the applicant to a police minivan parked nearby where a larger group of police officers stood the applicant felt pain in his right shoulder and screamed once they had got close to the minivan the police officers took note of the details of the applicant s identity document one of the officers g. escorted the applicant to his parked car and ordered him to leave at about p.m. the applicant arrived home and saw g. and another police officer n. outside his house g. demanded that the applicant get in the police car in order to go to the police station housing the department of the interior of the town of maykop the police station because the head of the police station wanted to have a preventive conversation « профилактическая беседа » with him the applicant obeyed as he feared that otherwise the police officers would use force on the way to the police station the police car made a stop at a medical analysis laboratory where the applicant underwent an alcohol concentration test which showed that he was not inebriated at p.m. g. escorted the applicant into the police station placed him in a room designated as a place where officers could study while they were on duty the study room and told him to wait to be called for an interview with the head of the police station having waited for about an hour the applicant decided to leave the police station he approached an officer on duty sh. and asked him why he was being detained without any record having been made sh made a phone call to his superiors informed the applicant that he had not received permission to release him and told him to return to the study room the applicant could not leave the police station without sh. s permission because the latter had his identity document and the entry was guarded by an armed police officer after two more hours had passed the applicant again asked sh if he could leave sh made another phone call and said that he had not received permission to release the applicant at some point the applicant s daughter arrived at the police station she complained verbally that her father was being arbitrarily detained at p.m. sh received permission from his superiors to let the applicant go he returned the applicant s identity document to him and told the armed police officer to allow the applicant and his daughter to pass later that day the applicant visited a traumatology centre where a duty doctor recorded his complaints of pain in the right shoulder the applicant was diagnosed with a muscle strain in the right shoulder and prescribed treatment on october the applicant asked the forensic medical expert bureau of the republic of adygeya to give a medical expert opinion on the nature of his shoulder injury an expert report issued on december confirmed the diagnosis of a muscle strain and noted that it had most probably been caused by an unusual and abnormal movement of the shoulder blade the applicant complained to the maykop investigation department of the prosecutor s office of his illtreatment by the police and unlawful arrest on september on november a senior investigator of the investigation department refused to open a criminal case having found no prima facie case of ill-treatment in particular the investigator noted that the applicant had not been subject to administrative arrest or found guilty of an administrative offence and had only been taken to the police station because he had scared children with his placard and his appearance the applicant appealed against the decision of november to the head of the investigation department who upheld it on february the applicant brought civil claims against the ministry of the interior of the republic of adygeya the fsb department of the republic of adygeya and the ministry of finance of the russian federation seeking compensation for the non-pecuniary damage caused to him by the actions of the police and fsb officers on september the ill-treatment unlawful detention and interference with his freedom of expression on january the maykop town court the town court dismissed the claims having reasoned in so far as relevant as follows as the court has established the president s office and the committee of ministers of the republic of adygeya scheduled a meeting for a.m. on september to celebrate the anniversary of the voluntary unification of adygeya with russia there was a short delay before the meeting on september the claimant arrived at the square early having brought a placard which stated ‘ why were my magnificent noble people exterminated and expelled at the same time he chose to stand in a place where there were children the claimant had not informed the organisers of the meeting of the above-mentioned action his action did not correspond to the aim of the public event given the existing historic traditions and the practice of celebrating holidays and memorial dates and taking into account their important social and political character the law of the republic of adygeya set specific holidays and memorial dates in the adygeya republic one of those dates is may the day of remembrance and sorrow for victims of the caucasus war in the century on may mr milinov s actions might have been acceptable moreover the claimant dressed in dark clothes was near small children from performing arts groups he held the placard protesting against the event which a large group of people leaders of the republic of adygeya and many guests from other regions of the russian federation had gathered together to celebrate therefore the claimant s behaviour could not but attract attention from representatives of state agencies entrusted with maintaining public order at the meeting as mr milinov has explained himself he expected a similar reaction having approached the claimant from behind police officers addressed him which provoked an inappropriate reaction on his part as the claimant explained at the court hearing he rudely asked the police officers what they wanted and whether it was the time of yezhov and beria again the claimant was asked to hand over the placard he ignored the request and the placard was taken from him by force the claimant was agitated and he was surrounded by small children and their parents who in turn started expressing their disapproval of his behaviour the claimant was invited to step aside to give explanations however he ignored that request from the police officers mr milinov s actions including his rude refusal to exit the crowd of children in response to a request from the police officers therefore called for lawful and wellfounded actions by the police officers in particular his removal from the crowd so that he could be identified and explanations could be sought as regards the slogan on his placard the claimant s argument that he was unlawfully detained is unsubstantiated and does not correspond to reality as he absolutely agreed to go to the police station voluntarily he was not coerced into doing this by anyone the police officers on duty at the police station merely announced to the claimant who approached them on a number of occasions that the head of the police station had asked him to wait for him had he wished to do so the claimant could have left the police station at any time during those three hours and forty minutes mentioned by him as he ultimately did he remained in the study room at the police station and not in a cell for those subject to administrative arrest and on a number of occasions he freely went out into the police station s courtyard to smoke in such circumstances mr milinov s claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage should be dismissed in view of its manifestly ill-founded character. on february the supreme court of the republic of adygeya the supreme court upheld the judgment of january on appeal having fully endorsed the town court s reasoning in particular the supreme court supported the town court s finding that the police officers had correctly responded to the applicant s refusal to exit the crowd of children by removing him from the crowd to check his identity and that the applicant had failed to provide any evidence in support of his claim that the officers actions had been unlawful the supreme court also held that the time the applicant had spent at the police station three and a half hours did not amount to deprivation of liberty as the applicant had voluntarily followed the police officers to the station had remained in the study room and not in a cell had freely moved around the police station had left the police station to go into the courtyard to smoke had used a mobile phone and had freely left the police station article of the constitution of the russian federation guarantees freedom of thought and expression freedom to receive and impart information and freedom of the mass media

the case originated in an application no against the republic of malta lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a maltese national mr michael falzon the applicant on july the applicant was represented by dr t. comodini cachia a lawyer practising in valletta the maltese government the government were represented by their agent dr p. grech attorney general the applicant alleged a breach of article as a result of the domestic courts judgments fining him for defamation on august the complaint concerning article was communicated to the government and the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible pursuant to rule of the rules of court the applicant was born in and lives in naxxar the applicant served as a member of parliament between and and he served as a government minister between and even before he was elected to parliament he had already established himself as a political commentator in the media and regularly authored opinions related to national politics which were published in national newspapers upon his retirement from parliament the applicant began writing weekly opinion columns in the newspaper maltatoday and another weekly paper on may dr michael falzon referred to hereinafter as m.f. for ease of reference as he has the exact same name as the applicant the deputy leader of the malta labour party mlp delivered a speech in public which was reported on the national media during the speech he informed the public that he had received an anonymous email and threatening letters in respect of which he had complained directly to the commissioner of police cop he furthermore referred to the discussion he had had with the latter during which he had asked him to investigate the issue the most relevant parts of the speech read as follows translation done by the registry but the fact that today one opens the newspaper illum front page and reads the editorial by s.b. who chose to speak about a pending police investigation about an anonymous email that i received and about a threatening letter that i received this is a level which should not be acceptable in our country and whoever is behind these stories wherever he might be and let me be clear wherever he might be he should be ashamed ashamed yes i received an anonymous email and i received threatening letters last november i did not disclose this to my family today they were told by maltatoday i can tell them myself but when something illegal occurs i go to the police and that s what i did and i went to the cop since people who put forward such stories can disclose them i can also do so now for everyone to know so i went to the cop i will tell you what i told him and he will confirm it he told me ‘ what will we do mike if it were to turn out to be x or y i told him ‘ i am telling you as of now mr r. be it whosoever in this country i am authorising you as from now in advance even before you start the investigation to proceed because what is illegal i condemn it and we as a party always condemned illegality and we come to the subject of the anonymous email u wasalna fuq email anonima and today k.s.n a journalist this person phoned me yesterday as well told me ‘ but you know this is an innocuous email it contains nothing. and i tell k.s.n and other purveyors of this type of journalism that when they saw that there is a police investigation is it you you decide what is illegal and what is not because he was an admirer and the sender of this email true i will speak to him of course but note that he sent it anonymously generally admirers tell you ‘ hi mike is everything alright they do not write anonymously and k.s.n said other things as well and so did s.b the editor of maltatoday among other things he said because he knows a lot he also phoned me yesterday and i told him i told him ‘ you are breaking the law it is now up to the police he also said that apparently apparently from the investigation into the email conducted by the police nothing had emerged and that it will stop there and i will tell him now in public ‘ mr k.s.n and mr s.b. you have not discovered america words to that effect have been said by an employee of our party for weeks at the centre for weeks and he told me that i will make a fool of myself i will not interfere i will not interfere with the police investigation that is for them to see but yesterday i told the cop and inspector c. that such discourse had long been doing the rounds at the centre party club i gave them the names and it is now up to the police to decide whether to find out where this information originated from and who is deciding matters in this country. on the same day k.s.n. a journalist published an article in the newspaper illum entitled email sent to m.f brings admirer before the police the article started off by stating that an innocent email sent to the deputy leader of the mlp had been passed on to the police who in turn had identified the sender and subsequently questioned him it concluded with the statement that when m.f was asked about him reporting the matter to the police the deputy leader of the mlp that is to say m.f replied that he would not confirm nor deny that he was aware of the case on may maltatoday published an opinion by the applicant entitled policing one s enemies prompted by the above-mentioned speech in which the applicant queried the manner in which the two main political parties perceived the police force the article s opening paragraphs read as follows during a recent short visit to london i had the opportunity to watch the film ‘ the lives of others original title das leben anderen sic an academy awardwinning german movie set in the cultural scene of east berlin monitored by secret agents of the stasi the secret police of the former german democratic republic east germany the film puts the methods of the stasi at the centre of the plot and as a result clearly exposes their repulsive behaviour the police force i believe is simply responsible for making sure that people obey the law for protecting people and property and for arresting criminals using the police in a different context and for the purpose of controlling people s freedoms is the basic notion of the typical police state even if you insert the word ‘ democratic in your country s official title for me the biggest unease was caused by the realisation that the film was set in a period that is only some twenty-two years ago which in malta corresponds to the mintoff former labour party leader and prime minister years when i was already active in politics little did i think that events that were to unfold when i was back in my country would make me wonder whether the pn nationalist party and the mlp look at the duties of the police in somewhat different manner. other relevant parts of the article read as follows i say this with deep regret but i can only be seriously perturbed by the ease with which mlp deputy leader michael falzon m.f persuaded the commissioner of police to investigate the source of a trivial and unimportant anonymous e-mail that he had received more so when this e-mail could only have been misguidedly considered ‘ suspicious and even then in an absolutely far-fetched way in the context of the infighting and internal feuds within the mlp according to what dr. michael falzon m.f said the police commissioner who apparently is on familiar first name speaking terms with dr. falzon m.f asked whether he would proceed in the same fashion whether the culprit eventually proved to be x or y implying that the commissioner was offering to act in a discriminatory way according who the ‘ guilty person was matters are even more worrying because when the police successfully traced the original writer and dispatcher of the e-mail they impounded his computer and obliged him to go and sign daily at the police headquarters even though he was not accused of any crime has not mlp deputy leader michael falzon m.f successfully used the police force to control the freedom of an innocent law-abiding private citizen whom he suspected could be a political enemy and has not somebody in the police force abused of his powers by condescending to do this for the advantage of the faction led by michael falzon m.f in the mlp s internal squabbles why should the police force interfere in labour s internal politics where it is obvious there are too many cooks spoiling the broth yet the ease with which the mlp deputy leader phones him up to complain and even worse the ease with which this leading politician is provided with a service that can not be linked in any way with the pursuit of ‘ criminality as we know it makes one wonder. these events seem to indicate that within labour there are people who can influence and interfere in decisions taken by the police force this is happening when they are still in opposition asking what would happen in this area once they are in government is therefore a legitimate question. so what is the government doing about this does the mlp deputy leader who happens to be my namesake carry more weight and influence with the commissioner of police than the deputy prime minister who is politically responsible for the police force i firmly believe that tonio borg then minister of interior should set up a high powered inquiry with the specific task of getting to the bottom of this sordid soap opera he owes it to those who dedicated the best years of their life to ensure the personal freedom of each and every citizen of malta he owes it to all present and future maltese citizens who did not live the past so that they will live in a future where no one controls their freedom and hence their lives. on july m.f. the deputy leader of the mlp instituted libel proceedings against the applicant and against the editor of the newspaper under article of chapter of the laws of malta see the relevant domestic law section below and sought damages claiming that the abovementioned extracts of the article had been defamatory by way of defence the applicant claimed that a the published article had contained his opinion and had consequently constituted a fair comment and the expression of a value judgment b any facts had been substantially correct and based on what had been declared publicly by m.f himself a few days prior to the impugned publication and c the claimant was a person occupying a public office and was consequently bound to accept a wider level of criticism during the proceedings the court of magistrates heard the testimony of the plaintiff m.f the cop the applicant the editor s.b and two other journalists a.b.d and k.s.n. it saw documentation submitted consisting of an email exchange between the mlp deputy leader and a third person j.b. as well as the transcript of the deputy leader s speech and copies of two articles both entitled email sent to deputy leader brings an admirer before the police one having been published online and one in print the cop testified as follows as summarised by the firstinstance court he denied that m.f had persuaded him or influenced him in respect of his doing his job in connection with the case at issue m.f had requested and obtained a normal appointment with the cop when they met m.f had showed him a letter which the cop considered to be injurious and full of threats towards m.f the latter requested the cop to investigate the contents of the letter m.f also informed the cop that he had received an email which was later passed on to the cop following an invitation to do so by the same cop the cop asked m.f whether he intended to initiate proceedings against the person who should result to be responsible given that the prosecution of such a crime would require the injured party to lodge a complaint the documents which had been passed on to the cop had in turn been passed on to the criminal investigation department c.i.d for further investigation and the cop had had no further contact with m.f concerning the case which had not been given any particular priority on his part the applicant failed to make written submissions within the stipulated timeframe and his late submissions were not accepted by the court that proceeded to judgment by a judgment of may the court of magistrates found the applicant guilty of having defamed the deputy leader of the mlp and was ordered to pay him euros eur in damages costs were also to be paid jointly by the applicant and the editor who was also ordered to pay eur in damages the court referred to the cop s witness testimony to explain the factual situation in its view while noting that public figures such as politicians were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism they were nevertheless protected under article their protection having to be weighed in relation to the interests of the open discussion of political issues the court considered the article defamatory as it had tarnished and impinged on the claimant s reputation it rejected the applicant s defence noting that it had not been proved that i m.f had manipulated the cop due to the political office that he held in the party in which he militates ii that with his actions m.f had offended the police force since he used the police force for his personal aims iii that m.f was some deus ex machina who pulls the strings of the police force from behind the scene to reach his goals the applicant appealed by a judgment of october the court of appeal in its inferior jurisdiction rejected the appeal and confirmed the firstinstance judgment it considered it appropriate to analyse and mention all the relevant evidence that had not been referred to by the firstinstance court m.f. as plaintiff and now respondent submitted that the reader had been induced to believe that he had persuaded the police to harm someone when all he had done was to file a report requesting that the anonymous letters and emails he had received be investigated the court also referred to the statements made by the cop see above the applicant appellant before the court of appeal explained that in his view the email received by m.f had been innocuous and that m.f had thus reacted disproportionality according to the applicant from the speech delivered by m.f publicly at the labour centre in rabat it transpired that there was a certain familiarity between him and the cop indeed if that had not been so m.f would have reported the incident at a police station like an ordinary citizen and not with the cop in his view it was natural to question whether m.f had used the cop in connection with the internal affairs of the party even when cross-examined he reiterated that influence had been exerted by m.f on the cop the editor testified that in his opinion the speech delivered by the deputy leader of the mlp indicated that the latter had put pressure on the cop to investigate the matter when he had met up with him to discuss the emails and the anonymous letters in reply to a question while being cross-examined as to whether m.f had put pressure on the cop k.s.n replied that he was aware that a report had been filed concerning the email and that on the same day of publication m.f had declared that he was authorising the cop to institute proceedings against whomever turned out to be the culprit the court of appeal was of the view that having examined all the relevant evidence and thus gaining an understanding of the circumstances preceding and surrounding the article the applicant s assumption could not be considered as constituting fair comment in the eyes of the ordinary reader the comments and criticism made by the applicant could not be considered as objectively reasonable made in good faith and balanced given that they were based on a certain assumption that m.f had exercised influence over the cop with the aim of controlling people s freedom the attack on m.f had thus exceeded the limits of just criticism m.f had had every right to file a report and the fact that he was politically active had not justified such an attack which had not been corroborated by factual evidence it considered that even though the manifestation of free expression was an established principle that freedom was to be exercised within those just limits of the canon of objective veracity of facts and restraint entro l-limiti ġusti ta dak ilkanoni tal-verita oġġettiva tal-fatti u tal-kontinenza as elaborated by the most progressive doctrine and jurisprudence on topical issues and the exercise of criticism on march the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings complaining that he had suffered inter alia a breach of article of the convention as a result of the judgments in the libel proceedings he argued in substance that his opinion piece had consisted of criticism which was a legitimate manner of expressing an opinion about the work of a public figure and was allowed in a democratic society noting that the extensive protection given to such a public figure served to silence free expression he further claimed that the ordinary courts had referred to insinuations and allegations which had not been made or implied by the applicant in his article such as the statement by the court of magistrates to the effect that m.f had manipulated the cop or that the latter had been subjected to pressure which had impeded the exercise of his function as well that m.f was a deus ex macchina pulling the strings of the police force the applicant emphasised that these were gratuitous inventions by the ordinary court which had not been mentioned in the article by a judgment of march the civil court first hall in its constitutional competence dismissed the applicant s claims it considered that the applicant was attempting to obtain a revision of the ordinary proceedings and noted that it was not quite true that the applicant had never implied that m.f had manipulated the cop indeed his article had precisely questioned has not the mlp deputy leader mf successfully used the police force to control the freedom of an innocent lawabiding private citizen whom he suspected could be a political enemy in any event even if the applicant considered the statements made by the court of magistrates in its reasoning to be invented this had not constituted a breach of his article rights the court noted the reference to the stasi with which the applicant had started his article and his narrative of m.f. s actions which had resulted in an individual being investigated and subsequently having his computer seized in that context he had asked whether m.f had used the police against a political opponent the applicant criticised the cop for following up on the indications given by m.f. to the extent that the applicant had called on the minister of the interior to look into the matter indeed the cop was also an object of the applicant s criticism according to the court the word uses did not mean manipulate as implied by the court of magistrates but within the context of the article at issue it nevertheless implied an element of abuse the criticism against m.f was that he had taken advantage of his political position to put pressure on the police in order that the latter would take action in persecuting an innocent citizen the court considered that it was legitimate for a victim of a crime to complain to the police and then it was for the police to act on the matter further the initial reference to the stasi in the opening of the article had been regrettable even if it was not intended to do so it had given the impression of a comparison being made in its view even accepting that a public person was subject to greater limits of acceptable criticism given the article at issue the ordinary courts had not failed to strike a fair balance between the competing rights the applicant appealed by a judgment of january the constitutional court dismissed his appeal it noted that the ordinary court judgments and the penalty inflicted constituted an interference with the applicant s rights under article which had been prescribed by law article of the press act it emphasised the importance of free expression for the press nevertheless it noted that the press could not exceed certain limits and had to exercise its function in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities particularly as regards the reputation and rights of others acknowledging that politicians were subject to wider limits of acceptable criticism it nevertheless noted that they remained holders of their right to the protection of their reputation the quest for reasonableness and proportionality in such circumstances had to be seen against the background of the importance of public debate noting the difference between facts and value judgments the latter not being subject to the need for proof it considered that a person could not hide behind an opinion or value judgment to impute untrue facts in respect of other persons it considered that the court of appeal had reached a legitimate conclusion in finding that the applicant s opinion piece had contained declarations which assumed as a fact that the mlp deputy leader had illegitimately and abusively influenced the police and also that the exercise of illegitimate and abusive pressure on the cop had not been proved as a fact the constitutional court noted that while the article had contained a series of questions in respect of which the applicant argued that it was for the reader to answer it had also contained assertions some of which had not reflected the real facts according to the court of appeal further the constitutional court considered that just because an alleged fact was given the form of a question this did not entail that it was no longer a factual assertion but rather became a value judgment even the way in which the question was posed namely has not m.f clearly included a factual affirmation and clearly invited a positive reply similarly the quest does the mlp deputy leader who happens to be my namesake carry more weight and influence with the commissioner of police than the deputy prime minister who is politically responsible for the police force was nothing but an allegation of fact in the form of a question lastly the constitutional court noted that the amount of the fine had not been particularly severe so much so that the quantum had not been appealed there was therefore no violation of article section of the press act in so far as relevant states that a press offence is committed by means of the publication or distribution in malta of printed matter under section of the same act whosoever by such means libels any person shall be liable to a fine upon conviction section of the act reads as follows in the case of defamation by any means mentioned in article the object of which is to take away or injure the reputation of any person the competent civil court may in addition to the damages which may be due under any law for the time being in force in respect of any actual loss or injury grant to the person libelled a sum not exceeding eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents in any case to which this article applies the defendant may in mitigation of damages prove that he made or offered to make an apology to the plaintiff for such defamation before the commencement of the action for damages or as soon afterwards as he had an opportunity of doing so in case the action shall have been commenced before there was an opportunity of making or offering such apology provided that the defendant

concluded that from to the second applicant had been an employee of the lithuanian branch of the kgb that he had the status of a former kgb officer and that he was thereby subject to the restrictions provided under section of the kgb act on may the second applicant was dismissed from his job at the office of the prosecutor general on the basis of that conclusion the second applicant brought an administrative action against the security intelligence authorities and the office of the prosecutor general he claimed that from to he had merely studied at a special kgb school in moscow and that from to he had worked in the kgb as an informer for the lithuanian security intelligence authorities and should therefore be entitled to benefit from the exceptions under section of the kgb act he claimed that his dismissal under the act and his resultant inability to find employment were unlawful on august the allowed the second applicant s claim quashed the conclusion of may and ordered him to be reinstated the court found that the period of the second applicant s studies at the kgb school from to was not to be taken into account for the purposes of the kgb act that he had worked in the kgb for a period of five months in that he had not occupied a kgb position dealing with political investigations and that in any event he had been a secret informer for the lithuanian authorities the court concluded that the exceptions under section of the kgb act applied to the second applicant and that his dismissal had therefore been unlawful following an appeal by the security intelligence authorities on october the court of appeal quashed the judgment of august it held that although the first-instance court had properly found that the second applicant had worked at the kgb for only five months it had not been established that he had worked there as a secret informer for the lithuanian authorities accordingly he could not benefit from the exceptions under section of the kgb act the second applicant appealed against the court of appeal s judgment by a decision of january the president of the supreme court allowed the appeal however by a final decision of april the full

kgb act was enacted on july by the seimas the lithuanian parliament and promulgated by the president of the republic the kgb act reads as follows section recognition of the security committee as a criminal organisation the ussr state security committee nkvd nkgb mgb kgb hereinafter ‘ the ssc is recognised as a criminal organisation which was responsible for war crimes genocide repression terror and political persecution in the when occupied by the section restrictions on the present activities of permanent employees of the ssc for a period of ten years from the date of entry into force of this act former employees of the ssc may not work as public officials or civil servants in government local or defence authorities the state security department the police the prosecution courts or diplomatic service customs state supervisory bodies and other authorities monitoring public institutions as lawyers or notaries as employees of banks and other credit institutions on strategic economic projects in security companies structures in other companies structures providing detective services in communications systems or in the educational system as teachers educators or heads of institutions nor may they perform a job requiring the carrying of a weapon. section cases in which the restrictions shall not be applied the restrictions provided for in section shall not be applied to former permanent employees of the ssc who while working at the ssc investigated only criminal cases and who discontinued their work at the ssc not later than march the centre for research into the genocide and resistance of the lithuanian people and the state security department may recommend by a reasoned application that no restrictions under this law be applied to former permanent employees of the ssc who within three months of the date of the entry into force of this law report to the state security department and disclose all information in their possession about their former work at the ssc and their current relations with former ssc employees and agents a decision in this respect shall be taken by a commission of three persons set up by the president of the republic no employees of the centre for research into the genocide and resistance of the lithuanian people or the state security department may be appointed to the commission the commission s rules shall be confirmed by the president of the republic. section procedure for implementation of the act the procedure for implementation of the act shall be governed by a special law section entry into force of the act this act shall come into force on january following the examination by the constitutional court of the compatibility of the kgb act with the constitution see paragraph below on may section of the kgb act was amended to the effect that even those individuals who had worked for the kgb after march could be eligible for the exceptions under section of that act on july a separate law on the implementation of the kgb act was enacted under that law the centre for research into the genocide and resistance of the lithuanian people and the state security department were empowered to reach a conclusion on an individual s status as a former permanent employee of the kgb former kgb officer for the purposes of the kgb act on january the government adopted a list the list of positions in various branches of the kgb on lithuanian territory attesting to a person s status as a former kgb officer for the purposes of the kgb act a total of different positions were listed in this respect on march the examined the issue of the kgb act s compatibility with the constitution the constitutional court held in particular that the kgb act had been passed in order to carry out security screening measures on former kgb officers who were deemed to be lacking in loyalty to the lithuanian state the decided that the prohibition on former kgb officers occupying public posts was compatible with the constitution it further ruled that the statutory ban on the holding by former kgb officers of jobs in various branches of the private sector was compatible with the constitutional principle of a free choice of profession in that the state was entitled to lay down specific requirements for persons applying for work in the most important economic sectors in order to ensure the protection of national security and proper functioning of the educational and financial systems the also held that the restrictions under the kgb act did not amount to a criminal charge against former kgb officers while the kgb act does not specifically guarantee a right of access to a court to contest the security intelligence authorities conclusion it was recognised by the domestic courts that as a matter of practice a dismissal from employment in the public service on the basis of that conclusion gave rise to an administrative court action and a further appeal under the general procedure governing industrial disputes and alleged breaches of personal rights by the public authorities under articles and of the code of administrative procedure article of the civil code and article of the code of civil procedure as in force at the material time restrictions have been imposed in many post-communist countries with a view to screening the employment of former security agents or active collaborators in the former regimes in this connection international human rights bodies have at times found fault with such legislation where it has lacked precision or proportionality and have characterised it as discrimination in employment or the exercise of a profession on the basis of political opinion see below the possibility of appealing to the courts has been considered a significant safeguard although not sufficient in itself to rectify shortcomings in the legislation article of the european social charter provides with a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to work the parties undertake to protect effectively the right of the worker to earn his living in an occupation freely entered upon this provision retained word for word in the revised charter of which came into force with regard to lithuania on august has been consistently interpreted by the european committee of social rights ecsr as establishing a right not to be discriminated against in employment the non-discrimination guarantee is stipulated in article e of the revised charter in the following terms the enjoyment of the rights set forth in this charter shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national extraction or social origin health association with a national minority birth or other status. the question of the dismissal of public servants on account of their activities under totalitarian regimes has been addressed in the light of these provisions at least as regards germany in its most recent examination of germany s compliance with article of the charter published in november the ecsr took note of the provisions of the reunification treaty that allow for the dismissal of public servants on the basis of their activities on behalf of the security services of the german democratic republic it concluded that was not complying with its obligations this was expanded upon in the following terms the committee observes that there is no precise definition of the functions from which individuals can be excluded either in the form of a refusal to recruit or a dismissal on the grounds of previous political activities or activities within the former gdr institutions competent in security matters the committee has examined the conformity of these provisions in the light of article of the charter under this provision restriction of a right enshrined in the charter is permitted if it is prescribed by law is necessary in a democratic society and serves one of the purposes listed in the article whilst recognising that the provisions were prescribed by law within the meaning of article and served one of the purposes listed therein namely the protection of national security the committee considered that they were not necessary within the meaning of article in that they did not apply solely to services which had responsibilities in the fields of law and order and national security or to functions involving such responsibilities. the ecsr adopted its conclusions in regard to lithuania s implementation of the revised charter on may they will be made public at a later date the international labour organisation ilo has also adopted a number of relevant international legal instruments the most pertinent text is ilo convention no on discrimination employment and occupation of in its general survey the committee of experts on the application of conventions and recommendations ceacr restated its interpretation of convention no drawing upon examples taken from national law regarding the ceacr s position was the following the committee does not accept the argument that in cases in which persons had been accused of having carried out political activities in the former german democratic republic the more the person had by the assumption of certain functions identified himself or herself with that unjust regime the more incriminated he or she was and the less reasonable it was that this person hold a position in the current administration. more recently however the ceacr has expressed satisfaction with the german courts observance of the principle of proportionality in cases where civil servants challenge their dismissal see paragraph of the individual observation to under convention no in a survey identifies comparable provisions in the domestic law of a number of other european states in section of the preceding and concluding provisions of the banks and credit activity act of excluded persons who had served the previous regime in certain capacities from employment in banks the ruled in that this provision was in violation of the constitution and of ilo convention no in the former the so-called screening act was passed in preventing persons who had served the previous regime in a number of capacities from taking up employment in the civil service or parts of the private sector this legislation was declared unconstitutional by the in which further found it to be incompatible with convention no however it remained in force in the while the ceacr urged the czech authorities to have due regard to the principle of proportionality in the application of the act in the state civil service act of and the police act of prohibit the employment of persons who worked for or with the kgb in the ceacr expressed its dissatisfaction with the above texts in the following terms the committee recalls that requirements of a political nature can be set for a particular job but to ensure that they are not contrary to the convention they should be limited to the characteristics of a particular post and be in proportion to its labour requirements the committee notes that the above-established exclusions by the provisions under examination apply broadly to the entire civil service and police rather than to specific jobs functions or tasks the committee is concerned that these provisions appear to go beyond justifiable exclusions in respect of a particular job based on its inherent requirements as provided for under article of the convention the committee recalls that for measures not to be deemed discriminatory under article they must be measures affecting an individual on account of activities he or she is justifiably suspected or proved to be engaged in which are prejudicial to the security of the state article of the convention does not exclude from the definition of discrimination measures taken by reason of membership of a particular group or community the committee also notes that in cases where persons are deemed to be justifiably suspected of or engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the state the individual concerned shall have the right to appeal to a competent body in accordance with national practice in the light of the above the committee considers the exclusions from being a candidate for any civil service position and from being employed by the police are not sufficiently well defined and delimited to ensure that they do not become discrimination in employment and occupation based on political opinion,case originated applications nos lodged court article

the case originated in an application no against the republic of turkey lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by a turkish national mr abdurrahman dilipak the applicant on july the applicant was represented by mr s. döğücü a lawyer practising in istanbul the turkish government the government were represented by their agent on april the application was communicated to the government the applicant was born in and lives in istanbul he is a professional writer and journalist and states that he is a human rights activist he published an article on the front page of issue of the weekly magazine türkiye de cuma friday in turkey which came out on august his article which was entitled if the pashas the generals refuse to obey contained criticisms of high-ranking officers who were about to retire he hinted that some generals in the armed forces were wont to sound false alarms concerning an alleged advance of fundamentalism and anti-secularism which they then used as a pretext for interfering in the country s general politics and that they appeared to have links with certain business circles the media senior civil servants and even the mafia endeavouring to create a political atmosphere that tallied with their worldview he suggested that the high-ranking officers in question should set up a political party on retirement and present their political projects to the people instead of deciding on the future of the nation on their own in the name of the nation he added that in his view the army generals who he claimed were interfering in the country s general politics were far removed from social realities and that in their approach to social affairs they lacked any empathy with and sensitivity towards the various social strata by an indictment of january the military prosecutor s office with the third army corps in istanbul applied to the military court within that corps for the applicant s prosecution under article and of the military criminal code which in the prosecutor s view penalised acts vis-à-vis high-ranking military officers geared to damaging hierarchical relations within the army and undermining confidence in commanding officers the applicant submitted an objection as to the jurisdiction of the military court to try him on the grounds of his civilian status and relying on the convention and his right to freedom of expression by a decision of july the military court declined jurisdiction in favour of the bakırköy assize court on the grounds that the offence at issue was not military in nature and the applicant should be tried by the non-military courts for denigration of the state armed forces which offence was punishable under article of the former criminal code the military court noted that by claiming that the armed forces were led by commanding officers who appeared to have links with certain business circles and even the mafia and to be far removed from social realities the applicant had tarnished the image of the whole armed forces it emphasised that the commanding officers who had been criticised were plenipotentiary representatives of the armed forces empowered to act on behalf of the latter on august the commanding officer of the third army corps lodged an appeal on points of law against the aforementioned decision to decline jurisdiction he submitted that the impugned article constituted an act which had to be assessed under article of the military criminal code he argued that the military criminal provision in question constituted a lex specialis vis-à-vis article of the criminal code the military prosecutor also lodged an appeal on points of law on the same grounds submitting that the military courts should have jurisdiction to adjudicate the case and that the applicant had not targeted all the armed forces but had undeniably tarnished the image of two generals which was liable to undermine the confidence of the rank-and-file in these officers and thus damage hierarchical relations within the armed forces the applicant was not apprised of the appeals on points of law lodged by the commanding officer and the military prosecutor both of which were added to the case file on may the military court of cassation which assessed the appeals on points of law quashed the decision declining jurisdiction and referred the case back to the military court in its reasoning the court of cassation mentioned the need to reclassify the facts and to assess them under article of the military criminal code it specified that the provisions of article of the military criminal code and the former article of the criminal code shared the same substantive and moral elements but differed in providing protection for individuals article and the institution itself article respectively the military court of cassation held that even though the applicant s article had comprised elements of both the aforementioned criminal offences the general tenor of the impugned article had apparently concentrated on the behaviour of two specific generals rather than the overall armed forces therefore the accusation that the officers were disobedient that is to say that they lacked discipline was liable to undermine the lower ranks confidence in them and thus damage hierarchical relations within the armed forces by a judgment of march the military court of first instance having reconsidered the case once again decline jurisdiction in favour of the non-military courts it stated that new legislation on the press attributed to the non-military criminal courts jurisdiction to hear and determine offences committed via the press and specified that such offences no longer came under special legislation on march the commanding officer of the third army corps lodged a fresh appeal on points of law against the military court s decision declining jurisdiction he pointed out that the may judgment of the military court of cassation had been delivered after the amendment to the legislation in question and that the provisions of the military criminal code law no enabling civilians to be tried by military courts had not been amended while the case was still pending before the military court of cassation law no of june made a series of amendments to the military criminal code inter alia abolishing military court jurisdiction for trying civilians for offences such as those with which the applicant was charged the prosecutor with the military court of cassation therefore referred the applicant s file to the military court of first instance accompanied by an opinion to the effect that the military courts had no jurisdiction in such matters by a judgment of november the military court once again decline jurisdiction and referred the case to the bağcılar criminal court meanwhile following the merger of the bağcılar and bakırköy judicial districts the case was referred to the bakırköy criminal court by a judgment of march the latter court declined jurisdiction and referred the case to the bakırköy criminal court which held jurisdiction for offences committed via the press by a judgment of may the bakırköy criminal court referred the case to the bakırköy criminal court on the grounds that that court was the former bağcılar criminal court by a judgment of march the bakırköy criminal court referred a jurisdictional dispute to the bakırköy assize court finally the bakırköy assize court decided in favour of the bakırköy criminal court in the jurisdictional dispute and referred the case to that court by a judgment of june the bakırköy criminal court declared the proceedings statute-barred under article of the military criminal code relying on article of the convention and article taken in conjunction with article the applicant submitted that he had been prosecuted for expressing his opinions he had criticised the higher echelons of the armed forces because in his view a number of senior officers had inappropriately interfered in the country s general politics he further alleged that the proceedings against him for offences involving denigration of the army or its commanding officers had marked him out as a target and had been such as to deter him from exercising his profession he took the view that those proceedings in conjunction with other criminal proceedings brought on the grounds of his articles had constituted a threat against him and also against all journalists dealing with political topics including the unlawful influence of military personnel on governmental affairs the court as master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case see for example söderman c. sweden gc no echr and tarakhel v. switzerland gc no echr extracts considers that these complaints must be assessed solely under article of the convention which provides everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. the applicant submitted that the military prosecutor s office at the request of the military authorities had charged him with criminal offences subject to sentences of several years imprisonment he added that his trial had lasted six-and-a-half years before the criminal courts two-and-a-half years of them before the military courts he explained that at the material time the military courtrooms had been located inside military areas access to which involved various checks and long complicated transfers he had spent all those years in fear under threat of conviction and incarceration in a military prison or of provisional detention in a military jail the applicant added that the commanding officers of the armed forces whom he had criticised regarding their interference which he considered unlawful and inappropriate in the general political activities of the government had subsequently been prosecuted and even convicted by the criminal courts for an attempted coup d état this demonstrated that his comments on the behaviour of the senior officers had not been gratuitous claims based on erroneous information but observations based on proven facts in a sphere which was of very great interest to the general public the applicant also submitted that in view of the other similar criminal and civil proceedings which had been brought against him the pressure exerted on him by the impugned criminal proceedings had become a genuine threat and had prevented him from writing about the military interference in general politics the accumulation of criminal and civil proceedings for his criticism of dysfunctions in the democratic system caused by the inappropriate interference of senior army officers had had an extremely dissuasive effect not only on himself but also on the whole journalistic profession the government reiterated that the applicant was not a victim because he had not been convicted by the criminal courts they pointed out that the prosecution instigated against the applicant had been abandoned on expiry of the limitation period the court reiterated that it has in the past found that certain circumstances which have a chilling effect on freedom of expression do in fact confer on those concerned persons who have not been finally convicted the status of victim of interference in the exercise of their right to that freedom for example a publisher ordered to disclose the identity of an anonymous information source even where that order was not enforced see financial times ltd and others v. the united kingdom no december the detention of investigative journalists for almost a year under criminal proceedings brought for very serious crimes see nedim şener v. turkey no july and şık v. turkey no july an announcement by a head of state of his intention not to appoint the applicant a magistrate to any other public office on the grounds that the latter had expressed an opinion on a constitutional issue which opinion had allegedly contradicted that of the head of state see wille v. liechtenstein gc no echr the court also reiterates that where criminal prosecutions based on specific criminal legislation are discontinued for procedural reasons but the risk remains that the party concerned will be found guilty and punished that party may validly claim to be the victim of a violation of the convention see among other authorities bowman v. the united kingdom february reports of judgments and decisions in the case of nikula v. finland no echr the court found that the conviction of a lawyer for mere negligent defamation on account of her criticism of the strategy adopted by the public prosecutor in criminal proceedings even if that conviction was ultimately overturned by the supreme court and the fine imposed on her lifted was liable to have a chilling effect on defence counsel s duty to defend their clients interests zealously furthermore criminal prosecutions of journalists instigated on the basis of criminal complaints and leading to a three-year stay of proceedings even though the criminal proceedings were lifted after that period in the absence of a conviction constituted interference on account of their dissuasive effect on journalists see yaşar kaplan v. turkey no january see to similar effect aslı güneş v. turkey dec. no may in fact individuals are entitled to claim that a law violates their rights by itself in the absence of an individual measure of implementation and therefore to claim to be a victim within the meaning of article if he is required either to modify his conduct or risk being prosecuted or if he is a member of a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation see for example burden v. the united kingdom gc no echr sejdić and finci v. bosnia-herzegovina gc nos and echr michaud v. france no echr and s.a.s v. france gc no echr extracts for example the court has accepted that the fear of a prison sentence for attacking another person s reputation see cumpănă and mazăre v. romania gc no echr or concern about a large and unforeseeable award of damages for defaming a politician see independent news and media and independent newspapers ireland limited v. ireland no echr extracts could have a chilling effect on the journalists concerned in that connection the existence of legislation very broadly suppressing the expression of specific types of opinion leading the potential perpetrators to adopt a kind of self-censorship can amount to interference with freedom of expression in the case of vajnai v. hungary no echr for example the court held that the uncertainties resulting from an overall legislative prohibition on a particular symbol in this case the red star could entail a chilling effect on freedom of expression and lead to self-censorship in the press in view of the different meanings of that symbol the court also found that the fact of being threatened with criminal prosecution owing to complaints lodged under article of the turkish criminal code which at the material time punished the denigration of turkishness a vague concept conferred on the applicant who had not yet been prosecuted never mind finally convicted the status of victim of interference in freedom of expression see altuğ taner akçam v. turkey no october in the present case the court observes that criminal proceedings were commenced against the applicant on charges of having damaged hierarchical relations within the armed forces and undermining confidence in superior or commanding officers an offence punishable under article of the military criminal code and/or having denigrated the armed forces an offence punishable under article of the former criminal code and article of the current criminal code by dint of a press article criticising the interference of certain active or retired commanding officers of the armed forces in the general policies conducted by the government the applicant lodged his application with the court at a time when his case was still pending before the national courts complaining of the criminal proceedings as such the court also notes that regardless of the replies to questions concerning the jurisdiction of the various courts depending on the classification of the offences with which the applicant was charged the latter was liable to be sentenced to a prison term of between six months and three years either for having denigrated the armed forces as a whole or having defamed certain generals in particular so as to diminish their status as superior officers the court further observes that the criminal proceedings which lasted six-and-a-half years including two-and-a-half years in military courts had finally been declared statute-barred nevertheless it is true first of all that criminal charges were pending against the applicant for a considerable indeed excessive length of time and secondly that the applicant could not be sure that he would not either during those criminal proceedings or at any future stage face further legal consequences if he as a journalist and political columnist wrote further articles on matters relating to links between the armed forces and the country s general politics see for an example of civil proceedings brought against an applicant on similar grounds dilipak and karakaya v. turkey nos and march the court considers that the six-and-a-half years of criminal proceedings conducted against the applicant partly before the military courts for very serious crimes in view of the chilling effect which those proceedings may well have caused can not be viewed as solely comprising purely hypothetical risks to the applicant but that they constituted genuine and effective restrictions per se the declaration that the proceedings had become time-barred merely put an end to the aforementioned risks but did not alter the fact that those risks had placed the applicant under pressure for a substantial period of time in view of the foregoing considerations under the particular circumstances of the present case the court rejects the government s objection to the effect that the applicant lacks victim status and finds that the criminal proceedings in question constituted an interference with the applicant s right to freedom of expression as secured by article of the convention the applicant submitted that there was absolutely no justification for accusing him of tarnishing the army s image by criticising a number of high-ranking army officers for having for strategic reasons sounded false alarms concerning a fundamentalist anti-secular threat nor could he have foreseen that he would be accused of denigrating the turkish armed forces by simply expressing opinions which were acceptable in public debate in any democratic state the government did not pronounce on that point reiterating that there had been no interference with the applicant s freedom of expression since the proceedings against him had become statute-barred the interference that is to say the commencement of criminal proceedings based on serious charges and their continuation for a considerable length of time had infringed article unless they met the requirements of the second paragraph of that article that is to say unless the interference was prescribed by law based on one or more legitimate aims for the purposes of that paragraph and necessary in a democratic society for the achievement of those aims the court reiterates that the expression prescribed by law requires firstly that the impugned measure should have a basis in domestic law it also refers to the quality of the law in question requiring it to be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them if need be with appropriate advice to foresee to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances the consequences which a given action may entail and to regulate their conduct the expression therefore requires that domestic legislation should be sufficiently clear in its terms to give citizens an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and the conditions on which public authorities are empowered to resort to measures affecting their rights as protected by the convention see for example gorzelik and others v. poland gc no echr maestri v. italy gc no echr sanoma uitgevers b.v. v. the netherlands gc no september bayatyan v. armenia gc no echr and fernández martínez v. spain gc no echr extracts in the present case the court notes that the applicant does not dispute the fact that the impugned measures had a basis in law that is to say article of the military criminal code and article of the former criminal code or article of the new criminal code and that those provision were accessible to him that raises the question whether the broad scope of such expressions as damaging the hierarchical structure of the armed forces and undermining confidence in superior or commanding officers article of the military criminal code or denigrating the armed forces article of the former criminal code and article of the new criminal code can diminish the foreseeability of the legal provisions in question as suggested by the applicant if the prosecuting authorities interpreted the expressions in question as being a means of protecting the views expressed by certain army officers on general political subjects against comments made in response to those views the court considers that serious doubts might arise as to the foreseeability for the applicant of his being charged under article of the military criminal code article of the former criminal code or article of the new criminal code however in view of its finding as regards the necessity of the interference see paragraph below the court considers it unnecessary to decide on this matter the court can accept that the impugned interference pursued the legitimate aims of national security and defence of law and order see yaşar kaplan cited above the court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society subject to paragraph of article it is applicable not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population see handyside v. the united kingdom december series a no castells v. spain april series a no jersild v. denmark september series a no prager and oberschlick v. austria april series a no and animal defenders international v. the united kingdom gc no echr extracts the court further reiterates that the press plays an essential role in a democratic society although it must not overstep certain bounds in particular in respect of the reputation and rights of others its duty is nevertheless to impart in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities information and ideas on all matters of public interest see de haes and gijsels v. belgium february reports the safeguard afforded by article to journalists in relation to reporting on issues of general interest is subject to the proviso that they are acting in good faith in order to provide accurate and reliable information in accordance with the ethics of journalism see for example colombani and others v. france no echr pedersen and baadsgaard v. denmark gc no echr and masschelin v. belgium dec. no november that does not prevent journalistic freedom from also covering possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration or even provocation see prager and oberschlick cited above the court also reiterates that there is little scope under article of the convention for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest see wingrove v. the united kingdom november reports and seher karataş v. turkey no july where the views expressed do not comprise incitements to violence in other words unless they advocate recourse to violent actions or bloody revenge justify the commission of terrorist offences in pursuit of their supporter s goals or can be interpreted as likely to encourage violence by expressing deep-seated and irrational hatred towards identified persons contracting states must not restrict the right of the general public to be informed of them even on the basis of the aims set out in article that is to say the protection of territorial integrity and national security and the prevention of disorder or crime see sürek v. turkey no gc no july nedim şener cited above and şık cited above as a matter of general principle the necessity of any restriction on the exercise of freedom of expression must be convincingly established clearly the national authorities are primarily responsible for assessing whether there is any overriding social need capable of justifying the restriction for which exercise they have a certain margin of appreciation but this goes hand in hand with a european supervision covering both the law and the decisions applying it including decisions taken by independent courts see for example sunday times v. the united kingdom no november series a no furthermore where the media are concerned as in the present case the margin of appreciation is circumscribed by the interest of democratic society in ensuring and maintaining a free press similarly that interest will weigh heavily in the balance in determining as must be done under article of the convention whether the restriction was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued see fressoz and roire v. france gc no echr in the framework of extremely careful scrutiny on the part of the court see mutatis mutandis sunday times v. the united kingdom no cited above moreover the dominant position occupied by state bodies requires them to show restraint in their recourse to criminal law especially if they have other means of replying to unjustified media attacks and criticisms see among other authorities nedim şener cited above and şık cited above it is the court s task in carrying out such supervision not to take the place of the competent national authorities but rather to review under article the decisions they delivered pursuant to their power of appreciation it must accordingly look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole in order to determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient in doing so the court must satisfy itself that the national authorities applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in article and moreover that they based their action on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts see among many other authorities goodwin v. the united kingdom march reports ceylan v. turkey gc no echr and animal defenders international cited above the court observes that in his impugned article the applicant accused certain generals of interfering in the country s general politics the applicant had levelled severe scathing criticism at the generals political projects and their approach to social affairs in turkey suggesting that they were sounding false alarms concerning an alleged surge of fundamentalism that they were using the latter as a pretext for interfering in the country s general politics that they seemed to have links with certain social milieus with a view to creating a political atmosphere that tallied with their worldview and that they lacked empathy with and sensitivity towards various social strata the court also observes that in bringing and then conducting criminal proceedings against the applicant the competent authorities considered that the applicant s criticism of these generals amounted to a desire to damage hierarchical relations within the army or to undermine confidence in those generals or more generally constituted denigration of the armed forces the competent authorities therefore prosecuted the applicant on the grounds of the criticism which he had levelled at specific views expressed by a number of generals concerning the country s political situation the applicant in expressing his reaction to the comments made by the generals which he saw as inappropriate interference by the army in the general political field was communicating his ideas and opinions on an issue which was indubitably a matter of public interest in a democratic society the court considers that when army officers or generals make public statements on general political topics they are exposing themselves like politicians or anyone participating in the debate on the subjects in question to comments in reply which may include criticism and contradictory ideas and opinions in a democratic society high-ranking military officers can not in this specific sphere claim immunity from possible criticism as regards the applicant s article the court does not consider that it was in any way gratuitously offensive or insulting or that it constituted incitement to violence or hatred the court takes the view that the comments did not comprise any insults or defamatory statements based on erroneous data or remarks advocating violent action against members of the armed forces under the circumstances the commencement of criminal proceedings looked rather like an attempt by the competent authorities to use criminal proceedings to suppress ideas or opinions considered as disruptive or shocking whereas in fact they had been expressed in response to publicly stated viewpoints concerning the sphere of general politics the court also considers that by prosecuting the applicant for serious crimes over a considerable length of time the judicial authorities had a chilling effect on the applicant s desire to express his views on matters of public interest it accepts the applicant s submission that commencing such proceedings is liable to create a climate of self-censorship affecting both himself and all other journalists who might be considering commenting on the actions and statements of members of the armed forces relating to general politics in the country the court refers here to its case-law to the effect that the dominant position occupied by state bodies requires them to show restraint in their recourse to criminal law especially if they have other means of replying to unjustified media attacks and criticisms see paragraph above in the light of the foregoing considerations the court holds that the impugned measure that is to say the continuation over a considerable period of time of criminal proceedings against the applicant on the basis of serious criminal charges subject to prison sentences did not meet any overriding social need that it was not in any case proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and that it was therefore not necessary in a democratic society there has accordingly been a violation of article of the convention,case originated application republic turkey lodged court article convention protection human rights fundamental freedoms

the case originated in an application no against the republic of turkey lodged with the court under article of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the convention by two turkish nationals mr fevzi saygılı and mr ali karataş the applicants on march the applicants were represented by mr k.t sürek a lawyer practising in istanbul the turkish government the government were represented by their agent the applicants alleged in particular that their conviction and the closure of the newspaper yeni evrensel had violated their rights under article of the convention on june the application was communicated to the government the applicants were born in and respectively at the material time the first applicant mr fevzi saygılı was the owner of a daily newspaper yeni evrensel the second applicant mr ali karataş was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper on january an article entitled friends i surely have to watch it ben mutlaka izlemeliyim arkadaşlar written by fatih polat was published on page two of yeni evrensel s issue it concerned a case that had caused a public outcry in turkey namely that of metin göktepe a journalist who was beaten to death by the police whilst under arrest in following the killing the turkish grand national assembly set up a parliamentary inquiry commission in order to shed light on the murder of metin göktepe on july the commission published its report which contained among other things the names the functions and the statements of numerous police officers including o.t and k.b the above-mentioned article read as follows this is what metin said i surely have to watch it to colleagues who were making their final preparations to observe the funerals of rıza boybaş and orhan özen two revolutionary detainees who had been killed in ümraniye prison four days earlier when he arrived at the newspaper office on january this was an expression of his commitment and involvement in life with a great enthusiasm which went beyond the mere love of his job the difference between doing this job journalism reluctantly and doing it wholeheartedly and flawlessly was apparent in his effort to report events fully notwithstanding the hindrances created by the police at alibeyköy where he went on the day of the events unlike his colleagues he perceived pushing against the police barricade as the means to reach the news behind that barricade what else was journalism for the barricade that stands in front of the reality that the people of turkey need stands in front of the journalist sometimes officially sometimes unofficially and sometimes in the form of a gang however when that barricade is broken down a dark bottomless well filled with the danger of being eliminated − to use the expression of the official susurluk report − is waiting in front of you to swallow you up in the last ten years alone fifty-one journalists have been swallowed up by this well the important message behind this is that we need determination to go beyond the darkness and reach the light or to put it a different way it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators ya da başka bir deyişle bertaraf ediciler bertaraf edilmeden karanlıktan sürekli aydınlığa çıkmak da mümkün değil following metin s death the honest journalists of turkey especially the young ones thought that waiting to confront that reality was a hopeless prospect indeed they thought that it was already too late it was also like this for the country s working class who constantly encountered the police in their struggle to seek legal solutions moreover metin was one of them this consciousness became the driving force behind the transformation of every hearing of his trial − which was exiled first to aydın then to afyon province with the aim of keeping it hidden from public view − into a demonstration we have learnt that the murderers will be tried and we are duty-bound to ensure the effective continuation of such proceedings this has been the only trial involving a journalist in which the murderers were punished notwithstanding the public authorities reluctance − which has taught us all that democracy is won not by waiting for it to appear from some place but by standing up for it and above all assuming that the protective ring around the former director of i̇stanbul security directorate o.t. who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin and around vice-director k.b. who executed this order would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles metin in ölümüyle sonuçlanan toplu gözaltı emrini veren dönemin i̇stanbul emniyet müdürü o.t ile bu emri uygulayan yardımcısı k.b. ın üzerindeki koruma halesinin sonsuza kadar öyle kalacağını düşünmek ise herşeyden önce verilen onca mücadeleye karşı bir inançsızlık olur all those following the case of metin göktepe will not stop coming after t. and b. who were already guilty in people s minds metin göktepe davasının takipçisi olanlar halkın vicdanında çoktan mahkum olan t. ve b. ın peşini elbette bırakmayacaklar the fact that the eliminators dragged one more name into their dark well after metin s namely that of ahmet taner kışlalı has shown another reality absolute protection from this fate requires constant and persistent monitoring is not one of the reasons why we are entering the third millennium with unsolved journalist murders the fact that those who occupy the seat and write the column of çetin emeç at hürriyet and those who occupy the seat and write the column of abdi i̇pekçi at milliyet and also the newspaper of the journalist i̇zzet kezer did not make it their business to reveal the murderers and all those responsible in the first place is there any solution other than coming after the eliminators whilst surely watching and removing them and their collaborators completely from our soil in order to save ourselves from becoming a country in which gangs can behave as they please on january the prosecutor at the istanbul state security court filed a bill of indictment with that court and charged the applicants with offences defined in section of the prevention of terrorism act law no namely disclosing the identities of public officials who are involved in the fight against terrorism thereby rendering such persons targets for terrorist organisations in addition he called for the application of additional section of the press act law no and article of the former criminal code in a petition dated may the applicants lawyer argued in their defence submissions that the crime of disclosing the identities of public officials who are involved in the fight against terrorism is not committed merely by using the officials names in connection with a case in which they have been tried as accused the applicants lawyer maintained that the persons were already known to the public due to their positions and that their names were already in the public domain he further contended that the applicants trial before the state security court was in contravention of articles and of the convention on june the istanbul state security court convicted the applicants as charged and sentenced them to heavy fines of turkish liras trl approximately euros eur at the relevant time and trl approximately eur respectively in accordance with additional section of law no the first-instance court also ordered the temporary closure of the newspaper for a period of seven days according to the brief reasons given by the istanbul state security court the following sentences from the article were sufficient to conclude that o.t and k.b had been rendered targets for terrorist organisations it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators and above all supposing that the protective ring around the former director of i̇stanbul security directorate o.t. who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin and around vice-director k.b. who executed this order would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles all those following the case of metin göktepe will not stop coming after t. and b. who were already guilty in people s minds. on the same day the applicants lodged an appeal they stated first of all that the article in question had been written on the fourth anniversary of the killing of journalist metin göktepe who had been beaten to death by the police in whilst in custody the applicants argued that the purpose of the article had been to raise concern over the fact that some high-ranking officials had not been tried and that those accused in metin göktepe s trial had still not been convicted four years after the death of metin göktepe the applicants maintained in this respect that the two officials concerned namely o.t and k.b. were the ones who had given and executed the detention order which had resulted in metin göktepe s death the applicants also pointed out that these two officials had been the only ones in respect of whom the requests for authorisation to prosecute under law no law on the prosecution of civil servants and public officials had been rejected by the interior minister at the material time the names of the two officials had therefore been mentioned in the article because of their involvement in the abovementioned events and not because of their role in the fight against terrorism the applicants further submitted that the names of the officials had already appeared in the public domain and that the officials being the director and the vice-director of istanbul security directorate were already known to the public and thus not in a position to complain about the disclosure of their identities as regards the content of the article the applicants observed that the writer of the article had defended the rule of law and the notion of justice and had not incited people to violence or advocated terrorism according to the applicants the article constituted a critical assessment of metin göktepe s trial and of the impunity of some high-ranking officials as well as the challenges journalists were facing the applicants emphasised that the sentence and above all assuming that the protective ring around the former director of i̇stanbul security directorate o.t. who issued the collective detention order which ended with the death of metin and around vice-director k.b. who executed this order would remain in place forever would represent nothing but a lack of faith in all these struggles had been a reference to the fact that no permission had been given under law no to authorise the prosecution of the two officials in question for their alleged criminal conduct in connection with the events surrounding metin göktepe s death they observed that with the sentence it is not possible to reach the light from the darkness without eliminating the eliminators the writer of the article had highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in their struggle to seek justice this being so they argued that it was untenable to conclude that the writer had in any way suggested the physical elimination of the two officials lastly they asserted that with the expression coming after the writer had obviously referred to the aftermath of metin göktepe s trial which contributed significantly to the punishment of the accused police officers according to the applicants the writer had wished the cases against the two officials to be followed up by the people of turkey with a view to bringing these officials to justice in their appeal application the applicants requested that the court of cassation hold a hearing they also complained about the application of additional section of law no on february the court of cassation rejected the request for a hearing and upheld the judgment the closure order for the newspaper was executed from to march at the material time additional article of the press law law no provided where there is a conviction for an offence mentioned in additional article and committed through the medium of press the court may order the closure of the periodical in which the article that constitutes an offence appeared for a period of from one day to fifteen days. at the material time article of the prevention of terrorism act provided it shall be an offence punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million turkish liras to announce that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person or a person who is presented in such manner that he or she may be identified without his or her name being specifically stated or to reveal the identity of civil servants who are involved in the fight against terrorism or to publish their names or to render them targets through these means,case originated application republic

were lodged at the registry on april and may by the applicant and on june by the government after consulting through the registrar those who would be appearing before the court the president directed on december that the oral proceedings should open on march rule on february the chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the plenary court rule the hearing took place in public in the on the appointed day immediately prior to its opening the court had held a preparatory meeting there appeared before the court for the government for the commission for the applicant the court heard addresses by mr bratza for the government by mrs thune for the commission and by mr makin for the applicant as well as their replies to its questions the applicant is a british citizen and was born on december following the death of his mother he was received into care by the liverpool city council under section of the children act the act on september save for five periods varying between one week and five months when he was discharged to the care of his father the applicant remained in voluntary care until june on that date the applicant appeared before the liverpool juvenile court and pleaded guilty to a number of offences including burglary and theft the court made a care order in respect of him under section of the children and young persons act the applicant ceased to be in the care of the liverpool city council on attaining the age of majority on december during the major part of the period while he was in care the applicant was boarded out with various foster parents subject to the provisions of the boarding-out of children regulations the regulations under the terms of those regulations the local authority was under a duty to keep certain confidential records concerning the applicant and his care see paragraph below the applicant contends that he was ill-treated in care and since his majority has wished to obtain details of where he was kept and by whom and in what conditions in order to be able to help him to overcome his problems and learn about his past on october the applicant was permitted by a social worker in the employment of the liverpool city council to see the case records relating to him kept by the social services department of the council in accordance with its statutory duty he removed those records without the council s consent retaining them in his possession until he returned them to the social services department on october it is the practice of the local authorities to keep a case record in respect of every child in care in respect of children boarded out they were and are under a statutory duty to keep case records by virtue of the regulations which were made under section of the act regulation of the regulations so far as relevant provides that a local authority shall compile a case record in respect of every case record compiled under this regulation or a microfilm recording thereof shall be preserved for at least three years after the child to whom it relates has attained the age of eighteen years or has died before attaining that age and such microfilm recording or where there is none such case record shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times by any person duly authorised in that behalf by the secretary of state in the applicant wishing to bring proceedings against the local authority for damages for negligence made an application under section of the administration of justice act the act for discovery of the local authority s case records made during his period in care section of the act provides inter alia that the high court shall have power to order such disclosure to a person who is likely to be a party to legal proceedings for personal injuries the application was heard by the high court on february the local authority objected to the grant of discovery of the records on the ground that disclosure and production would be contrary to the public interest the principal contributors to those case records were medical practitioners school teachers police and probation officers social workers health visitors foster parents and residential school staff their contributions to the case records were treated in the strictest confidence and it was in the interest of the effective conduct of the care system that such records should be as full and frank as possible if discovery were ordered the public interest in the proper operation of the child-care service would be jeopardised since the contributors to the records would be reluctant to be frank in their reports in the future the applicant contended that the case records held by the local authority should be made available to him on the general principles of discovery for the purpose of his proposed proceedings for personal injuries against the local authority he further argued that it was also in the public interest that some measure of review of the standard of care provided by a local authority to a child in care be available the judge did not read the records in question but balanced the public interest in maintaining an efficient child-care system with the applicant s private interest in receiving access to his case records for the purpose of the proposed litigation after referring to the case of re d infants weekly law reports wlr in which lord denning master of the rolls held that case records compiled pursuant to regulation of the regulations were regarded as private and confidential he concluded i am left in no doubt that it is necessary for the proper functioning of the child care service that the confidentiality of the relevant documents should be preserved this is a very important service to which the interests also very important of the individual must in my judgment bow i have no doubt that the public interest will be better served by refusing discovery and this i do the applicant appealed from this decision to the court of appeal on june the court of appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal in the court of appeal s view the high court in its judgment had correctly balanced the competing interests it added that the inspection of a document is a course which it is proper for a court to take in certain cases for example where grave doubt arises and the court can not properly decide upon which side the balance of public and private interests falls without itself inspecting the documents however this was not a case in which such doubt arose as would make it proper for the court itself to inspect the documents the high court s decision was accordingly affirmed and leave to appeal to the house of lords was refused gaskin v. liverpool city council wlr on october liverpool city council set up the child care records sub-committee the sub-committee to make recommendations on access to personal social services files and to investigate the allegations relating to the applicant on june the sub-committee recommended making available case records to ex-clients of the social services subject to certain safeguards and restrictions relating in particular to medical and police information as to the applicant the sub-committee viewed with concern the number of placements which he had while in care and which they recognised could be detrimental to a young person s development but found no evidence to suggest that the officers carried out their duties in other than a caring manner the applicant was to be allowed access to and to make photocopies of his case records subject however to the exclusion of medical and police information on june the sub-committee s recommendations subject to an amendment which would require the consent of members of the medical profession and police services to be sought to the disclosure of information which they had contributed were embodied in a resolution of the social services committee however mr lea a dissenting member of the sub-committee brought an action challenging the resolution and obtained an interlocutory court order preventing the city council from implementing it until the trial of the action or until further order on january liverpool city council passed a further resolution as regards future records this reiterated the general terms of the resolution of june and added certain further restrictions to protect information given in confidence and to provide for the non-disclosure of the whole or part of the personal record in particular cases but as regards information obtained and compiled before march it was resolved that this should be disclosed only with the consent of the suppliers thereof pursuant to this policy the resolution went on to instruct the council s officers to contact the various suppliers of information to the gaskin file immediately with a view to disclosure the local authority s officers were however ordered not to implement this resolution pending the outcome of the legal action brought by mr lea this action was discontinued on may and on june the local authority confirmed a further resolution to the effect that the resolution of january would be implemented as from september on august the department of health and social security issued circular lac local authority circular to local authorities and health authorities pursuant to section of the local authority social services act setting out the principles governing the disclosure of information in social services case records to persons who were the subject of the records the general policy laid down in paragraph of the circular was that persons receiving personal social services should subject to adequate safeguards be able to discover what is said about them in social services records and with certain exceptions should be allowed to have access thereto paragraph set out under five headings the reasons for withholding information these included the protection of third parties who contributed information in confidence protecting sources of information and protecting social service department staff s confidential judgments paragraphs to set out in more specific terms the policy governing client access to case records paragraph in particular defined the considerations to be weighed on the other side of the balance whenever an application was made for access the most relevant for the purposes of the present case being that information shall not be disclosed to the client if derived in confidence from a third party without the consent of the third party however it was then provided in paragraph that since existing records had been compiled on the basis that their contents would never be disclosed material entered in the records prior to the introduction of the new policy should in no event be disclosed without the permission of the contributor of the information on august the high court granted the attorney general leave to apply for judicial review of the resolution of january as amended by that of june on the ground that it went beyond what were considered to be the proper limits and in particular omitted certain important safeguards which were contained in circular lac pending the trial of the action an injunction was granted restraining the local authority from implementing the resolution of january on november liverpool city council confirmed a further resolution of its social services committee of october setting out certain additional grounds on which information should be withheld the resolution provided that the information in the applicant s file should be made available to him if the contributors to the file or as regards some information the director of social services consented and that the various contributors of the information contained in the file should be contacted for their permission before the release of that information following the passing of this resolution which was in line with government circular lac see paragraph above the attorney general withdrew his application for judicial review the applicant s case record consisted of some documents contributed by persons on may copies of documents supplied by persons were sent to the applicant s solicitors these were documents whose authors had consented to disclosure to the applicant the size of each contribution disclosed varied from one letter to numerous letters and reports those contributors who refused to waive confidentiality although not asked to give reasons stated inter alia that third-party interests could be harmed that the contribution would be of no value if taken out of context that professional confidence was involved that it was not the practice to disclose reports to clients and that too great a period of time had elapsed for a letter or report still to be in the contributor s recollection furthermore in june one contributor refused his consent to disclosure on the ground that it would be detrimental to the applicant s interests in a letter of july the director of social services of liverpool city council wrote to the applicant s solicitors in the following terms i refer to your letter dated june i would wish to be as helpful as possible to you but at the end of the day suspect that we may have genuine differences of opinion at least i take that to be the implication of the questions you asked i do not think therefore that we can take this correspondence further in a profitable way because as i have said it is in the last analysis for the provider of information retrospectively collected to release or refuse to release in their absolute discretion the information supplied from the ‘ confidential embargo originally accorded to it the reasons for releasing or not releasing are irrelevant whether they are good bad or indifferent i regret i do not feel able to help you further on april the access to personal files social services regulations came into force these regulations made under the access to personal files act and further explained in local authority circular lac impose upon social services departments a duty to give to any individual access to personal information held concerning him except for personal health information which originated from a health professional and subject to the exceptions in regulation this latter provision exempts from the obligation of disclosure inter alia any information from which the identity of another individual other than a social service employee who has not consented to the disclosure of the information would be likely to be disclosed or deduced by the individual who is the subject of the information or any other person who is likely to obtain access to it according to the government the effect of regulation is that in future case records will be compiled on the basis that the information contained therein is liable to be disclosed except in so far as disclosure would be likely to reveal the identity of the informant or another third party however by virtue of section of the access to personal files act the regulations apply only to information recorded after the regulations came into force that is after april as in the case of circular lac which governed the adoption of the resolution mentioned in paragraph above and the subsequent partial release of documents to mr gaskin the access to personal files social services regulations do not have retrospective effect the applicant applied to the commission application no on february he claimed that the refusal of access to all his case records held by the liverpool city council was in breach of his right to respect for his private and family life under article art of the convention and his right to receive information under article art of the convention he also invoked articles and art art of the convention and article of protocol no on january the commission declared admissible the applicant s complaint concerning the continuing refusal of liverpool city council to give him access to his case records but declared the remainder of the application inadmissible in its report of november article art the commission concluded by six votes to six with a casting vote by the acting president that there had been a violation of article art of the convention by the procedures and decisions which resulted in the refusal to allow the applicant access to the file it further concluded by eleven votes to none with one abstention that there had been no violation of article art of the convention the full text of the commission s opinion and of the partly dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment at the public hearing on march the government maintained the concluding submissions set out in their memorial whereby they requested the court to decide
